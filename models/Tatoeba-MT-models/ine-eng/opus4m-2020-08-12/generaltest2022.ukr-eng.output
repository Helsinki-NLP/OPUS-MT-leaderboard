In Herson, people went to a meeting again. The Russians were unable to escape.
As told to the agency by the members of the West, the Hersons were able to hold a meeting before they arrived at the scene to disarm the military rifle.
"We were able to hold a meeting, and now the riff technique has arrived," said one of the participants in the event.
In the past, citizens have traditionally gathered at protests in the area of Freedom, near the ODA building and the oblivion.
This area, like the building, is controlled by Russian armed forces, who use weapons against meeting members and steal people.
On April 3, armed Russian troops reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Dodecanese regularly take peaceful action against the Russian attacker.
Russian troops use force and weapons against people, are wounded and detained.
Russian predators also rob residents of the area.
President Volodymir Zelenski gave Herson a special name for the City Hero.
On February 24, President Rf Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are firing and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out mass fires in Ukrainian cities and forces using artillery, firefighting systems and ballistic missiles.

Green: Mariupol — Heart of War, Stop Fighting — We Will Have Weak Positions
President Volodymir Zelenski believes that the battles to the east of Ukraine and, in particular, to Mariupoli, will determine the course of the war – and if the U.S.S. is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupied the unoccupied territories.
Directly speaking, "Mariupole is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights -- we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They (the city’s defenders) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupoli, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (region) OSS, and if they're stronger, the conversation table will be closer to us and we'll have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to the cities that we now decoupled.
They can go for it.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Green said also that going to the negotiations after the beating of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in our possession."
Directly speaking, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think any peace will satisfy them under any conditions.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where millions of victims are, everything comes to an end to the war.
Yes, we must fight – but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, no people."
Good morning, do you still have room for Czech courses for adults from 7:00 a.m. on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality status.

The head of the Ministry of Defence's investigation has published a list of Russian military officials who have been involved in the war crimes in the Bay of Kiev area.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported in Facebook by the Ministry of Defence’s Department of Investigation.
"Every citizen should know their names!
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 individual military officers of a single gunfighting brigade who are directly involved in the prosecution of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in Boucha," reports the report.
The HOUR MOU notes that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be held accountable.
The list can be viewed by reference.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpina, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were freed from Russian predators.
In the freed cities and villages, mass killings were recorded by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, Butchi Anatolius Fedoruk reported that 280 people had been buried in brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktov stated that on April 3rd, 410 bodies of civilians were taken out of the Russian outlaws of the Kyiv territory.
On February 24, Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin, announced the beginning of a massive invasion of Ukraine.
Russian warheads are firing and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive firefights in Ukrainian cities and forces using artillery, firefighting systems, ballistic missiles, aviation bombs.
Good morning, I'm sorry, but I can't work with you because I'm going to fly to Canada as soon as I can.

I think I've gained experience from every situation for myself so that I don't repeat mistakes again.
The directives are in the form of numbered written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure there won't be a problem.

It depends on religion.

We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
Well, I've got two months' rent money, so the Olomouc area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of animal abuse from the civilian population north of Kiev.
The photographs of the people being shot and shot confused the entire civilized world.
Tens of people are questioning each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
And I wasn't surprised at anything.
I drove my children and older parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then a girl friend with the kids, and then she went back to work in the capital.
Since 2014, I have been helping the U.S.A. in a number of ways, and I have no doubt that in the case of the occupation, my family will not be deprived of the status of Kiev.
Because I was and I was absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communist regime had remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it just can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my ancestors was shot in a prison in the city of Gjitomir.
A few years ago, in the gypsum U.S.A., a copy of the predisposal case was removed: the whole case was over a hundred pages, and the sentence for the loss was very simple and even more horrifying.
The defendant was illiterate, denied the guilt.
The ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was from the free people, a poor "backyard" way, never walked in the cracks.
The fact that they lived on the kegs and had several cows was enough to tell the smell and the rudder of young children to die.
The parents did not even know about the place of burial.
Grandma said that she had taken nearly a hundred people from the village and had killed all but two people who had agreed to give a false witness.
In the criminal case, there's the name of Sharia's knocker.
Our former High Council speaker comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I'm not surprised if his relative was a CDBist informant.
The apple from the apple, as you know, falls...
The devastating three that led to the loss of the peasants were ethnic Russians.
In his analysis of the case, he was interested in various sources of information.
There's great (no sarcasm) information resources like the "Immortal Barrack" on Russians, which remind you of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, the descendants of the NQVDs have found ways to punish and destroy almost all those who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found files with child pornography on their computer, put them in jail, and they died fast.
The CDBists are now killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Why, then, do you suddenly marvel at their actions now?
It focuses on the most hungry qualities of human nature.
Over a thousand-year ordinal tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism were imposed in the 16th-19th century.
And then over what happened, an animal genetic experiment was done, cutting the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the mid-French film "Chekyst" in 1992.
Because you saw my photo in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from the castle?
I'm sorry. I don't have to ask anyone.

Honey, does Igor ask you if you can drive tomorrow? (He's out and he can leave because he hasn't seen the car today.)
We're not really comfortable worrying about you so much.
You are very helpful, thank you!
In the Borodian under Kiev, the bodies of 7 civilians are discovered in the process of understanding the collapses of two multi-story residential buildings.
Mariupola’s defenders reported spilling over the city of an unknown poison from a Russian pilot.
Three people were injured.
About 1,700 Ukrainian defenders and civilians are held in Russian prisons.
Among them are 500 women.
Germany will allocate 1 million euros to support the International Criminal Court, which investigates the war crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine.
Canada has imposed sanctions on 33 Russian defence companies.
One enemy tank, three drone carriers, three artillery systems, 24 car units, one helicopter and three unmanned pilots were destroyed during the war in eastern Ukraine.

When do girls return from their training?
We've come to a place where we've been settled from the center of the perdubium, conditions are good.
But there's a big but there's men living here drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, the loud music is the very minimum that's sad, the smell of cigarettes drunk men and us and the kids... sleeping awfully if honest.
Please help with the housing, please, for the money.
But where it's safe and unscathed.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, maybe right here they smoke.
I beg you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like.
I'm just praying if you can help.

Everyone's tracking the Facebook page.
They asked you to give them a greeting and say that it's very interesting for them to read the news.
There's still talk about people of Roman nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And they agreed that if the child and the parents don't understand the Czech at all, then after work, I can help them in telephone mode.

There's a chance for everyone.
Above all, love is real and mutual.

And I have a problem with that if I don't love a man, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took her home and drove her aunts right away.
She was very grateful, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you were helping the Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
She said if that might be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessarily, only if it is, I'm very grateful to you, too.
I feel sorry for him.
They killed my best friend in front of him.

I can't call a doctor because I haven't done a food license check yet.
But I can't call him because I'm done with the money.
I can't fill the phone because I don't understand it in Czech online banking, and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't.
In addition, I can't even change the tariff to have normal calls and the Internet to fill in.
I'm crazy.

As "European Truth" reports, it's written by the World with reference to sources in government circles in Ukraine.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 goubles, including the educational set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As is also the case for gaubits in BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in the battle have to be collected relatively close to the opponent’s goals, Panzerhaubitz 2000 can lead to a fire more than 20 miles [30 km] away.
According to a report by the Ukrainian government, with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of highways will follow a circular scheme.
In the shortest terms, the Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its shells, and the gaps that have been created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new goubies can be placed 30 months after signing the contract — before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
And this is the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

4. In 2022, refugees from the war in Ukraine can ask for humanitarian assistance at the new workplace of the Office of Labour in the Prague Market.
The branch office in Room No.29 is specially designed to provide and process applications for help, so there is a translator in place.
Lydia was already admitted to school, but because of the illness, we will go to the teacher on Tuesday I announced today
I sit, I keep my ears on, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, honey, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm going to deal with this in a way that we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'd be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I'll find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know how it's going to be with the house.
I need to go through the food license exam.
Please indicate tomorrow for 5 guests to cook the apartment.
Fifth place I mean in the TV room?
Plan and paint the couch?
Can we stop you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one they used, but it's working, but it's not necessary.
Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan anything with the furniture I want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what kind of furniture I need
I'm sorry she answered so long, it was a working day, it's hard to adapt.
That's enough?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, to have such an opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how you feel.
For the baby, there's already a bed and a bath, things found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me with your chances, but you won't give up the last.
I want to make a cut called the hat.
Oleg's disease is not living and coughing, and she's better not to take her to us so that she doesn't get infected.
I'll just be a little bit later -- about 8:00, okay?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm going to make sure everything's okay?
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm silent about myself (for me it's just the top I can't reach)!
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry. I just woke up.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cole and I had begun a bad test last night.
I'm going to ask if Gregory Denisenk or maybe Jonashek) to help me with a little bit of math.
Can I help them with anything?
If that's possible, I'd like to draw mathematical terms for the output.
The geometry is quite difficult, but we have to work with Cole so that there's no error.
Thank you for testing it.
We also look forward to this.
And so she's very happy with any gift
I wanted to connect the Internet to my Czech number.
Yesterday, at the stop of 402 buses, I met a Ukrainian named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because she's the first person in Ukraine to feel my heart together.
Branch in Room No.29 is specially designed for supplying and processing applications for help
Turns out I ordered a backup card.
No, I'm just a man.
So she wouldn't be afraid no one came.
I didn't go, I did, I did, I could do it, I'm sure you taught me how to turn on the windshield.
So you've been out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Holocaust Center of Babin Yar, in Kiev, we had 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He was talking about "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own way and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We need to protect this basis, which is also part of our responsibility to our history."
"If the evil demons of the past appear today in a new suit," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia attacks a peaceful country, bombes and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of blocked cities, and kills them from disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shoots of Ukrainians, even visually reminding of shoots in Babin Yaru.
For more than a month, Germans have seen this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been so far unimaginable.
Germany withdraws the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastika.
This means combating all possible means of mass murder, genocide, war crimes, and animals.
There is no easy way to conquer evil without risk and sacrifice and to stop the beast that is taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a trip, and write down when we meet
All the sick only Lydia wasn't sick in them was a new micron.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this tablet instead of a pen.
Be aware of the delay.
The ticket cost me in the manager's office on January 2000
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a long way off
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of the Ukrainians were against NATO entry and only 18% of the respondents were "for".
After the Innocent Revolution, the escape of Victor Janukovich, the annexation of Crimea, and the beginning of the Donbasa war, NATO’s opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the start of the war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record of Ukraine’s support for NATO’s accession to the Ukraine’s citizens, more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO's entry and for NATO's aid in war conditions, there are now many criticisms on behalf of the Alliance and members of the country -- for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the refusal to "fight" Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up wanting to join the Alliance because of the position of the FF if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the "Creative Questions" podcast together with the editor of "European Truth" we are talking about how Ukraine has helped the Alliance since the Russian invasion, what NATO should be criticised for, and why the Alliance is criticizing in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is as close as ever in history and why the security guarantees discussed during the talks with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I've got a partner in my volt that my statement is under consideration.
I gave it to her because of this mobile plug-in.
There are no visas, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was designed in Poland, there were no visas, and there were no pessals.
We'll have to write to you!
Dennis was in a good mood today.
He made an appointment with a boy from Ukraine he met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because then I don't love, I don't have enough.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine and infantry war machines
I'm going to leave my children there for three or four years, and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And take 6-7 in the morning with you.
Yes, there was a heart disease.
I had a real feeling about this man, but he didn’t do very well, and I left him.
Some time later, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then after a while, he phoned what had been done to him.
I just asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of association.
At that time, problems at work began in parallel.
His support also helped me back then.
Such mutual help.
And I thought maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and he died two days later.
So God has decided our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only talks in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy with this advice, so I have to live where I am and where I have to be with the child.
Did I have to remember before?
) Because I helped to look at children in the family.
Don't apologize, it's just a text that doesn't make sense.
I realize that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, or should she give the paper?
These must have been the guests who forgot. I put them in the closet.
Maybe you need some sleep to work tomorrow.
Is there anyone who can help, the things that a woman needs are XS or S growth 165. And also her daughter (8, 10, 12 years old) Thank you.
That's when I bought two packs in the ice, and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, give me something else, and I'm not sleeping, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming about being bombed...
God will never be late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the price of unskilled work and I understand that the work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I made at home, I won't get here either.
But I just can't sit down and do nothing, because then every bad thought in my head is so I have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are prepared from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., otherwise we can just wait.
Volodymir returned at 4:00 a.m.
That's why we took them to us.
We arrived with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When he's with you, write it down and find out what's next...
And then I can't find a place.
Sir, please, these are Ukrainian children's invitations to go to high school.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.
With work I don't know, I'd love to have kids in the garden and school.
That's what we've been planning.
I'm sorry, I really don't have missed calls from the middle.
I'm offering work, bathroom cleaning and toilets, 3 window washing, dusting.
It's about three or four hours.
I hope I'll just tell you that we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or can you write down your wife’s contact?
I'd like to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
Hannah is considered to be the root species of ana
She was handed over by her uncle.
Making an English version, adding new partners
Write to him if you need anything.
Just don't forget about me, please.
Does it differ in Monday and in the middle?
Thank you very much, you're doing so much for our family.
Help is needed to be in the pool
But that's what I think.
My uncle handed her the rolls and the board for the torture, she was throwing at them at home, so it's got
I also got up at 9:00, and I'm just getting ready for breakfast.
I'm so ashamed that you're communicating with me on your way out, and I hope I'm not too boring.
We want to inform you about the change of location and provide documents to continue the map
We're now giving the medical oxygen to all the hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you there's going to be a taste tomorrow.
One mother said it's hot for kids with pancakes.
He's coming to you in the guest room.
Please tell me, do you have an approximate monthly cleaning schedule, even for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule at all.
The Russian army is threatening to launch a missile strike on Kiev, saying, "they haven't done it before."
Directly, Konashenko says, "We see the attempts at diversion and the task of striking Ukrainian troops on objects in the territory of the RF.
If such cases persist, the RF armed forces will strike at decision-making centres, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army was previously held."
The Russians have been hit by rockets on Kiev since the first days of the massive invasion of the RF occupying forces in Ukraine.
On February 25th, a remnant of Russian missiles that broke down the Ukrainian PHO system fell on a multi-dwelling building in the capital Poznak.
On February 26, the Russian missile entered a multi-story area on the prospect of Valeria Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians entered a television station near Babin Yaru, resulting in the death of five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine’s PHO systems hit over the South Railway Station, Russian rockets flying toward the Ministry of Defence’s building.
March 14, the wreckage of the bombers destroyed the house and trolleybus in Kyiv.
On March 18, Russia’s rocket entered a housing facility in Vinogradara, one of which killed, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville TRC in Vinogradara, killing at least 4 people.
On April 13th, Mer Kieva Vitaly Clicko said that the residents of the capital who had been evacuated from the city had to return as soon as possible.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still carry out missile attacks on Kiev, as well as many mines and unexploded ammunition in the area of the capital.
On 12 April, the head of the Ministry of Defence's investigation warned that the Russians were planning the first series of attacks on the territory of the RF in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army to the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil tank exploded near Belgrade in Russia, as if it were a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgrade claimed that the "Ukraine weapon" fell close to the city.
Apparently, the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold pit from the very idea that Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine will be hit by the mob.
But Zelenski does not talk as much with them as with their voters and societies in general.
By his speeches in Parliament and before the thousands of crowds in the areas of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Green is not convinced by European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he is convinced by this European people who choose those politicians.
And these discourses, this refined flow of power, emotions, and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
By the same time that Baiden categorically opposed the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens have already supported this idea.
Although Paris and Brussels are opposed to speeding up Ukraine's accession, the process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a joke.
The cost you will collect is better than giving to people who are in need.
I can come to you and we'll decide.
But the air is clean, that's plus
It says I've got a "Two-on-two without the Internet" tariff, I asked you to do the Internet.
I don't understand the tariff condition.
Do we have any more room today, or do we always have only the stairs down?
So I'm on my way and you're on your way.
But I'm not gonna stop loving you, you're all for me.
The loan is made by a financial adviser.
So it takes a few days.
Kata asked for an Internet password.
I thought you and Milan didn't shoot each other.
Then my husband will drive me because he has a car for today from the construction company where he works.
How happy and grateful we are that our Nica and her grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you so much for the invitation!
We also hope that after the war we will be able to invite you to Ukraine!
One must be cut to 4 parts
One of these parts can be used for 2-3 days, but every year, it's going to collapse.
I'm interested in architecture and color
I'm so glad you're all right.
Soon, at 16:20, the concert will start at 6:00 and then I'll be free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet
So let me make some tea and get some sugar.
I'm going to go to the school page and I'm going to try to order Annie's dinner tomorrow.
But to go out in great love
So we can get there tomorrow, find out what the conditions are?
My name is Sasha and I came from Lugansk to Prague.
I'm a certified massager and nurse with a 27-year-old intern in the field of neurology.
I offer medical massages, a rehabilitation training room for children and adults.
I speak Ukrainian, Russian, and Czech.
Contact:------ I'd like a letter to be able to write to you through the translator, text here doesn't go, they don't have Ukrainian keyboards, and if they call you, you don't agree.
You really don't want this price?
He is very helpful in helping people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a press release, I won't put it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn't want me to write today... something.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask.
Actually, I'm just asking for some attention today.
I mean a lot today, so I'm asking you to be patient.
Are you all right with the idea?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, take a vacation.
You have a dream.
You're planning on buying this dress that you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't accept that.
He's squeezing for the old reality.
You call for work, find out if you're going out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... we'll make a deal... there'll be something.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where are you going?
I've got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders did not pay for our work.
Where am I going?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you'd go 1,000 miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or no.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag your children all over Prague.
What's next?
And we don't have it out of every desire.
We have a choice to stay there and call the children in danger or try to save ourselves here.
She was very happy with the heart and the things that her children gave her when she came to school
I needed to call you when you came.
I'll write you dinner.
Yes, I believe in God and trust in him
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you fell in love with some Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to talk.
I've got it in my menu, I've even ordered it.
2. Would you like to have a social gathering with your Czech neighbors, friends, and communities?
If so, what kind of thing do I look like?
Please send a visa page or a stamp (red with date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian aid.
Mrs. Libush, is that what you paid for?
Because I can't understand.
You are doing us so much good....
We're in great debt to you... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
I'll take your picture of the lady I'm teaching English.
Well, if you write tomorrow, we'll meet or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough people. It's so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What You Have in the First Week of Your Life
Carina brought us the drugs in the morning, and we're drinking them.
I can work with sick and disabled children.
But I have to say that I speak only Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have one.
I can have a nice break for you guys.
Because there's only an antibacterial gel.
I'm not going to say it because I'm not very oriented in the city.
What services/activities do you think are needed/ absent for older people?
I don't know because there wasn't a text from the bank yet, and I didn't take the bank's card, and the kids took out the bank's application, and they really upset me.
Then please write me how you're going.
Today we have the joy of being free from the occupations of our city of Butch, our armies.
They're looking for Russians in the basements and in the apartments.
The whole city's being replaced, the exchange is going to start.
And John would look, maybe something there needs to be repaired or something else to be done.
Diana, whatever you want, maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Our Panas wants to stay home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We will teach the anointed and teach them.
These are small businesses that have been bribed by volunteer staffs in their premises and shops.
They're tractors that actually go out in the field, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go to rubber homes in temporary occupied territories to get help and get people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who fearlessly travel to the war zone, calm down and help refugees in their cars, and help volunteers to load the humanitarian vans at the peaceful stations.
These were the drivers who stood on the Gitomir Trail during the first days of the war and who patiently served the people who were frightened and nervous.
These are the locals who take the garbage out, repair the plumbing and the power lines to provide the people they need.
They are doctors and nurses who save people for 24 hours a day without complaining, and they volunteer for a free minute to collect the drugs on the front.
We're in Ukraine, we're out of silk when there's little leaves.
Tell me, please, what age do you mean?
My daughter, 8 years old, is that acceptable?
I'm looking for a place with my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and pass passports to make a visa in Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people in the travel center and they don't work online.
I wanted to come for one day, but this is far away, it takes a long time to get on the train, and the child will be hard.
So she decided to search for a place in or near Prague.
No, we're all set up.
Yesterday's Devices to Take
But I can't change the password when I go through the link because I'm making a mistake like this:
It's in the microwave, something burned.
In Ukraine, the largest bank operators are always in contact with customers 24 hours a day and all questions are quickly resolved :)
Well, I'll get used to new realities.
I'm very unhappy, and I want you to know.
You can edit a letter, and most importantly, it's true.
Yeah, TV's full of it.
We've already arranged for the refrigerators to respond to some of the Czech boys at 13 a.m. and they'll be able to move.
I want to go to you. I want to hug you and kiss you.
at 7.30 I read the history of the world theatre to actors, directors and theatremakers
I appreciate the projects tonight. After dinner.
Grisco's still asleep, crying a lot at night, licking his teeth.
Now I'm on the phone with everybody I know from Lviv, and a lot of people have died.
The Czech Republic began to issue visas after March 22, my opinion.
Before that time, they put the stamps like this and then they compared these prints to visas.
The Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (Ukraine VOC) is a electoral district that unites electoral units located outside Ukraine's territory and consists of the polling stations in Ukraine's embassies and consulates and military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and the Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is carried out by the Central Electoral Commission.
There are only public elections in the Foreign Electoral District: the election of the President and the national deputies and all-Ukraine referendums.
Local elections are not held in the VOC.
They're at the train station next to the mother's and the baby's room.
She says she doesn't understand where they're going anymore.
Are you mad at me?
I'll take a photo in the bathroom.
I don't need the money anymore. I borrowed my friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I've already connected the Czech mobile number.
So I didn't need another device, I went to operator O2 and they made me an electronic SIM card that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
Thank you. I'm not comfortable, Sunday's working and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, pillows, plates. There's no pajamas in the kids and there's nothing to move into.
Good morning, I'm going to go out at 10:00... write the address again.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm going to break into myself.
That would be good, but I know there was no free space, and in principle, they now have all the lessons on schedule and they teach pretty well.
Do you have a butcher to make a farsh?
Have a good day.
Yesterday your mom said something hurt you?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand everything they're saying.
She went to school today.
Today, I saw Christine’s mother, but she did not even greet her.
Very delicious apples, what kind of apples?
The head of President Andrey Jermak's Office reported that Russia is starting a "faecal operation" on the weapon that the allies are handing over to us.
Directly, Jermak says, "They understand that they're losing war, seeing their distance and wanting to "break up" the arms supply by any means.
For example, one of the last faeces is the imminent destruction of the Slovak KRK P-300.
This information has already been clarified by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's next? We know Russian scenarios, and I'll call one of them.
They can launch faeces that the Ukrainian soldiers are reluctant to give up their arms from the allies, and it's a massive turn on the Russian army's weapons.
I want to warn you right away.
Because weapons in the hands of U.S. soldiers are exclusively sending the enemy to that world.
Excuse me, please, have you forgotten to ask how much bull to cost the garden in the month and will it work in the summer?
Each one is given the strength.
There are far more dubious stories, believe me.
So I needed to survive these events in order to change.
It is written in Torah, and God created in man a wicked beginning to change spiritually during his life course

I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you make a phone call today for a change in the mobile operator's tariff?
I'm sorry, but I can't expect anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job every day.
I'm sorry, but I agreed to work there.
Thank you for answering me, and I want to find you a nice help.
Your father may have told you that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I don’t preach any religion.
However, she was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions whose foundation is love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there is no mediator between man and God.
You can still think about not putting the refrigerator next to the door in the boys’ room.
Thank you so much for helping me.
We're looking for a lawn mower to clean up the apartment here in the village.
Offering 150 kroner/hour. Another collaboration with them. Date to agree with the lady.
I'm afraid of chemical care.
I'm just worried about how we're gonna hang out with you.
But we can just look at each other at each other's jokes.
I went to my mother's, and there my sister and I were going to go, and Anastasia asked them.
Where's your good wig?
Good day Victor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this gentleman with documents to get a paycheck from the state and talk to the furniture bank while there's no furniture.
But thank you very much for your hospitality in your session.
We've got doctors here, too.
We've been cooking food at home, and we can't find the keys from the heat.
I'll take my underwear to the fifth guest, and the pillow and clothes are extra in the apartment?
Yeah, but when we get in touch with the owners, there's no contact, I'm gonna need a long-term residence we're working on and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of every description you have contact with the owner.
You can use this Ukrainian-to-Ukraine-to-Ukraine-to-Ukraine-to-Ukraine-to-Ukraine-to-Ukraine-to-Crobe-to-Crobe-to-Crobe-to-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-To-Crobe-Crobe-To-Crobe-Crobe-Crobe-To-Crobe-Crobe-To-
I'll have four of us in one bed in the room where you can't even go around, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on the links I sent you earlier?
Each of them has a free offer of accommodation, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't just find an e-mail, I'm afraid there's nothing going to happen to me that lives closer to Czech Krumlov and we work in Czech Krumlov and now we live in Prague.
Then I won't help you.
Thanks for the help, we found a place, but we need a bed and a couch, you might tell us where you can buy a cheap budget because we're weak, thank you very much.
Can you say it's bad eating and often hurts your stomach too?
I saw your publication on the Music Project.
I'm the headmaster of the National Educational University of Dragomanov.
I'll be happy to cooperate.
In the meantime, Russia displayed its missile complexes on the border with Finland.
They want to try not only the Ukrainian penis but also the Finnish penis
I'll be the happiest when I'm with you.
When I wake up next to you.
I'm all over you and I say, "Good morning, honey, you look very beautiful."
Where can you buy a moving ear hat?
There's a lot of work to do today.
Aren't we stopping you?
Is that not to be given as an assignment?

We cleaned up the whole room and moved into the second room.
The international community continues to express shock and indignation after evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation. ”
"Reports of the killed, raped and severely injured Russian military civilians are worthy of conviction," Prime Minister of New Zealand told reporters in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that its government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called incidents "a violation of international law".
After reports of hundreds of peacekeepers being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets of the capital city of Kiev, in Buchy, the Russian troops who left the area after their occupation for several weeks.
The photographs, which appear to be images of the bodies of the dead civilian with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on 4 April, which is a sign that the Russian army has committed "war crimes" in Buchi.
"What happened in Butch requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian troops could go so far as to make the genocide in Buchi.
"We will do everything we can to ensure that those who committed these war crimes are not executed," said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late April 3rd, the Russian M.S.A. spokesperson Maria Zaharova rejected the charge as “provocation. ”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO "ordered" images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after these materials appeared does not raise any doubt as to who "ordered" this story," said Zaharova.
Earlier, the Russian Minoband also had no evidence to show that Buchi’s image was “one more establishment of the Chinese regime ” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on 4 April to discuss what it called the "provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in Buchi.
On April 4th, Russia's next committee issued a statement declaring the "investigation" for the accusation of Ukraine's "consciously false information" about the actions of Russian troops in Buchi.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski made his statement on 3 April, accusing the Russian troops of "genocide" in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they had to come to Buchi to see what they had done to their army.
"I want all leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out," Zelenski said in a video presentation, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting at a gunman," he said.
He claimed that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian military, should bear responsibility for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with their hands tied to their backs and their heads, I don't understand," he said about the scene of the victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, the city about 35 kilometers north-west of Kiev.
On April 2, the Ukrainian Radio Freedom correspondent visited the streets of a small city of the body, like civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
Journalists of AP have seen at least 21 bodies in different locations in Bouchi.
The bodies of one group of nine -- all in the civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kyiv area, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told that Kiev was gone." As the occupants of the floor, the Ukrainians were taken to Russia and Belarus.
Russian invasions in Ukraine are accompanied by horrific acts of robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another item on this list that is now much less information — the removal of the local population to the enemy’s territory.
About mid-March, Russian occupations are "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements into their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-declared President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military site.
The "Ukraine Truth" has been searching for the expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the "evacuation" itself is happening and whether there is a way to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary and forced evacuation outside of Ukraine under psychological pressure and without exit.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain their relationship with their family.
However, in view of the statements made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were forced into Russia and Belarus under severe pressure.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second foster home, drove out children without parents, including 12 - year - old Miroslava, daughter of a Ukrainian dead champion from the swimming of Joseph Zechepinski.
The Aleksandra, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Vali, moved to Hostomell in a few months to war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civil.
As the real plastics, Dennis and Marina collected some alarming bags in advance, but on February 24th, they failed to evacuate.
They did not have their car, and the local buses did not take anyone.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first tools.
One of them entered a neighbor’s house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17th, until the Russian troops took them to Belarus.
About 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not all decided.
"On the 6th night of February 24th, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the driveway.
They say, "Who is it?" - I say yes. - "Get out!"
They were looking for me, asking who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you by the command of Ramzan Kadriv."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even an army, young boys 25-35.
They said, "Since the Ukrainians helped us in the war, Saško Bili (commanded by the UN-UNSO Viking Nationalist Movement), who was fighting side by side with Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen War, U.S.A.), we have now come to help you."
On the third day, they asked what was not enough for us.
We say water was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the "although Russians take them" and brought us six bottles.
There are still videos on the Internet where children thank Kadiro for his food.
That's how they brought a cowboy after they robbed the store and said, "We understand this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatović."
No one especially wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid there says, "You have 7 days to give up our phones," they laughed.
They still kept separate from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians supported and generally good, "Putin is a bastard, Kadiro, too, but we can't do anything, because there's our families."
And mostly they didn't fight, but they were going to rob the shops, they were jamming.
Kurey was tied to one leg of a Georgian tape, and to the other, his white scott and he was called a "cold."
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their exploration worked... when they were shot at Butch, so they didn't even take the killed, they asked us, "What do you have, artillery?"
In addition, we had a setback — Chechens didn’t know each other, and in the first few days, they asked for passwords to find out who they were or who they were.
They were with us until March 13th, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and they were followed by a male dean.
They put 30-40 units between the houses -- ours are always falling into it from the Barracks.
But these came and told us that the U.S.S.A. doesn't exist anymore, but there's "Azov," and according to them, "Azov" is like a thousand in Ukraine.
I've been running Kiev since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian, or a retired officer, or an FSB representative, came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was about Butch, Hostomel, we thought maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We're saying we don't want to go there or there.
What they said was, "That's what your children's psychotics are all about!"
As it worked, they drove us into the basement and started shooting at us from under the house, either by the City or by the Minomet.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them went down.
Our house had a direct connection to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the immigrants and to the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the country, saying, "You're being shot there, they're gonna sell to the organs."
We were taken through Chernobyl, both sides of the road were hot, broken technique, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were taking the technology right away.
A lot of coconspirators, buried techniques, and soldiers.
On the Belarus "Commar" pass, we've had an improvised checkup, many who were completely undocumented, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And this is where we hear gunshots!
Although the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these planes fly, they turn on the cord."
But we're from the air, we have education, we understand what it is.
We were then taken to the bus station and taken to Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager came, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, saying, "Here, I'm a hole, I'm from Montenegro.
But I understand Putin and Lucashenk won't stop until they get these thieves.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lucashenko so good!
He'll say, he'll do it."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but nobody wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN representation (at least they were called) have spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
At the Ukrainian consulate, we had no help, and in Minsk, at the train station, we were told that nobody would take anyone on the bus without passports.
I'm going to say that we had a lot of help from the Belarusian volunteers.
We were both settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no power in the sanatorium.
Our second group of migration representatives said that you can use the maximum half a week here, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an internal carrier who voted to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozira (approximately 50 kilometers [50 km] from the Ukrainian border - UP), we saw the launch of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first comes out, it shines beautifully, and then it goes off.
People sitting on a bus in Mozira reported that the Russians were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break a son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is not at all believed.
They say, "You are the one who fights, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their sites are used for weapons in Ukraine.
There were friends waiting for us to take us to Estonia.
Now we're going to register, decide what we're going to do.
In Estonia the Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as much as Estonian."
Marina lived in the territory of the military town of Hostomella along with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary items and documents.
In the evening, they went to the basement of the neighbor’s house.
Marina herself was unable to return home, and in principle she could not — there is no home.
No one knew so much about the evacuation.
And on Monday, you can't stay in the center?
Thank you, we've got everything. And we've always been waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, the motels are nice
And in this little apartment, there's no wifai hunting, basically all of your questions I answer, and now I don't know how to be? And children from Monday's online work, and there's no Internet.

Can you agree on how best to do this?
On April 1, Butchi Anatolio Fedoruk, the head of the city, announced the happy news that on March 31st, the Ukrainian military freed the city from Russian predators.
The next day, the occupations were thrown out of the entire Kiev area.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians were supposed to feel at that time was overshadowed by fear and hatred, since at the same time, it was known that at least 280 civilians had been shot by the Russians in one battle.
They were just killed on the street, some were tied to their hands and shot in the armpit, some of those killed were minors.
As a result of torture, they found the old village of Motijin Olga Suhenko, her husband Igora, and Alexander’s son, stolen on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a brotherly grave, Igoria, in sewerage.
The 20 - mile [20 km] route from Kiev revealed the bodies of several women dressed in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, there'll be no one.
I ordered a shipment from Germany using DHL.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday, but no one contacted me and no mail was delivered, and the DHL site said the recipient could not be found.

Good morning, I was just offered a vacation to a dentist in Prague, so thank you very much for your concern and I'm sorry.
It is very insignificant and somewhat irresponsible.
And if it stops, the phone will forget, or if it doesn't take the phone right now, and she didn't write to me what was in school and what was all right :)
And I'm worried about her because she's still not at home, but in another, not quite a known state.
I hope I found the math right.
You didn't think I was a child.
And the work is of course interesting.
But if I'm not physically good, because I don't have such a good physical shape.
You could pay for the apartment at reasonable prices if someone gave me the room.
You're getting along a lot, maybe you'll know someone.

Good morning, I'm talking to you about learning Czech, and I can't get rid of the news.
I often communicate with you, and I think you hear my thoughts.
President Vladimir Zelenski said that certain weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
That's what he said in an interview with the Associated Press, published by the President's Office, says "European Truth."
"All equipment, all they're already sending, for some kinds of equipment it's done late.
So what, for example, when we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," said Zelenski.
The president said, "No, no, no, no, no.
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would look different.
"She would have opened up otherwise, we would have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war anyway," he added.
Remember, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine a new military aid, which includes weapons and weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I'm going home.
Write me everything I need, please.
I wanted to ask you maybe you know where we got the blender in the kitchen.
Destructive actions in the form of faecal and disinformation are designed to provoke panic and disorganization that are sensitive to public security.

We've been following this address to ask for something to go to school. Maybe we didn't get there.
And the mother's prayer is the most rural.
I hear a lot of war on 10% of Ukraine's territory.
Why do people run?
Why don't they live in a territory where there's no war?
Are you crazy?
You lived in a war state?
When prices went up 100-200%.
When most businesses don't work.
When there's nowhere to earn.
When do children hear WFP?
Did you live like this?
You don't even have any ideas.
And give God not to have.
If you find out, it'll be JAHA.

If I understand the director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work in a few days for as many hours as I can get.
If that's the case, then I'll be able to go to work for a few days a week.
For as many hours as I can and as many days as I can see how to get out of my house so that I can go fashion and clean up the apartments, they pay more for cleaning, so they don't want to give up that job.
I'm a water supply tech, so I feel the splash of water right now.

He was a very rich man, and after a while he called and reported that he had had a heart surgery.
He just asked me to talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that I might be his toy and that I might need his money.
And then he made me a proposal.
"I had a car standing in the yard, a crocodile looked like it, and let the chests go.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, breathing was nothing.
And as for the apartment, you took the photo.
I haven't really come in there yet.

All right, he'll come over and get them.
I'm not hungry for anything.
I understand that I can't sit with you. I need to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and Ukrainian television at all.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1+1 is a presidential, propaganda channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police and fast came?

Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a photo.

"I'm telling her that the TV and the receiver's "refurbishment" has been delayed by importing details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to touch the door when they call."
"We've been hiding information about war all month.
That's what's going on.
However, the Flemish (UP) on the hips and back legs fell sharply — it could be stress, eating changes, and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and the stress is not up to me, unfortunately.
The flame, unlike the lightning, is not deaf, it hears both the sirens and the explosions."
Because Olga feels bad and spends most of her time in her room, her bride-in-law lived in her apartment with her "incognito."
And on April 1, 93, Oxana Polov took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days as a partisan, I lived with her in the apartment.
The war was also hidden from her, and what was next to me came as formally as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a reception, she listened for four hours, and then she sang for two hours."
The receiver was always by the bed.
Most of the time, the mother - in - law spends her room.
She doesn't feel bad, but it allowed me to be unbeknownst to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I was hiding in my room.
First, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
And then she called everyone who was in contact with her, and they're 6-7 people.
She asked her to talk to her about anything, not just about war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It's April 17th -- I've got 2 apartments cleaning :)

A British man who defended Mariupol in U.S.L.L.A. says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier who is a military officer of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Marine Brigade, who participates in Mariupola’s defense, told his friends and family that they were building a weapon and going into captivity to Russian occupations.
Source: twitter page Eidin Eislin, British who has been serving in U.S. labs since 2018, VVS with reference to family members and friends Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of the friend Eislin who spoke to him
Literally twitter Aislin: "We got a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to take prisoners to the Russian forces.
We did not have food and ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon end."
Details: Esslyn served in the 36th U.S. Navy Marine Brigade, which took part in Mariupola's defence operation.
The V.V.S. journalists contacted the mother of military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her on the phone that they were planning to go into captivity.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last phone call, Eislin said about the plans of their capitalization branch.
According to him, the brigades had ended with ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Aislin sub-division is about to go into captivity to the Russian sub-divisions so that they don't get through without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "cadriers."
Also, on social networks, there was an audio recording of a telephone conversation that seems to be talking to a well - known American friend who is planning to go to Ukraine.
Assline said that they were trying to get out of town in civilian clothing, but they failed.
Earlier, a British man told him that he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner in Instagram.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he joined the fight against terrorists called the Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the U.S.A. and made an oath.
Essly's friends and close friends were called Johnny, and he's more known for his sorceress than Cossack Gundi.

A brother in Mariupoli, another in Zaporizia, and a man from Kiev today moved to Harkov.
They call every day saying everything's okay, and there's someone who knows it, they won't tell the truth anyway.
She wanted to come to you, but she wanted to take care of some things.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, and I would like to have contact with Daniel.
Major attackers for their losses in the fight played full.
He was shot by the teacher Dmitr Pavlicko, his unknown relative, the young man Boris Oleksińk.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep washroom that had been laid on the ground. ”
“ There was some silence in the city. ”
Often, one of the residents ran from house to house.
In the streets, the bodies of the matriarchs always met

I am not afraid to work, just as I lived in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which has the name "Possible threat monitoring of Ukraine's national security in the field of economics."
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has been... the place where members of the board of supervisors of state and state meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of the state-owned Kieva may somehow solve the problems of Ukraine’s national security.
We know a large number of new threats to holding companies, but we still don't know about any company that needs to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law has been understood to be an excellent basis for "relieving" all acquisitions in the difficult reform of enterprises after the Revolution of Goodness, including independent supervisory councils, and then setting up a manual management.
Which was until 2015.
Why and who should enter the supervisory board of the companies?
What is more, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill is "flying" tomorrow, others can fly -- for example, the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NGO.
There's a lot to write about in the war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and Bill 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was introduced into a comparative table of Bill 5397.
In general, the desire to ignore the supervisory board in some way has been in circulation among some national defenders for a long time.
Instead of criticizing him, in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will find out the arguments that explained the need for his adoption.
And then we'll give our suggestions on how to deal with the issue of managing state enterprises during the war.
The prime minister of the economy, Dennis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication that would make it impossible to work away from the supervisory board.
In other words, the risk is that the Supervisory Board is unable to make the necessary decisions in relation to what could be paralyzed by the company's work.
Do we agree that such a risk exists, but can it prevent him from moving overseers to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a fairly cynical situation when independent members of the board of supervisors, who make up the majority of the members of the board, put their personal safety above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, they may be released under the bill.
And then, more quickly, this will lead to the loss of the quorum needed by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, the appointment of new independent members of the Supervisory Board will not succeed quickly, as the law provides for a competitive selection that takes an average of 3-4 months.
Hence, the proposed 717 decision - making plan could soon not save you from losing your decision - making capacity by the supervisory board, and it would rather result in that!
National MP, author of Dmitro Nataluh's bill, gives other arguments to support it.
In particular, he notes: "Many enterprises, such as the Defence and Industrial Complex (OPC), now need relocations" and therefore "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from the Zoo."
For the first time, there are almost no OPC companies in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is in the Ucrobundprom, which essentially manages almost all OPC companies.
But even in the Ucrobundprom, according to the law, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties on a non-free basis.
The entire authority in the Ukrobourmi belongs to the Director-General, who will decide on the need for a relocation of the OPC company that is part of the group.
Moreover, such an argument does not withstand criticism even because Bill 7176 does not at all make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPC enterprises.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be referred to the category of emotions.
Such arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state companies and state banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "respective foreign experts in the first word "war" are still leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory board in state enterprises in Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand fines, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
Firstly, this manipulation is the majority of such supervisory council members who have never lived in Ukraine and who have only come here periodically.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, in a soft, unfair way.
Secondly, as a result of the crown virus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisors have long been able to conduct online meetings.
This tool has long been widely used in world practice, and in a wide range of areas: business, education, medicine, and so on.
It should also not be forgotten that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
Usually, these people have a different kind of activity, and just the electronic communications tools help them in this.
Third, all of these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the Board of Supervisors who are Ukrainians?
Because they too are not located where their companies are located.
In short, it is not the first popular attempt to remove foreigners from the supervisory board, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
I'm in Ukraine, looking for possible alternatives to temporary family shelter, with two children with me.

We usually need a passport from one of the adults.
In the brewer's, the Highland, and the Buchanic areas of Kiev, which were released from occupations, a strong commandant hour will be introduced for 2 periods.
Directly speaking, "In the occupied areas of Bravarsky, Višgorodski and Buchanic areas that were under Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commandant hour is increased!
In the territory of these cities and the limits will operate from 21:00 on 2 April to 06:00 on 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the bulwark, it is now categorically forbidden to be on the streets and in other public places, to travel by road, and to walk.
People can only go out in the street when they are alarmed to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the effects of Russian aggression — to clean and exchange territories.
The omelaneum called on people who had left the area to stay away from their home.
In the rest of Kiev, the commandant hour will last from 21:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

Lukashenko's troops have held three 27 and 28-year-olds who are involved in the destruction of two relay valves of the Osipovica signal system, which ensures the movement of railways.
Source: Radio Freeboda, Vashna Human Rights Centre, Head of the IMS Criminal Police Gennadia Kazakevic, quoted by the Belta Intelligence Agency.
On March 30, Belarus was reported to have detained three inhabitants of Bobroujska, one injured in force in support of the SOBR.
According to the Springs, when the men were detained, they did an active resistance and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and was in a medical facility.
Others were given medical help in the area.
The head of the IMS police, Belarus, said that "acts of terrorism on the RB's railway will be stopped severely" by the use of weapons.
On April 6th, it was reported that on March 30th, the police detained another member of the Belarusian Railways, a member of the Baranovich Department of the BJD and the managing director of the BJD's thematic resources in the WContact and Unclassified Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, he reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railways were held in Belarus for entertainment.
Remember: BYPOL's formation, declared by Lukashenko's extremist regime, continues to call on Belarusians to diversify the railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the Peremoga Plan.
Belarus's Reek Party is thus trying to resist the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, Belarus's RF is moving to war, in Ukraine, living power and technology.

U.S.A. bans investments in RF and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, imposes new sanctions on the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Serbia, as well as ban all new investments in Russia.
The report on this subject is on the White House’s website.
The bank is Russia's largest financial institution owned by the government and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the RF.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Byden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
"This step is based on an approved decision of over 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, and other service providers such as legal and consulting companies," says the White House.
A third step in the United States’s new sanctions was the restriction against the large Russian state enterprises in the critical area.
This will prevent U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and will freeze any assets they have in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfins will be published on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the full blocking of the assets of the adult children Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Council of Security of Russia, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mistin
The sanctions shut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

I'll take care of myself.
I'm a little hard, but I understand that I have to go through this stage.
I'll see you Thursday and tell you everything.
It's all right.
I play how often you clean up
I clean every week.
I'm sorry, I don't have a program, but I'm gonna try and figure it out.
I dreamed of being a teacher.
My girls can't go anywhere right now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you to let me know if you heard about the housing information.
I would gladly rent a house with a good girl.
If you may know, let me know.
On my own, I'm not going to let go.
Thank you very much.
I didn't write you another Natal 54 year old. Please write the exact address and the price of the courses.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it was one of my births:)
I'm sorry I didn't see you.
We're going to the medical committee now.
I mean, we're not supposed to be working this hour the other day.
What day would it be better for her to come early? (What day might she have a little more work?)
I hear tomorrow, the Internet is working bad.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you.. they found something from things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both of the beginners, except for the abbots, we don't know anything.
Nothing's going on.
Is it possible on Monday 25.04?
You can take the kid with you, the toy here is enough :)
I thought about my dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll figure something out with this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But how will this be paid, please, no credit.
Write me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should you take the clothes they gave you?
It's not my day. It's broken in the living room. One morning.
Something's come from you, I don't see what
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the bill later.
Do you only have a dad who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning, and how many houses do he have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'd like to read Joe Dispense, he's doing research on the effects of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
TV station journalist "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released her video this morning on April 12th, which she was handed over to the military 36th Marine Corps from Mariupol.
It tells the military that they had no weapons left to take part in battle and the plague of the wounded.
They said, "The bill's coming in an hour."
Earlier, on 11 April, a separate seabed brigade, which took part in Mariupola's defense, published a Russian address to the Ukrainians.
It was reported that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupola's defenders, and Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
Skeptics expressed their suspicion that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerius, has assured us that the relationship with the Armed Forces in Mariupoli is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public debate.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azostal factory in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupations dropped the toxic substance of unknown origin to Mariupoli.
According to the leader of Azova, Andry Billetsky, the RF army used a chemical weapon against the Azostal plant, which keeps the battles of Colonel Azov.
Thank you, I'm going to fall under you.
The situation is the same while we're here.
( 2 hours driving)) Walks, moms in shops and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The squadron of the Czech drones has been flying over Ukraine since today.
Nearly 50 professional copyists will serve to detect and separate them for the direct destruction of the enemy predator.
Two Zakarpats and two Czech “birds ” were sent to Ukraine in the evening thanks to the deputy of the Mukachev town of Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their intercity friends led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplethere101/Vasill Sturum delivered drones for the purpose of receiving special units of the Ukrainian army in various cities where fighting is taking place.
With the aim of making the most effective and safe use of Copters, we will now remain in secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say that many more interesting “gifts” will be sent to Ukraine as soon as possible, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupation and preserve the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, it's all right.
I'm worried we're not gonna make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine soon, and I'm going to work.
If it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there was no one living.
Maybe she'll be betrayed and moody.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still on the street today.
She drank drugs and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I’m sorry, too, but it’s better to meet when I’m healthy.
When you have time, take off the music you like.
I wonder what your musical achievements are.
Mom and Dad Should Obey
You'll find him around your little brother's wheel.
Today there was colder and rain, and tomorrow must be warmer.
But it's not bad for broken houses, it's bad for people who are being abused by the occupants.
In Herson, the occupants were known as the Slava Ukraine Memorial in Herson on the street of Prekopski.
Details: It is noted that the unknown broke the flag of the European Union, smashed the panels with photographs of the celestial hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupying forces destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the hundreds of Heaven and the deceased participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Take off the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the kids for the Christmas, we don't have that habit, so we didn't know, gave the kids only chocolate and cake, maybe something else needed to be given.
In Czech, there is someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live a guy in a gang before twelve people are here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
He was already in the shed today.
Even today he's been sleeping there.
That's why we're making great progress.
I'll have to bring the walnuts together!
I don't have the strength to do it for a minute.
Since I've been pushing away from the days and times when there's a job cleaning after guests, I can say about April for a month, because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
In May, I can say about the end of April or at the beginning of May.
She just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been writing down dinner and sleeping for a while.
If you don't mind, can I come today?)
Or I'll see you after your arrival)
He's a modest man, and he's been learning a lot lately.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people in such a high position.
Today, I have a lesson from a lady who is the head of the department of economics on the edge of the height.
She was very pleased with my work.
I was wrong about the lights.
On Monday, I'm going to have to get confirmation of my work arrangements as well as a paycheck.
I'm soaring from Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot of them and I sleep (and I drink a lot of water)
If you go to your doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you if you can.
I've got one more analysis to bring.
You don't have to go again.
There's a lot of bad work on the sink, there's a lot of washing, there's a lot of work to do.
That's enough.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you've signed up for.
And do children eat there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can get in there is one question
If You Need Help, Write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
At first, we didn't really want you to raise money so people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling I didn't have two points:
I'm going to lie down. I'm going to get my energy and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
Now I'm going to look at the video, and it's going to be good, because the whole family is going to draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
For more information, please contact the Treasurer’s Office by writing to the address noted above.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
Took a couple of pieces for the wallet.
After the festival, the Internet is to be held.
I'd like to be your spare designer.
How do you think the day I wasn't at work is a pass?
Staffing: Russia prepares a provocation in Prednistro to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may be indicted in the Prednistrov region of Moldova to charge Ukraine with "aggression against the neighbouring state".
In other words, "The Russian Federation's military forces are not excluding provocative actions in the territory of the Prednistrov region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to build an intrusive group of armies for action in the Slovene direction.
In the near future, the occupants will likely try to reinvigorate the scene.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personal supplies, weapons, and techniques for participation in combat activities in the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military technology are being prepared at the site of the 60th permanent location of the single gunfighting brigade (Monistrist) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that the weapons listed will be moved to the temporary occupied territory of the Donetsk area.
Also, to restore the personal composition of the battalion tactical divisions of the 36th individual Shore Brigade (Borza, Zabaykalsky Land) of the 29 General Army of the Eastern Military District, a set of military personnel of the designated Brigade is being carried out.
The enemy's particular problem is to complete the positions of drivers and drivers.
The event of the selected personal component from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably the opponent to disrupt the supply of cargo to the battlefield will continue to hit the transport infrastructure sites in Ukraine with a view to destroying them or getting them out of the system.
The military sub-divisions of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilor border in the Brescia and Gomela areas.
In the Slovene direction, the divisions of the 6th Civilian Army and the coastal armies of the North Fleet continue to block the city of Harkov, and the artillery fires take place in different areas of the city.
In the Islamic direction, there is an air exploration of the area with a view to identifying the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
To that end, the opponent uses BPLA Orlan-10.
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an attack on the settlements of Dungenke and Dmitrovka, and he failed and went to a previously occupied position.
In the Donetsk direction, the opponent continues to focus on the occupations under the control of the populous sites Save, Rubijn, Lower, and Novobakhmutuk, as well as the establishment of full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to take violent action in the Golden region, and he had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue to operate in the areas of the Azostal plant and the seaport.
The forces of the enemy sub-divisions carried out artillery firefights in the Ukrainian army in the areas of the inhabited Highlands, Trudolovka and Marianska.
In the area of Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukraine's defenders have seen four enemy attacks in the past, five tanks, eight armed units, six vehicle units and eight artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
Of course we're trying to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep and I'll hold you back?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I get it.)
We didn't even watch TV at home, so we didn't have to set up any more than 1 + 1 :)
I'm going to turn on the TV here just to listen to the Czech language.
I have a monthly tariff package to finish today :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for hanging, canvas, thread for hanging
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I'm asking her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much pies.
I'll see my father later, of course.
I read the post on the Facebook, and maybe Google wrote something of my own, and I think phone numbers are enough.
Good day, we've got the things you brought, but are there things we can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about it.
If you arrange for me, I can start working from next week, because I plan to go to the office by noon to deliver documents (if possible, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
I'm looking for a brigade at first, I love chemistry at school, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, I'm dreaming to work on Teva.
Friends of the past and not of the past, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends of the spirit and mind.
Now you too have faced difficult times.
During the past month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy without it, has turned from one foot to another, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have been admitted to feeling guilty and ashamed of your country’s actions regarding your neighbors.
Because they submit Ukraine on your behalf.
Over some of you, activists, have long written a threat, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very long-standing friend from the Memorial.
Let's talk about it a little later, as usual, Sasha answered nicely.
Others, such as culture, artists, critics, and writers, are impressed by the sudden collapse of your little world.
None of you like Putin and his regime thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be open: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the "Memorials", the "New Newspaper", the "Eho Moscow," the "Meduz," the "Oval" organization and in a number of other places -- do many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for participation in the meetings when they were still taking place.
Also read the column of the Russian journalist "Lostly Hide, Late Silence"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy, and your passive compatriots, who are now, surely, a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In 1990, there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy -- a disorderly even curve, but a real one.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally surrounded by such a strong fear of grief that you are looking for salvation behind the King's back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
How many people he didn't kill, you still think he was safer.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the CDB archives, as did the Germans from the stasis, you took a soul to the Dzerjinsk Memorial and allowed the CDB to lie on the ground, to update, transform, and seize power over the country.
When you were put before the choice between the robbery of the country and the return of the communists, you did not begin to fight for the possibility of the third option – and you were humbly reconciled to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass meetings for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Surviving was a major concern.
Then Putin showed up, young, entrepreneurship, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you have bought it, but you have voted for it, or you have preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya again with the earth, most of you closed your eyes on it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya, helping the victims of the travel "anti-terrorist operation," and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Horrible, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging with you, my friends.
We were drinking, dancing, and sometimes I was trying to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of peaceful people, the killings of children, the soldiers who sold bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bred, we're sick of your Chechen." I remember those words very well.
And I was like, "Friends, it's not my Chechnya, it's your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
It's your authority that bombes one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then there's an economic rise in the average of zeros, combined with rising oil prices, and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the money stolen is left in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - off, some have become rich, and even the poorest among you have acquired a new home and found a better job.
The prices have grown, and is it a disaster?
Moscow was shining and licking from the neck.
When several opposers — Juria Škoczyhina, Anna Politkovska, Aleksandra Litvinenka, and others — were killed, many of you were shocked and terrified about what had happened.
However, the matter did not continue.
When, after two terms, Putin passed the post of President Medveyev, and he himself took the prime minister's seat, you, as I can see, barely noticed.
When, a few months later, the government of Medvey, Russia, intertwined in Georgia, most of you ignored or kept quiet.
How many of you have I met in the next few years on the mountain slopes of Godauri, in the mountains of Kazbea or in the cafe and in the Turkish spas of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that there's hardly much we've done in the West if we've done anything at all.
A bit of resentment, a bit of sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again changed places with Medvey and the president's seat, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you were mass protesting.
The name of Valais became famous, you didn't leave the street for half a year, and the regime finally felt terrible that it was losing ground under its feet.
Then he struck the answer.
Alternative actions were first organized, more repressive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands have been found behind bars.
Some were given huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look what they did two years ago.
Angry by the Persian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once seized Medan — and never left him.
They set up the tent on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves by using Molotov’s thumbs, guns, and cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
Instead of running away, however, the protesters turned to attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Janukovich, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose the leaders themselves and expel them if they did not do their business well.
Maiden didn't like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
So when he took advantage of the general confusion, he took Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits are few.
How many of you have been caught!
As far as I know, 91 percent of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From there a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his joke all of a sudden came back to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I find it hard to find a reason because immediately after that, we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
"We don't care about politics," you said.
And you were hiding new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration that Moscow started in 2012, with their binbegs, the common wifa and the hipster coffee.
Indeed, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You barely noticed Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
Even the Moscow editor, who released my book on Syria, then criticized it in an interview, because I didn't really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting my children in cold blood.
Of all Russian citizens, only your soldiers were there, who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
"First they came for socialists, but I spoke, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to pick up the trade union members, but I spoke because I was not a trade union member.
Then they came to the Jews, but I spoke to them because I was not a Jew.
Then they came after me, but there's no one left to say anything about my protection."
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the majority of them were silent.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitro Glukhovski, Mikhailo Shishkin, Mikhailo Zigar, Max Osipov, and others.
Most people allow themselves to speak abroad, some from the middle of the country, such as Marina Ovanznikov, risking getting into a new GULAG or setting up a Nawala company.
As far as others are concerned, you know the country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand, when Putin deals with the Ukrainians -- or what seems very likely if he doesn't make it -- he'll marry you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but mostly alone, have come out to protest and have yet to take a small step, but soon they will get more serious.
For a thousand of you, who signed a petition, who made a disagreement in social networks (even a black square in Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation were given simply for the anecdotes were not so far past — and now they are likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you?
An example of Ukrainians – even more than 2014 – is a fear of travel: they prove that they can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage may be.
In view of all this, few in Russia realize this as well as what the war is going on.
But you, my friends, well know what's going on right now.
You're reading foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in contact with.
And Putin knows you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence is over.
Your choices are just hohma, your laws, if you don't take into account the repressive ones, they don't cost more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is gone, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you don't have any credit cards to buy a ticket to a plane abroad, even if some travels are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your agreement, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go or get disappointed.
I doubt you'll see another option.
And yet there's another one.
Which eventually breaks this regime.
And maybe in the circumstances you're in, you'll need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark won't scare you: because of the economic collapse of Russia, it'll most likely burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly and wages are not paid, people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out in the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, my friends.
But if each city goes out at meetings itself, as it has often done, it will not be hard for him to suppress them alone.
Organisation and coordination will be required. The crowd will have to be converted to mass.
You have this great magic tool -- the Internet, which can limit the mode, but which is still working and which can be adjusted under almost any circumstances.
The Valais organization was demolished, but others could be created, more informally, more decentralized.
You're a lot, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it's more than 300 grand, it's going to be a shock.
An army will have to be used, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After everything he had forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he had them to do?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a sense of dread; those who have children will be afraid of them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid of you, too.
For example, in Syria and now in Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who tend to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but who really try to obtain it.
But even if you do not do anything, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son's going to throw a joke into a computer game -- and he's going to be arrested -- and your daughter's going to be angry with the Internet -- and he's going to be arrested; your close friend's going to make mistakes -- and he's going to die in a raw cell under police dunes.
This is what has been happening for many years — and it will continue to grow in scope and scale.
So you don't have a choice.
Be cool, think strategically, and make this happen.
We were on Friday, we were told we could come by Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
What You Accept as the Secretary's Press
age, how often do you go to dinner at a expensive restaurant?
I'm going to dinner at the expensive restaurant once in a while.
I'll try to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very well and we wanted something brighter, so it's a better option.
She was in a room with a lot of people, tired of energy.
I feel sick, coughing, fever, voice loss, weakness and headaches.
I have to go to that government for work.
We've already done this, but we said who registered in April received the money only at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, we go with our children to the doctor.
But at night I wrote a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm expecting new news from her, and I'm going to have to report.
Working at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a lot of damage to the lost time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I’m communicable, but I’m serious about marriage.
There was one man for whom I had to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that to create a family people must love, respect, trust each other.
Right now, I haven't met.
Good morning. Where can you get the forms in the Head for the sand (paper or silicone)?
All right, thanks for the advice. I'll be in the Vale witness poll right now.
She's got a DCP in her bed, she's got a leg broken in her hips, a wheelchair in her bed, the food's all over in the blender.
Mr. Reichhard, I'm sorry to bother you at some point.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into the game room to Natalie today, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child away because she said that she had come to look at the things and to have them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our baby room to her by 7:00 last night.
Can that really be?
It's time to go to the room by 4:00.
And finally, it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load opening a very weak Internet page.
Well, we're all fine. The wheel works, the invitations were filled yesterday, and I was doing with the seniors before the high school exam.
The most difficult to understand is the task of geometry.
On Saturday, Vladimir helped us.
Age studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
How grateful we are for the housing!
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We're going to do our best to collect the sum by the end of the week to figure it out.
The situation regarding Russian invasion is briefing the head of the Office of President Oleksi Arestovich (10.04.2022)
The head of the President's Office's council told of the heroic act of a senior military officer in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he broke himself off with the radio station so that she wouldn't get to the opponent.
I have a very important question to ask if it will help me to put my grandson in charge of her 5 years (bronchial asthma) now in her stomach and flu...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little bit of Ukrainian or Russian.
We need urgent advice from a doctor who is very concerned about her condition.
We live in the Czech Republic Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor who's around here in Dolní Chabry or somewhere near possible Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The metal show was very popular.
Butterflies sat on their hands and on their feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, I'm so grateful, I'm not saying anything, thank you very much.
Mom's been standing there since 4 a.m.
Perhaps the master will leave his phone for communication.
I still think it's the best option for this house in Prague-8.
The director did not tell me about the possibility of sponsoring the children’s lunches.
I've been given such data to pay.
By March and April, I had already paid for food.
If you had the opportunity to help me pay for May and June?
What do I have to do?
Ask the principal of the school with this question?
Going on Mondays or coming in the middle?,!
All your friends will know you're associating with me.
