Members of the Wells People's Assembly are concerned that "they look like maps"
Some of the members of the congregation are amazed at the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that it may be the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party Congregation said his party was concerned that "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: on Welsh Twp it means "stupid/crazy", and pwp it means "how".
A member of Plaid said the party was "not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "free" for the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "map" (Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire-English excuse of the letter "u".
The Commission of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision for any words to be named by members of the congregation will, of course, bring the members themselves."
Wells' 2017 government law empowered Wells' congregation to change its name.
In June, the committee announced the results of the public consultation on proposals that indicated great support for appointing the congregation as a Welski Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP has received the largest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus can cause headaches for the Assembly President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill for changes within weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and constantly opposed the country's EU and NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name-change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's call was silenced as churches in Harlem faced problems
"Historic, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's no one else."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he said.
"Baroves are no longer living rooms in the villages where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people buying apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that's why the day these churches will be closed completely is not likely to become members of these churches for the majority of people moving in those apartments."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem to become a metropolis of the Blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th Street vendors, the main market street in Harlem, who refused to hire or upgrade blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson’s parishioners had plans to rebuild it, they bought the caravan.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the caravan "the bell of the poor."
The expert who played the carilon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that it is the first carilon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the largest carilon in the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveter said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, brought by the unaccompanied leaders of the church, and part of the Episcopal Epicurean.
The Church Committee – the church's governing body, composed of unaccompanied leaders – writes to the eparchy in July with concern that the eparchy "will seek to transfer the expenses" of the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the eparchy.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency by the parishioner.
Sharks hurt a 13-year-old kid when diving for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while a lobster kidney in California on the opening day of the lobster season, the authorities said.
The attack happened something 7 hours ago near Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he would dive with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then hang out to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said that he first thought it was an excitement to catch a lobster, but then “he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
He's late!"
He was looking at the whole key bone," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I used to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, he was found in critical condition.
We don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told the press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided that the shark was not of a dangerous nature.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the beach on the beach of Pontho in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Gils noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most do not consider themselves dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are entering the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of goods houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant market for beauty in the UK that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sector fall, large beauty rafts will be tested in 11 shops around the country, and will be presented in more shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty appeared after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space of the rafts that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the supply of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brandy areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of Boutique makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vaginas, which is increasingly required by younger consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Creedon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food at a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like commodity houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began to put Argos's shops in hundreds of shops, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which they considered increased the sales of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganise its beauty and pharmaceutical departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreeing on how to divide the profits from the chemical stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was told to play a part in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty rafts to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our brand series is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "sats" after Holly Willowby withdraws from a contract worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den went "infuriated" after TV director Holly Willowby withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his brand-new life-style business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their brand True for products and household supplements.
The two's business is connected to the Goop brand in Guineat Paltrow.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program told Instagram he's leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retreating from their profitable, brand-new lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "infuriated" when a television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday in the seat of his business empire in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to £1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to devote to their brand True for products and household supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Guillett Paltrow and was said to double Willowby's wealth of 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones soon left Britain in one of his weekends.
One source states: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw from all those affected caught them utterly unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's headquarters there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning's programme guide, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, can cost the company millions because of large investments in laundry and candles products, as well as clothing and household products, and because of the potential for further postponement.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share of the Boldwin TV production company.
Willouby should become an ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlyn as the leader of "I'm A Celebrity" (I'm the star) on ITV.
Source near Jones yesterday said "We are not commenting on his business ventures".
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting that some would consider him "unpresiding" and because he is so positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice translated as "the representative of the news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearisation in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders of the UN's Main Assembly that the North does not see "a proper response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea for disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the meeting.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We were supposed to be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results – he finished the rocket tests, helped free hostages, and the remaining American soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, there was no elemental accident, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although the “Save the Children ” consists of traveling to Palau, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperate for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other shores.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu, though a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims has turned to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and roads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the reelections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using swords, spears, and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge of the Liverpool team at once against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Prime Minister's 89-minute goal league in Stamford Bridge, London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Starize's ball to about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1 – 0.
He moved the ball to the left before he turned it to the distant statue.
The ball moved high above the hexagon as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumpy Keppa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting close and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea took 1 – 0 in half the time after the Belgian star One Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The "floor attacker" turned fifth back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before throwing the ball almost to half the field, and then sprinted into the middle of Liverpool.
They quickly joined Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed the missile, leading Hazard to the 16th century.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up in the network of the remote station with a left-legged shot next to Alison Becker in Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight with Naples in the team phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. in the middle of the San Paolo stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA League Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5-inch earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of 20-inch height, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was ravaged by a coup d'état from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was beaten to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 with Grayson Moves' stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also want to ask people, especially the taxi drivers, who may have taken pictures of the cameras from the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesperson that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and, as the police have said, they will inform the victim's immediate people.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moves just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him he wasn't allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were now told that it would be hours before they could return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene.
She keeps repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2.00 p.m., two police vans were in the border, and another one was outside.
Several policemen were standing in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111, quoting entry 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell's statue has become the latest memory blow in the framework of "rewrite history"
Her persecution would be a poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The English civil war iconoclast was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the works of his forefather, Thomas, in the past century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th - century thinking and of some of the figures that many believe are still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation is the subject of a continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord-protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
A pig-killer split up and killed a Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked and killed a market farmer in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name of "Juan", was found dead with the skin artery, covered in blood near the market stall in Liupanshui in the province of Gicou, South China, said Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the nearby pighouse.
He declared that there was a huge blood clot in the hip.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the burden of 550 pounds broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's foot was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Wu," according to the quote in Guyang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager said about the evening news that the pigs were locked up to prevent attacks on other people while the police gathered evidence on the spot.
John's family and market leaders allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, there have been cases of pigs that have attacked humans in the past.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650 - pound - a - pound - a - foot - a - foot - a - wall farmer was nailed to his tractor until his wife threw the animal out.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves across the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rainwater to the north of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a storm of category 1 from 5.00 east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenía, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to develop over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday, as a tropical storm will begin to introduce large tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropics with the approaching depression will produce abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, torrents of ruins, and possible landslides in the desert.
The great tropical moisture will cause rains that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches an hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible because of the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended that you do not go to the desert footpaths with the possibility of tropical rain.
Several rains may cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and stormy weather will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local torrential rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Possible rains are more than half an inch [2.5 m] in total, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Temporary tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rain is extended later on Monday and Tuesday.
Several rains will be extended in the "four eagles" on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the Arctic's cooling, but tropical areas remain high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees the difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Mon, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the southeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast points to the possibility of average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual attack in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the inexhaustible political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular programmes for the coup last Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, concluded an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the senate's court committee that 100 percent were sure that Kavano had taken her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavano, in his passionate witnessing, said 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen said, saw it on Friday.
The company counted average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who look at offices.
To make it look better, it's a public with a size similar to a football game or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavano's appointment, led all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day's hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After a moderate announcement by the Republican office that he would vote for Kavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught as protestors called him Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for hearing the court committee.
He was standing with his eyes depressed for a few minutes while he was being beaten, and all of that was transmitted live to CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think it tells the truth of the earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later, when the court committee should have voted to advance Kavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was very important, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Cavano without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May Indicts Critics for "Playing Politics" About the Coast
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right up to her home page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect loan costs is "totally absurd".
Shooting at Wade Sims: Police arrested suspect Deion Simson for the death of a sportsman at the State University of Louisiana
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims' fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Deiton Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder, Baton Rose Police Department said.
Authorities posted a video from a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner told CBS.
After being interrogated by Simpson, the police reported that he admitted to shooting Wade and killed him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the parish pathologist at the Eastern Baton Rose said a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The unit to thank the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the criminalist state police lab, the South University Police and the citizens of the area for the aid they provided in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Athletic Director at the State University of Louisiana thanked the police for her "activity in the search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6:6 foot bet grew in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the State University of Louisiana.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at the State University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Sims' death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," the coach said.
Volcano threw ashes on Mexico City
Throwing ashes from the volcano Popotapetl reached the southern populated areas of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after starting activity on the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered for 24 hours.
The center was followed by more tattoos and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in the populated parts of Mexico City, such as Socimillko.
Gephysicists noted an increased activity on the 45-mile (72km) volcano south-east of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protestors met with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined the rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the separation of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into the right, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day they also beat the fights, and the police used their bats to beat the fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups called "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness", and union protestors called "Long to live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in protests, reports from the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the 1 October referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the exit was small because of the boycott by people who oppose separation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at the polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia has a chance to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having won a vital but close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders or in a self-elected persecution or imprisonment awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording a police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before last year's trial, announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: men arrested after car crashing into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after repeated car crashing into a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balinagarde Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage to the gate and the building itself was caused.
At one point, it could be shot from a self - shot to a car.
Menga's hit brought a 1 - 0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The advanced Livingston wrote the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to be significant as Gary Hold's country climbed to a level with a second-ranking Hibernian.
Gerard's country lost its victory in the season's championship and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind which they are left with eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe the League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continues to be invincible in the division during six matches, and Coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since Kenny Miller’s replacement last month.
Livingstone missed the chance against harsh guests
Holt's team was supposed to spend a long time before they gave the target, and their directness caused many Rangers problems.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the goal, and then Alan Littgow could only direct his efforts far away after he slipped the hit with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the actions set.
And that's exactly how the verdict came.
Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only gave a hit from the center of the sixteenth.
So far the Rangers have dominated the possession of the ball, but they couldn't break the home defense, so the giant Liam Kelly didn't play most of the time.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos performed a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score because of the ranger's skill, Alan McGregor, and Litgo took the ball away from another set of actions at Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen-year-old was constantly passing by and was constantly defended, while two penalty demands -- after Halkett's argument for Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand-playing -- were rejected.
Livingston's Phenomenal – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to surpass the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of play barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, running a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they've ever been under Gerard's leadership, they're now lagging behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the house – and it is a little awareness of the Rangers, who were found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colony
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan of Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They got worse because of problems involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurdi, also clarified, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protesters portray the visitor's division famous as the hero of some German Turks and criticised as autocrat by others.
Traffic accident on the road in Deptford: a bicycle driver died in a car crash
A biker died after a car crash in London.
The match took place near the Beeswood and Evelyn street crossroads, a heavy - metal vehicle in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and came to the emergency room, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place a few months after the death of another biker in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metro police said officials are working to identify the husband and inform his family.
Roadblocks are set up and buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six policemen injured in peace
Six prison policemen were injured in riots in a man's prison with a high level of security, said the prison's office.
Unrest broke out in HMP Long Martin in Worchester at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the disturbances, which include eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Cops are treated for minor injuries on the spot.
The prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and can spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of the hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, presenting a risk of sudden flooding.
The state meteorological station has already issued alerts for possible sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, as well as to south and east Nevada, Southeast California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Suite Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression of 200 miles [200 km] to Phoenix since 1950!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane of 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Centre for Hurricanes predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the work of Mongolia in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Carpest Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk areas for sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain will likely be beneficial because the southwest region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought tracking body, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has brought to earth’s dunes everywhere on the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still in stormy weather on Sunday mornings with winds of up to 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes into contact with cold water in the Pacific and is shrinking.
Therefore, rain is expected in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm at noon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
" rain is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border in early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and South Juta to late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains are the abundant rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the US desert southwest region," the State Centre for Hurricane Victims said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and torrents of ruins, as well as landslides in mountain regions.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excellence Terrace of Midsummer Norton about 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is in "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset's police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage of the case to step in.
Trump said Kavano "tolerated the biggest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voice for Judge Kavano is a voice to reject the most cruel and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavano "tolerated the biggest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blasi Ford that he had committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified to the hearing and her accusations.
The president said Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an irrevocably public service record," he said before a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavano's nomination as he spoke about the significance of the republicans' outcome of the early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I fight for great candidates."
Trump said the democrats have a mission to "resist and prevent".
The first key vote for the nomination of Kavano in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, GOP senior leader CNN said.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were taken away by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves 6 feet (18 m) high struck the shore of the sun, bringing many to safety and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 earthquake, it hit the tsunamis.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they didn't run away right away, so they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesman for disaster mediation in Indonesia in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climb a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photos published by the disaster agency showed a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, torn down and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the energy released from the Atomic Bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of the long, narrow shore, can be enhanced by the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "absolute" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the impact of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage can be increased along the 300km coast (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that tsunamis hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves came at about the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur picture shared in social media, a man can hear the top of a building, as it calls infatuated, warning people down the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water falls onto the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused power cuts that cut off communications around Pala, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated people desperately still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was opened again just for help and will remain closed by October.
President Yoko Vidodo was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltered in shelters of cedars in their officeyard, they went through desert scenes along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even while relief groups began dark attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign relief experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and staff abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"What the government will say, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can accept international assistance, but still not status".
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami struck in Palu on Friday, friends and families of missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewerage.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who was impaled under the shock for two days with her mother's body attached to her.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others who are stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how, when she began to broadcast news about the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel in the paragliding community, he was desperate to send messages to WhatsApp to the contestants from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray sign of sneezing, rather than with a son.
"I think that means that messages are not delivered," he said.
Stealers stole $26,750 when they filled the ATM at Newport on the Kayot.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who added a ATM to Newport's office, according to Newport's press statement.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the fun complex and prepared to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in his statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kane West has changed his name to Yah.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature was once known as Kanje West".
Forty - one year - old West wore her shirt for a while and used it for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his Saturday Night Live guest, where his new Yandhi album is expected to be released.
He will replace Ariana Grande's singer on the show that had to give up "emotive reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with Radio Director Big Boy.
"What means I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He left the land of Canaan, meaning the only one, only Jehovah, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of the many well - known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Dedy, Pi Didi, or Didi, but this year he published his favorite name Love and Brother Love (Love and Brother Love).
Former West co-worker Jay Zi also uses his name with or without drawings and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the army against the civilians
Mexico's CEO Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that he would "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number 1 in innovations for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Integrating the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Li said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a general director of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most outstanding companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 80s of the University of Carnegie Melon he worked on an artificial intelligence system that won the highest-ranking American hotel player, and was later director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Are you grateful for the previous US government technology competitions as the challenge in the Agency's robotics for advanced defence research projects and asked when it will be next, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that took academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think "green cards" should be offered automatically to science doctors for artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued its plan to develop the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and Other Government Organizations distributes money to US researchers, but the quality of the work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academies, and the White House announced the establishment of the Authority's Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for the initiative called "AI Next".
As far as NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of a National Commission for the Safety of artificial intelligence has not had any effect for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted on a referendum Sunday to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and veto its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign doubted whether the outcome would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for the referendum's validity.
The issue of the referendum tab said: "Have you joined NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that that price is worth paying to allow for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the European Union's umbrella because it means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Gorgievska in Skopje said.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission said there were no complaints of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the outcome stood at 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the past parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in Macedonia's referendum on the country's name change, which will pave the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come in with our heads raised high, not from the rear," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be "firm for our future".
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the required background.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Thelma, showed that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order to make the referendum successful, the exit should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government after they came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spent all of Brighton's defense for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling soon conquered Brighton's defense in the 2 – 0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker was given the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Bryton's defense players before entering the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greens.
He circled around a defense player before he ran several others to work on Brighton's sixteenth.
He then turned left of him to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat the Bryton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly Blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister's League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left-hand side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before taking Sterling to the remote station.
The "heavenly Blues" attack put the ball in the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the team of the Champions League in 12.55 on Tuesday in the Rain Nekar Arena, Germany.
Sugar wants to play Spoiler against Rockis
Since Nashnells were eliminated from the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But the competitive Sherzer always hopes to stand in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there is still a stakeout for the Rockis team, who are running a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rocky's team had at least a "joker" for a place with a 5 - 2 victory over Nesnells on Friday night, but they're still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
"Although we play for nothing, at least we can throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level any moment I'm facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nesnells still needs to publish a week - long starter, but he reportedly tends to let Sherzer fall into such a situation.
Sugar, who's going to start 34 times, was practicing a throw on Thursday, and she's gonna usually throw a break on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18 – 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-points in 220 2/3 in the season.
Tromp meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation about his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano as he spoke about the importance of the exit of the republicans of the early elections.
"All we've done so far will be put on a cube in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I don't run, but I really fight, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the resources available to them, you see evil, indecencies.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and prevent".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "angrily, wicked, dishonest and dishonest."
He mentioned Senator Diana Feynstein from the ranks of the democrats set up by the Senate's Judicial Committee, on behalf of which the public responded with calls for discontent.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you post the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I wait for a moment – it was a very bad speech on the body – the worst speech on the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
People who express their opinion are not tolerated
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the order of members of parliament from the laboratory party to which we have been told that we are not welcome – just because they express their opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar questions that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
An announcement for an Eastern Labor Party meeting in Notingam stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the Labour Party, the council meetings Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, it's not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "serious, gentle" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It becomes increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the laboratory party, and each opinion is judged as acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had shared a similar political opinion earlier began to expect me to change my mind completely and take positions that otherwise would never take them, whether it was national security or the EU's internal security.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn't matter what I'm going to say, there's a critical abuse of the social media calling for conviction, denial of the central politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this kind of experience.
Actually, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed towards me are usually political.
I have great reverence for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the level of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the laboratory party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "lack of confidence" or for a change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrower.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years, telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud, and then "all will be fine."
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the concerns of the Tacher government, which literally let my school collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who were most needed, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, including my last election.
No one in East Nottingam could have been confused in any way about my political attitudes and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s request, all I want to say is that when the country joins the Brigitte that will harm households, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the laboratory party.
But I have a message that's not for Notingam Momentum, but for my voters, whether they're members of the Labor Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no matter how devastating threats or political opportunism I'm going to survive, nothing will prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Lesley is a member of parliament for East Notingam
EARLY 38 - 17 Melrose: The Undefeated EAR GOES TO THE EARTH
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph of this beautifully entertaining game on the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
Eventually, they owe everything to their superior defenses, as well as to their well - used opportunities, which the home team brought, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Thank you for Air, they've made better use of their chances than we have."
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave the Air an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Variors game, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimo owed Ear’s leadership with a pen, before, at exactly half the time, he reached a point, so he converted a solo point to achieve 17 - 5 Ear in salvation.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long holdout due to a serious injury to Ruard Nott, which was carried out, and from the beginning, Ear continued to struggle with the tip of Stafford McDoval, converted by Klimo.
Air's CEO, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow cardboard and again, Melrose charged for the additional man with an unconverted point on Bruce Colvin at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
However, the home team recovered and when Stroan Hachinson received a yellow card to defeat Klimo without the ball, McFerson won a tachduan from the rear-end penal line from the sharp attack on the Air.
Klimo converted, as he did almost again from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's hit and sent his winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The silent game star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it has been found to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he's a screenwriter and plays with a long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duot announced that the next ninth season will be the last and appears to be Kirnan planning for life after Creeglenge.
According to the official records, he is Director of Awingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source points out that Kirnan is trying to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded with land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a hidden and laminated naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea is ours right.
It's our duty to come back."
Through the land of Bolivia, the mention of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th - century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the practice of resuscitating the Pacific.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court on October 1st after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course a positive outcome is expected," said Roberto Calsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court ruling on large screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to Bolivia's sea.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic home-born president, who faces a controversial fight for the next year's re-election, also depends heavily on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he solemnly said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court probably won't judge for Bolivia's sake and that it won't change much even for them.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate territory to Chile and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have been behind Bolivia's cause rather than improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accessing the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadija also rejected that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't come to nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Rey spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was working on relaunching blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Young Un.
Rei says it's "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and U.S. protests for the declaration completion of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the president of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion fairs discover the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest shops nearby
If you want to improve the size of your collection of caps or completely block the sun, then do not search any further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of untangled too big hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Finally, unpractice hats launched Instagram in summer, and these designers sent their creations that fall into sight on the track.
The piece that came out of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide pouchlike feather that flooded the model's head.
Other big additions included citricians, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bisar masks, and just in time for Witch Night.
Many of the colored masks had shaved lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecturer than high fashion.
One creation looked like a dive gear full of glasses and a dive tube, and the other looked like a sharp corned ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylish followers predict that huge hats can be found in shops near you.
The big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the broken hat with a pair of feet wide, all from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind too impractical a hat spread through the social media sent another great creation on the track, a strawbag for the beach with a size almost equal to the height of the model it was drawn.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece that was highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results of the exams, which only reinforces with individual and group success in the community's sport, art, music and other achievements.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement appropriate school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable as an election object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it will make him handsome.
If you speak to him in his language, it will hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages surpass all other subjects with the highest rate of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher rating of "5+".
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher score of "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who learned German, 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of those who learned Spanish also achieved "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages now, as an item of choice, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools programs, as well as elsewhere.
The 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey noted that for reasons employers have failed to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, learning a second language will have real advantage in the future with such a life - style.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot priority over competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults from the OK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak foreign languages well enough to speak, and France was the only language spoken over ten per cent, that is, 15 per cent of people.
So investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important in the OK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future may bring.
At the moment it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country's future, so this must be translated into schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
"It must be done" (it must be done).
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Waiting is almost over for the fans who wanted to see Lebron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James will play the first preseason match on Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play, it is not yet decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James was probably going to play a limited time.
After the start of the week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule ahead of Lakers' season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's meeting in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of meetings as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five scheduled Trump meetings next week, including visits to popular places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to confirm his election to fill an empty place in the Supreme Court is in peace, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans may lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it online?
The Trump meeting in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Time zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting in West Virginia on the Internet with live transmission to YouTube.
This week is likely to refer Trump to the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who became tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with expected postponement of the Senate vote for one week, while the FBI's investigation continues.
The main goal of the series of meetings is to help Republicans win the victory for the November elections .
From here, President Trump's campaign said these five meetings next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible with the beginning of the campaign's tough season," Trump's campaign spokesperson for Reuters, who refused to be named.
Scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's meeting can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro.
On Saturday is the second trip to Trump in West Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes of starting individual competitions on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four Saturday afternoons might have been exactly what Cup Ryder needed.
The versatility of happiness is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and most of these games.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had six-point leadership, and now they're four, so we're a little lucky I suppose," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have an advantage, of course, leading four points and twelve more games.
According to Spit, Americans feel that they have a weak wind in the liver, although they have sufficient stimulus, if nothing else is then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each reached three points of four.
The hospital was excellent and was exemplary.
Those strong challenges to the celebration got stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to the equation of four-four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His punch with which they won the 15th match was awaited with a similar call, which tells you he believes the American team is not out of play.
"You just need to get deeper and take care of your game," Spit said.
That's all that's left to each player right now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Cup of Ryder.
The strange but wonderful duel of Europe is four out of four and they can't be wrong.
Molivud was the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win this week and that there will be no other popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nazional, except Flitwood or Molinari.
She prefers both at the same time at different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unjustified.
Boba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of two couples, when he joined Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole they never managed to get out of.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double pairs and four are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't listen to and the way the strategy can change at once.
The Europeans played better as a team, and with that they made significant leadership in the last day, but the four season also showed that the U.S. team could fight even though some, especially Americans, were suspected.
Europeans took 10-6 in the last day of Cup Ryder
Europe will take a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and four of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and French Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far on Le Golf Nazional at four points.
The European team of Thomas Byron, who was struggling to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the US team that had many failures in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans provided more resistance in the four, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the leadership.
Jim Furick’s team needs eight points of 12 individual games a week to hold the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European beginner to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cup of Ryder.
After "smacking" Woods and Patrick Reed in double pairs, they played great and beat the busted Woods and American beginner Bryson Deshambu with an even more expressive result of 5&4.
Woods, who went through two swords on Saturday, played great at the moment, but now lost 19 of the 29 matches in double pairs and four and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning double couples, returned as partner of Henrik Stanson in the four defeating 2+1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third rankings in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all about that pleasant, windy day southwestern of Paris.
The three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas have put in place measures for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive victory of 2&1 over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McClroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost at the beginning, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cup Ryder team has recovered from the lack of four points in an individual game, although as bearers of the title, Furick’s team had a sufficient score to hold the trophy.
After two days, however, the Sunday attack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says "no chance" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the country will renounce nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea took "significant measures of good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing itself to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States." he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way of unilaterally disarming ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints of Washington's resistance to access to nuclear disarmament "in phase", according to which North Korea would be progressively rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree endorsed a joint statement by Kim Jong Won and Donald Trump at the first summit at all by the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to give up in strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmament first and foremost" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream of people who do not know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Rei didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a shell."
However, Rei's tone of speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the General Assembly of the U.S. that the direction of North Korean missiles to the American land was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, much thanks to Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but he said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it, saying "Does it take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must continue completely and without exception until full, finally nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pongjang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the General Assembly of the O.N. and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time went wrong.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that he had made progress, but was denied by North Korea only after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month for the disarmament of a missile building, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "adequate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalizing Washington relations.
Harvard students visit courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing cat culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing when it comes to caring for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women's Hospital Brigam, designs a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the lecture a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he said about the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to the students the basis for how good sleeping habits help in academic and athletic outcomes and improve the general well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-time course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part, there is a picture of a student home that students pressure on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how bad sleep affects the athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants are learning how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart and brain attacks, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chazler.
The culture of pride with “work all night ” still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, must be the "secret weapon" of the student in the struggle against stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said -- even to avoid fatness, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old student from California to chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chazler design the course after visiting one of his hours last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chazler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to bed, and when they wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the circadian rhythm, which leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal is to destroy Gerard's people
Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Stephen Gerard's unresolved team into defeat with 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first victory after the February 4-1 victory in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team won the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the run-in team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and chances of balancing.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston has climbed to third, and they're just behind the hibernian according to the difference in their heads.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical help for head injury after he was obviously hit with a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that took Air to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 of Livingston who won a score with Harts last week and would be glad to see how his well-trained position suffocated the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to reach a point, two minutes after the beginning when Menga's first losing hit Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a blow from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner from defense Alan Litgow could only play outdoors in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Loules clashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian complaint.
Rangers managed to reach only two goals in the first half of the year, but Ibrox Liam Kelly's former goalkeeper didn't get away with the hit with Lasana Kulibali's head and the weak hit of Ovi Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingstone may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with the impact of Jacobs.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, which with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick effect when the winged player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his blockage line.
But Livingston managed to attract the host players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett caught many of the long additions.
Holt's team could've extended the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head at the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton had another request for a penalty after he met Jacobs, but Tomson didn't approve again.
Almanac: Gajger's Calculator Designer
And now one side of our German "Sun of the Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DEBT... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gajer was born in Germany.
Gajger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a detection that led to the creation of a device known as Gajger's counter.
Since then has become the main focus of science, the gagger's counter has become the main focus of popular culture, as in the 1950's "The Ring of Colorado", in which these apparently unreliable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a giger’s counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, that must be jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" foreign cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "look at" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
Method includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes to the laboratory
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer and then be returned to the body
The test vaccine provides promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immunological cells from the patient, their changes in the laboratory, so they can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer called HER2, and then their return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, white lungs and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach by withdrawing immunological cells from patients and their "learning" as target cancer cells works when treating a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp exit, wearing a hat with his motto, after a performance on Saturday night alive.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was observed at the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance attended by US President Donald Trump and said he would run for a post in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called The City of Spirits, where he wore a hat with the title To make America Slavna Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
The Saturday evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavano's testimony before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blaisey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of the West's outcome was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West with the announcement.
West also complained to the public that he had been passing through the stage because of his hat.
"I was ridiculed behind the scene.
They told me, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the basement, he said, according to the Washington Exeter.
West continued: "Do you want to see the submerged place?" he said he would "put his superman cap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments attracted controversy from the audience at least twice, and the evening show team seemed embarrassed, Varajeti reported, a man said about the publisher: "The whole studio is busy".
West was brought as a replacement at the last moment for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boy, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the conservative group TPSAD, Candy Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: thank you for your opposition to the crowd. ”
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was "yours and it's absolutely beautiful".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") for which I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced to Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Caine West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didi's steps, known as Paf Dedi, Paf and P Didi.
The rapper's colleague, Snup Dog, has the name Snup Lion, and of course the dead musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then in the artist of the previous known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakmore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Supreme Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
The star of the Thrones Game series, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic male
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series of the Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, when he said such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
In a statement on the Sandai Times culture section, Keith said he believes that "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #SegagaIy era.
Keith, who recently married the star of the Thrones Game, Rosie Leslie, also admitted that there are "strong feelings" on that issue.
"Personally I have strong feelings, at the moment -- where did we make a mistake with the male?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of male toxicity, thanks to strong male figures.
He continued: “What is born will be called holy, God’s Son?
What do you learn from TV, and what on the street makes young boys feel that they have to have a certain side of the male?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not participate in the extension of the Thrones Game when the show would end next summer, saying he "ended with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will be performing in the restoration of the Real West of Sam Shepard, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that what he met Rose's wife is the best thing that came out of the Throne's Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose was playing Gamerit, a guy who had a romantic attraction with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 to the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are occupied in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
Transfer of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of the people of the LGBT community is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters rejects the data submitted by a member of the staff related to a republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US Representative Maxin Waters rejected the charges Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information to three republican senators in the United States of America on Wikipedia's legislation pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles was convinced that the claims were "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"False, lie, and more of a disgusting lie," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes home address and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from South.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while it lasted the Senate panel to hear allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavano, nominated as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The information provided appeared shortly after the interrogation of Kavano by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstreet reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and information on Waters staff has been published, Hill said.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations -- is in no way responsible for the information being issued.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted internet criticism, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Flischer.
"These denials are nervous," Flischer wrote.
"This shows that she has no temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is charged with something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the accused's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the democrats related to Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics because he seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office reported "the relevant institutions and police on false claims.
"We will enable criminals to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff".
Thinking of Johnny English Attacks Again - Undermining Rowan Atkinson's Spy Liar
Now it's traditional to look for Brexit's elements in every new British movie, which seems to be valid for this renewal of the french of the con, Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: born again.
Will the careful self - ridicule of how obvious we are to nowhere be the new possibility of exporting the nation?
Nevertheless, the face with large eyes and many grins of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "prune" things for the second time -- his name above all means that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for a careful glamour somewhat like Clouseau, has drawings of Mr.Bin and part of the boy playing a note from the Koci song on the fire from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten TV advertisement of Barkles, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I love it when Johnny English gets close to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the wheels of the rotor hit by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humour seems to be meant for children, rather than for adults, and for me, Johnny England's freaking accidents are not as inventive and focused as are the no-brains of Bin Atkinson.
The whole thing is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated into the super secret network of British spies, discovering the identities of all British field agents, to disappoint the post agent -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a more ambitious and combative figure and already suffers from the total meltdown of political imposterity: Emma Tomson gives himself in this character of Quazi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "black" gives lessons for secret agents: there are some good guys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is soon summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bowe, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comic role that Vicky Pepperdin has not been used well.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up all the things in the Royal Secret Service, are going back into action and meet the beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odition of absurd practices: crafted as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a void after they turn themselves into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when they try to use cassava for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud as it is, there's a lot of child TV in the whole movie.
Nice, moderate things.
And as with other movies with Johnny English, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give a role to Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Labourers deny that British plan to work for four days a week but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week -- but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants company bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three - day weekend, but they would get the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "corresponds" with the party's economic agenda and the country's plans to be inclined to the workers.
The four-day work week transition is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to have gains from changes in the economy.
A prominent party member said to Sandy Times: “The strategy review should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a pursuit that is consistent with the party's accession to rebalance the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party won't be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party was betting on a four-day work week during the campaign for parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not a party's strategy and the party is not considering such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used the Labourists' conference last week to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to seize the power of "no-face directors" and "profits" in municipal companies.
The plans of the office in the shade also mean that current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" because of non-ethical behaviour.
He also confirmed the plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and to create Inclusive Property Funds with 10 per cent of the private company's capital being owned by employees, who could take an annual dividend of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Gream, John Kennedy's making a statement about "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano can rethink them.
FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavano postponed the final vote for his nomination at the Supreme Court for at least one week and updated the question of whether the Bureau's findings could rethink some republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges were filed, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, inseparable."
Gream's voice, however, seems to have been carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavano and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blaisey Ford.
"All that she calls them couldn't confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now being held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizens Festival will visit tens of thousands of people coming to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to some world leader, telephone call or other useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Golbal Citizens because they've spent 12 years achieving the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert really a way to convince people to seek something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel that they're making a real difference by signing an Internet petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, which have acted for many different purposes.
They say that these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to point out dedication and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and statements resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, an investor-implementation partnership, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children take advantage of their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Rwanda to help with the country's malnutrition after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens the same as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of Power of Food, told the audience at the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls for improved nutrition for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Izranta, which will include 5 million women and children with indignible interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
From the Global Citizens, they replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey — never going to succeed.
But like the big civil and anti-apartment movements before us, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mona are some of the artists who will take part in this year's New York event, whose host will be Deborah-Le Fournes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the "block" Navy to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, discovered US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, as Washington Exeter quoted.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria -- the name, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a paramilitary to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he allegedly said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the maritime roads remain open and if it is necessary to block their energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinki is addressing the presence of an event organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that represents itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is effective.
"Iran and Russia's economic option is, more or less, raising the role and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking about Russia as "one uncomfortable pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement followed after Trump's administration launched a mission to encourage exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "inappropriate" North Tec 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made from Berlin a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tec 2, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres pipeline, is just an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's firm opposition to the project is just for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure-making tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance came against Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will carefully examine" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will carefully examine" whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren acknowledged that he was thinking about running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully examine whether to run for president."
Warren assessed the work of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city assembly and said he "has led the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open to criticism of Trump and the man he nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in its electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Saffolk/Boston Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey has shown more support for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential nomination, and 48 per cent opposing.
Other well-known names from the democratic party that are being discussed on nomination in 2020 are former vice president Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sara Peelin talks about Trek Peelin' post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's meeting
Trek Peylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after reporting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after he comes back, I know how other families feel broken up because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peelin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "are returning a little different, they are coming back firmly, they are coming back and wondering if there is respect for what they and their friends from the air force, and every other member of the army has given it to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assault on a woman's face, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennet, a police spokesman in Vasila.
18 Allied states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new US policy that prevents the asylum of victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday as support for an asylum seeker who challenged politics, N.B.C. News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against Parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender, represented by Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as the source of a large number of asylum requirements in the United States, as nations with persistent gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annuls the 2014 Immigration Complaints Board's decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The city's public defender of Washington Carl Rasin said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of bringing laws at the federal and international levels".
"The federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the defenders in the letter claim that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is detrimental to the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary workforce".
Public defender Jeff Sess ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sess said in presenting the policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate relief efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her male baby in the center of evacuation in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes and choose from their cited objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who had fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside because of frequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris said to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard her ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Indicts China for "dissemination" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper announced a four-party ad in the US daily, counting the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's paid addendum in De Moin Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in US elections for the November 6th congress, China rejected the indictment.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections combined US Reuters services, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising for trade promotions, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which import tariffs are balanced with each other.
China's payroll tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were directed at exporters from states such as Iova, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former, longtime governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing is hurting US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of propaganda advertising in our free press".
"In the defamation of the propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the delicate American tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in the De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the true reflection of the desperate thoughts that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most read newspapers rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Republicans away from women's votes before mid-term elections, due to debacle with Kavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans do not observe or defend Brett Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially for women in the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already been clarified that they want to continue voting.
From such things there is no going back," wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that the pressure on the FBI's investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, in front of Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters called "Novemvri is coming!" in protest in the Senate hall, when Republicans, who have control of the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue with the nomination of Kavano despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, Mick said.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be high," said Stu Rottenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which her allegations of sexual assault against the judge in the Supreme Court were detailed, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Style, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to N-B-Ci's news.
"It's not just about voting in the commission or the last vote, or whether Kavano is going to be heard, it's also about how the republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Gay Cecil, US Priorities Director, a group that helps in choosing Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided about whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavano, although more accept the first party.
A new Yu-Gov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they definitely or probably believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavano was probably or definitely lying in witnessing, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one more, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate's Legal Affairs Commission, under oath last week, that Kavano attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez charges that the judge in the Supreme Court showed her genitals at a party while studying at Jeil in the 1980 ’ s.
World Network Designer Plans to Start New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Lei, the inventor of the World Network starts with a startup business that claims to be a rival of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrapt, is a company built on the open-source Solid platform in Berners-Lei.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernards-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "data store on the Internet" or a shorter POD.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluck, Sleck, and Spotifaj to all be available to a viewer at the same time.
What's unique about the personal data storage on the Internet is that it depends only on the user who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project work agreement and a coder-won community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrapt website.
Bernards-Lei said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We're not looking for their permission."
In a statement to the Media, published on Saturday, Bernards-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network".
In 1994, Bernards-Lei transformed the internet based on the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Bernards-Lei is an influential speaker in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Bernards-Lei added.
Bernard Van: A famous patron of the Victorian cross since World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church who received the Victorian Cross during the first world war as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Van received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
However, he was shot four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military rank.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin, "beneath a very dense fog and under a strong fire of guns and mitrals".
He later ran to the shooting sites and with the "greatest courage" he went ahead before attacking his own cannon nest and disabling three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I'll never be able to fulfill, but it's something that doesn't make him modest."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also placed a wedding after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it's a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown with the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of combined martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead of getting Pepa Prase
Imagine, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, and you don't have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 battles, including six with the main card that were displayed live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gerard Mosasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face, viewers in Britain were shocked when the channel was transferred to Pepa Prase.
Some were not impressed when they stayed awake until early hours because of the fight.
One of Twitter fans described the transfer of a child's cartoon film as "some painful joke".
"The law was such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, Vice-President of Belator for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
"Pepa pig", yes"
Belator Scott Cooker's president said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think that when I think about re-launching, I think we can probably find a solution," Kuker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were welcome.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we went too far.
It's an accident.
Discs on the empty island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking on the first radio 4 Discos on the empty island, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that what became a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-standing show Kirsty Yang took a multi-month vacation due to the disease.
Appearing as a comparative character in Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferior value and diversity were the things that gave me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-broroned medals Olympic became a known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The three-time world champion said about man love -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 -- "suddenly."
Daley married a crippled 20-year-old last year, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you pass through so much at an early age," he went to the first 14-year-old Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the gold medal at the Olympics.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you weren't here to be in the first order," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to jump in front of the home audience of the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — the Pride of Heather Small — that turned his head in preparations for the Olympics and that he was still energizing.
B-B-Cy Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Mikkelson, the horse is not in shape, was on the bench during the Cup of Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record Sunday as he plays the 47th Cup Ryder game, but he will have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michelson, who played the biennal event, recorded 12th time, was sent to the bench of Captain Jim Furick during the Saturday double pairs and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the fifth winner, he divided the time to cheer up and practice his game, the scope, hoping to correct what he was silent about.
He has never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf Nazional playground, where the distant roughs hit a regular punishment in neglect.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the exact champion of British Open Francis Molinari, who plays in pairs with the beginner Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson's game can be doomed.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understands the role he had today, touched me behind my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the celebrities and has been given much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what happened, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Mikelson's gonna pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games at the Cup of Ryder on Sunday.
That could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Mikelson has 18 victories, 20 lost matches and seven and a half, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun playing with him, as was this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant leadership in the face of individual competitions in the last day of the Cup of Ryder can easily become an uncomfortable position.
The Danish debuted at a game in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "the goal line was crossed only with the noses", with a minimum of 141⁄2-131.2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Walderama; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a while," Bjorn said, figuratively, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a leadership of 10-6 on Le Golf Nazional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You're going ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play properly.
This is not finished as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and focus remains on it.
I've been saying, I focus on 12 players on our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world."
He added that Bjorn was satisfied with the results of his golfers: “I don’t want to make premature assessments on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are expected to have individual games, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the abilities are tested as a golfer.
That's the message to be sent to the players, to give up on themselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should give it all to himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will ask players to play better individually than they played in twos, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furic himself was at both ends of the last day's change, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe carried out the "Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on average competitions.
We're putting the line right and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of opposing Rory McClroy first, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to act this way with the guys because I think we'll cover everything," Bjorn said about the choice in the individual games.
The new German military ship is being postponed again
The German Navy's latest fleet was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships since the cold war, but it will not happen at least by next year because of the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of "Rhinland-Falz", the leading ship of the new class of Fregates Baden-Wittemberg, is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the DiCait newspaper, calling for a military spokesperson.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014 but the issues after delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Budden-Wittemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful gun, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, as a small radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is tax maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frescoes, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans -- will already be obsolete until they enter service, notes Di Cite.
The F125 accident frigate reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned to the shipyard Bloom and Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a number of key "software and hardware defects" that caused the warship to be useless if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Budden-Wittemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the older Bremen class crew.
It has also come out that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add upgrades in the future.
Rainland-Falc weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problem hardware, the price of the entire project -- including crew training -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the newest frescoes are particularly important because of warnings about Germany’s reduced sea power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, confirmed that the Navy "is missing ships that can be deployed".
The representative said that the problem had worsened over time, because old ships were withdrawn from service, but were not secure ships for replacement.
He complained that none of the Budden-Wittemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Lilies
A new research is being carried out on property in the Scottish mountain regions to find out how the lilys use the area in the search for food.
There is hope that discoveries will respond to the behavior of unique flying boobs and help to conduct future protection activities.
The study of scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano lilys, as well as the long ears and daubenton lilys in Inverow Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the beekeepers during the season.
N.A.S. personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all the images will determine the frequency depending on the type of bees.
Then a map of the habitats will be drawn to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, an adviser to nature conservation in En-Ti-es, hopes that the results will find out which areas of life are most important to the lilacs and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows, and the best way to maintain forests for lilys and other associated species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the bed and the loss of their homes.
Veterans and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky fly strips and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The Lilies aren't actually blind.
However, because of their nightly fishing habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find the insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-Ti-es, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the lily very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and only lily reserve in Scotland of the property Triv in Damfris and Galoway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for lilacs," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good dwellings.
But there's a lot of unknown things about the Lilies, so the work we do here and in other property will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He stresses that it is important to check that there are lilacs before real estate renovations are carried out because unconscious destruction of the bed can destroy up to 400 women and young women, and destroy the entire local population.
The Lilies are protected and are illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Trust for the Protection of Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about the lilies and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected charges of rape, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called rape charges "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has filed the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is charged with rape of America, named Catherine Majorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers, several hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was delivered today is false news," the gold ball's five-time winner told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine." The player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for the charges they have called "an unacceptable transfer of private life doubts", according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
Apparently, the prosecution incident took place in June 2009 in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed before the Clarke Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped under that "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she entered into a deal without judicial participation because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses its world leader's status in car production after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it is "anxious" what Toyota-Britain said about B-B-Ci, that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border stops in the case of Brexit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a stop to production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how the cross-border trade would work when leaving the EU without an agreement, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-em-we says, for example, he'll close his mini-factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works under the "precisely time" system, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a break on the border that industry believes could cause delays and gaps in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory stock at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future EU relations is "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We need to have the best agreement that will allow us not only the success we will enjoy in the present, but we need to seize this opportunity," he said for today's Bi-Bi-Ci Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what a very successful set of logistics chains is".
He could not say how long production would have been stopped, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, who has been a member of the factory union in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “As soon as these jobs are lost, my experience tells me that they will never return.
According to a government spokesperson: "We have established a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Public Counsellor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week" because he continues to fight about Brett Kavano's nomination for a judge in the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential violation of the laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby threaten Miller's independence, he's been promoting talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times said Rosenstein was thinking about carrying a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But by publishing the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a meeting of the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavano and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, also testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into Kavano's lawsuits, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump Sara Sanders's press secretary appeared on Fox News Sunday.
To the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things are going, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders did not hold a briefing for journalists in the White House on September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings is not due to the lack of "great influence" on television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has a direct chance to ask questions to the president of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it more often and you're witnesses that we've been doing it all the time over the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace the press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting high officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on Brexit's fears
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jin Freeman, a deputy in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of the decided status applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues and their colleagues share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are useful to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after he has suffered head injury
Cristion Abercrombie, a defensive player (linebaker) of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, says Mike Authority of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred immediately before halftime.
"He came to the side line of the playground and are only rustling the country," Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombi oxygen out of the playground, and then put it in the closet and carried it to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from "WSMV" in Nesville, Tennessee, that Abercrombi had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays his first season in red dress in the Tennessee State after the Illinois transfer.
He made a total of five clashes on Saturday before he left the game, resulting in a total of 18 clashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralise Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The highest administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, which will be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be regarded as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on people with high pay.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds increasing the government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property for rent may reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year with this move.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's newly built property is purchased by people who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which has led to an increase in prices and has caused difficulties for people who buy property for the first time to get involved in this property purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of offering high prices of the property with which they hold the land, but did not use it and asked Ms. May to change the access to housing quotas in order to correct the "disgusting situation of homeing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive domestic reforms, including housing controls and the end of the evictions without justification.
He also wants the councils to give them greater authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I said I would devote my prime minister to returning to the British dream of life being better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our damaged domestic market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not wrong for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the national club in Scotland.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the club in the northeast, which is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the "Station of Light" after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross said about the Scottish Sport Sound of BBC.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father and always something drew me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not upset knowing that he should follow such well-established names in such a big club after he previously declined the offers of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by "can I return this club to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think that I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross works as a manager for only three years, in which his career entered after he worked as a assistant to the chief at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to stop the fall in the third league and return St. Mirren from losing title in the next season.
Ross says he now feels better than when he played "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"That was probably a true crusade to me," he recalls at the alloa takeover.
"I sincerely believed that the career as a manager was the right choice for me, better choice than the career as a player.
It sounds strange because it worked well, I made enough money to enjoy certain high advantages.
But building a career as a player can be very difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a Sunday basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good about the manager’s role.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to one study, the perfect beer time is 5:30 p.m. Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw growth in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA for business advisory services in determining these figures said: "Suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants declined significantly.
The fall in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which drinks are sold mostly saw much greater growth compared to the previous years, unlike the restaurants where the fall was observed.
The pubs in which most food is sold were also badly affected by the solar periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a holiday analyst and hostess from RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the fall in sales of 4.8 per cent over a period of one year will be particularly devastating as a complement to the current pressures on costs.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for local owners where food is sold mostly and time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the much needed respiration."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, represented 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the stop in the release of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of the same 47 operational groups with a combined revenue of over 9 billion pounds and is a firm benchmark for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret profile on social media that he hides from his parents
One study showed that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile on social media that hides from their parents and teachers
Research involving 20,000 high schools showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
News increases fear that such profiles are exposed to sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" profile that they show their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, is creating a social media profile that he hides from adults.
Research involving 20,000 high schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news adds to the fear that such profiles are exposed to sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" profile that they show their parents, while they also have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others "to rape her."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics committee
Elid Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Committee of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most outstanding athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Bitty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"All in the Scottish, British and world athletic community have great respect for Elid, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a member of the committee," Betty said.
Doyle said: "I am prepared to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help in the proper direction of sport in Scotland."
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 metres in the Atlanta Games in 1996, along with the total of four gold medals in the Olympics, which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether or not to what extent I would get stuck.
The whole process was solid, but I was able to fully anchor, so I could go back and practice agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising where mothers are compared to cows causes a division of Internet opinions
A company for the production of breast pumps caused a division of Internet opinions when it published an ad in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to cow milling.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's most popular breast pump", a user-oriented technology company Elvie has announced a funny advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump has provided to the nursing mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of sand on a song whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I chew milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this, it doesn't go away, these are my breasts."
The referendum continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, crush my chest."
However, the advertisement published on Facebook by the company caused internet controversy.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it highlights the "horrific" of the dairy industry.
"It is indeed a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like we should be pregnant and born to be able to produce milk, except for the fact that their children are being stolen from them just a few days after they are born," one of the commentators said.
Elvie's breast pump is discreetly integrated into the breast-feeder ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment states: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another added: "Really inappropriate advertising."
Others, on the other hand, defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "smiley."
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I still had a baby.
I felt just like a cow because of the milling.
The ad's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial designed for mothers who chew milk (often in their jobs or in toilets) and feel like "cows."
This does not advertise a lack or condemnation of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were being picked up in their chests.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the attitude that many women who use milling pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits into the breast-feeder, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out of the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is really a revolutionary product and deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who milk cows and milk cows, we wanted milk milling with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to the center of attention, showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump is present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of children migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children in detention has increased significantly, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that strong rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared the threat of their own stay in the country if they asked to be sponsors of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer last week, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for the sponsorship of minors without association.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested do not have a previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and most of them are foreigners with criminal record.
That's why we keep chasing those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order to speed up the handling of children, the authorities introduced new rules that some of them would be required to appear in court within one month after they were arrested, not within 60 days, as the shelter workers say the previous standard was being voted.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be indifferent to getting relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become upset and depressed, which can lead to violent escape or escape attempts, the shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months say.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where because of its size there is a greater likelihood of neglecting signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without providing enough time for them to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends, could add to the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces illegally resided in Syria's territory under the excuse of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will deal with them appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of which are trained and advised by Kurdish and Syrian Arabs, who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accused "some of the western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing the question which should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebellion created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the war action will be directed towards the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters associated with Al Qaeda, who "will be rooted".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition to prepare a true constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem determined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "viewing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate is temporarily interrupted by implicity and scandal, which is likely to be much hoped for by the Liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final in a presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there's no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact time rating has increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says that Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in the impact time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baier, the leading television producer of the "Designated Survival" drama of "ABC" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol is destroyed by the attack.
Nel Skowel, a veteran in comedy writing and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Skowel told me.
There's also a certain amount of fun in the whole mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Exclusion from all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours who are debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his Fair book, a bomber jacketed by Paul Manafort's skin from $15,000 (the "wear with fat arrogance," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of Mr. Trump's shocking anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.

When I visited Mr. Fles this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in and watched "MSNBC" while filming "CNN".
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Cavano was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was critical.
"I remember making all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Influx of external funds in the toughest mid-term elections in the Upper House race
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganisation of the congressional areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh, a Democratic Representative Connor Lambb was nominated, which took place in another area of the emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Kitt Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th congressional area, which is largely intertwined with the new 17th congressional area.
The maps were modified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old areas were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition for funding campaigns among the party's main sponsors, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Party Campaigns ("DCCC") and the National Committee on Republican Party Campaigns ("NRCC").
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, held in March, characterized by a wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area with 20 points.
Political experts give the democrats little advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then he resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under low pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of Trump's organisation.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nawert, State Department spokesman in his statement earlier this month.
But only with regard to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have a detrimental effect on the country in Central America and high unemployment and homicide rates in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any reflection on El Salvador's punishment.
Vice-President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration assigns to the meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the status of anonymity.
Their positions were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the status of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is to publish a report by Special Adviser Robert Miller on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very strong evidence in the public records.
Mr. Miller allegedly also directed his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress is changed, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility for that body while preparing to appear again before voters, and perhaps before the jury composed by his colleagues.
There are many insecuritys here, and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the timing of this fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler in a state attack if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unmistakable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are now facing a number of such changes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot table after this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secretly photographing the president and speculated that he was not fit for the job he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"How will we act if Brett Kavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unjust, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year for the Congress that will charge Mr. Trump?
If we fall into all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that won't happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath table with a swastika logo.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Gream Dorans of "Rangers" with an optimistic attitude in front of the Rapid Vienna match
"Rangers" are hosts of the race with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, but are aware of the fact that after the unresolved game against "Villarreal" in Spain earlier this month, victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorenz, a middle-ranking knee injury player, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unsolved game 2-2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a jumpboard for greater accomplishments.
"That was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
We might have been able to give a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half, and we were better.
On Thursday, another big European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it'll be a hard game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year in view of everything that happened — my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope now we can move forward, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although the study participants had a clear understanding of the way they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by "Nationalwide" said they talked to their mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Animal Insurance Company.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for you if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family, and talk about where and how you can get it because such choices can be a significant factor in determining your expenses.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice to finance long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy at cash value, which can help you to cover your expenses or to secure yourself self-sustaining with your own resources if you have them.
Manage your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the beginning.
Take full care so that you can empower a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think, too, about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medicines he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in a written form to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, it's about who the doctors are?" asks Martin.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he returned home from his departure.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb area when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred about 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expecting an increase in the number of victims.
Because of the interruption of the communications, relief personnel cannot obtain information from Dongala County, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epidemic of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people from Palau were evacuated after the disaster.
Several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year-old when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a county that extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says that Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the West Coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provoked tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra toward the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis to destroy the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mentawaj islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis to reach up to ten feet [10 m] and destroy dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: Earthquake with a square focus hit the Pidi Jaya District in Aceh, thereby causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sara Palin was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, interference with a report on family violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in Matsu detention facility with the possibility of exit if he pays a sum of 500 US dollars, KTUU said.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he said he was "definably innocent" when asked how he was clarified before the court, they said from the network.
Palin faces three A-class offences, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a B-class violation, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time they've been charged with Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before Alaska's veterinary court is underway.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report on the crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by the veterinary groups in 2016, after she said her son's violent behavior stems from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck an area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social media are circling videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Syfulo Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died, a rare one that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 in October, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot to attack the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan and run through the pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipo "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to a report on the intention to request a death penalty delivered to the South District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is an opportunity to pronounce a death sentence on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed an indictment against Saipo on 22 grounds, including eight charges of murder for the purposes of recruitment, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, it took "detail planning and thought," the prosecutors said, in which the way Saipov did it described it as "horrible, cruel and devious."
"Syfulo Habibulaevic Sayipov challenges, injuries, damage and loss of the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Daren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernán Feruci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," the state's statement of intention said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a case of death was prosecuted in the South District of New York.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for July and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to a death sentence with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
The police reported that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police also reported that he asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He made himself clear that he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders represented by Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence, instead of accepting confession of guilt and sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved," Paton said.
Saipov's defense previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Party MP Tori says NIJEL FARAZ should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz today, during the protest of the Tori party's conference, promised that he would "mobilise the people's army".
Former party leader Ukip said politicians must "pass the heat" of the Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he is responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn of the Birmingham march said the United Kingdom would so far "be outside the EU" if Mr. Faraz was secretary to Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs. May in terms of bringing her deeply divided members together was stressed by counter-Bregith members of the Tori party who joined a special protest against Bragit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chekers plan despite the attacks by the pro-Bregith people, the counter-Bregith people and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue with efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force the Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said to the pro-Breggzit "Leave Means Leave" meeting in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the plan of the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for the negotiations, we would still be outside the EU," he said.
The Ambassador of Wellingboro added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the plan of the Checkers."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars for now to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestion that the public opinion changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people changed their opinion and wanted to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and Pro-Breggzit party, was also present at the march and said to reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Checkers plan is not well-accepted by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well-accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who owe our victory to the elections.
Please give up the Chekers plan and start listening to us."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz at the meeting said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to deliver Brexit, feel the warmth.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has enabled us to win the Brexit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Bregzit people marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners entitled "The Torievs Against Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at conservatives about the security issues facing the opening of the conference regarding the party's application.
"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing called good Braggzit," he added.
Warren plans well to consider candidacy for the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "think well about the presidential nomination" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke of his future during the city assembly in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run the elections again in November against the Republican party's state representative Jeff Dill, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidency, using the format of a city assembly.
One of the audience asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren answers that it is time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which includes putting women on top."
Arrested suspect of the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the LSU team
Baton Rose Police, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team what happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rose Police Department announced Deiton Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a headshot wound and as a result of the same death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, "247sports" said.
Wade was involved in defending his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possession of weapons, and shooting at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rose.
As a junior 192 cm tall who grew up in Baton Rose, Sims played 32 games with 10 performances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 caught balls after the game.
Grand Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders provided him with victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the time that Walter Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the cedar while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vetel to attack his opponent.
The wind came first into the box and let Hamilton fight the storm at the end of the group, something that should have played a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and came behind the Bethel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one who made Ferrary's driver reluctant to leave the interior of his free risk to remain side by side after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Versapen started from the back row of the network and his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh place.
Then he drove most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and reach Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He finally entered the 44th round box, but couldn't increase the rate in the other eight rounds, so Raikonen came to fourth place.
It's a tough day today because Walter's done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team made a really exclusive decision to have its two in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad speech on the body
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Finnstein at a meeting Saturday about her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassie Ford accusing the High Court candidate Brett Kavano of sexual assault.
In his speech at the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "wicked and dishonest and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the Senate over the last few days you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and ruthless and rude," he said.
"When you see announcements and flows of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finstein, did you publish this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Finnstein on charges against Kavano by Ford in July, and they were published in early September, but Finnstein denied that the leaking of the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finnstein told the committee, "The Hill," said.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented about the same meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was really a bad talk on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst talk of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democrats use instructions to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their evil, shame, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to need to drive back their power and control," the president said as Mediaite said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants match against Dundee
"Dundee Stars" rewarded for losing the match under the Elite League on Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning the 5-3 reward in Dandi on Saturday.
Giants got ahead of two goals achieved by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Counni took advantage of the host before Dwyer returned the leadership of Giants.
Francoa Bushar once for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season under the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two parties in the season, with Giants winning in the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFol, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the game, Sullivan secured the host's leadership by 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the result 15:16.
The two took care of Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the night of the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them again with a powerful game and goal, with the result was 27:37.
Counni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time to secure the leadership of Dundee in the match later in the second period and he secured the victory of his team half of the last period of the fifth match .
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next match on Friday on a home field in Milton Kanes.
Flight controller killed helping hundreds of people to escape the earthquake
A flying controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulavesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues avoided saving their own lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufre Airport in Palu, which was constantly being drawn.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air flight number 6321, which was then on the runway, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the time he thought the tower was tearing apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Pala.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even access," Soutopo Purvo Nugroho's spokesperson said.
The dams that reached up to ten feet [6 m] devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "The quick help carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said about "CNN": "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help its survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president, Yoko Vidodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a man disappeared after the plane fell into the lagoon
The airline operating with the plane that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, after previously stated that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the aircraft that tunnelled.
In an Air Niugini statement, they said they couldn't find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
On Friday, officials announced that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the US Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low.
"It's an extremely good job," Janes said.
Janes said that he and the others managed to cross the water that reached half their way to the exits for emergencies on the plane he was on.
He said that the stewardess were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the port reconstruction also helped rescue by taking people aboard the coast before the plane sinking about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in accidents of aircraft companies registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have included the Air Niugini.
Analyst established a time frame at night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who is accused of having burned a woman in Missipi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He pointed out to the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received information about the location of several mobile phones, which show that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger said.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that that day wasn't in town.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nesville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew one week.
Rowlett said some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to kill this genre's negative attitude, including positive messages in his music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" claims that the hip-hop is far from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akalah" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?
New York's granddaughter is suing a married couple because she was fired after sending a "racist" message
New York's granddaughter is suing a married couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she received a message from the mother who complained that she was "one more black woman."
The couple deny that they are racist, saying that the complaint is in fact "suffering."
Linsy Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Gizel Morris found out she was black.
"NOEeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing what she actually did, Plasco-Faxman, feeling "uneasy" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, was doing a bad job and that instead she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, says New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for the first working day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the couple and seeks compensation for the release of $350 a day for six months, a commitment that will involve her living with the family, for which she was initially engaged, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned the charges of racism, saying that Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after being insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't think.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said wife Joel Plasco for Post.
"But would you trust your children in the face of what you were rude, even when you were wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying the complaint was "suffering", Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and that she was in "very difficult situation".
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still pending, the public immediately condemns the couple’s social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Padington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a sword that speaks, is found in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before receiving inspiration to write a little toy in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60-year-old of publishing the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to miss at all," she said.
"But since he felt Padington so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success does not owe you alone.
I think Padington's success has been accepted in this way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to the Padington himself."
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"I hope he called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that he is expected to not survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Tashie, I really love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications that doctors gave to keep her heart pumping slowly dwindled, and they left her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems are failing.
I just had to sit there and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay home."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I pointed my head, and the tears did not stop.
It was hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Grieving women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
"Everyone remembered him in his smile.
People always said that his smile could brighten every room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother who was 11 years old at the time was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that this will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis drew up the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it's about friends.
Don't sit still, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphrey, who is Mrs. Davis' long-standing friend, lost her partner, Mark, who was married 15 years ago, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he never looked them in the eye and made any contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they had to find a way to get through it: “This is what destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must continue to fight."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain since the FBI started the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something that looked like what he was looking for, namely an investigation with a limited time, with a limited scope, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the committee is "dispersing" in terms of the underlying partisan useless state.
Why didn't Kavano and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their fluctuation is due only to the timing.
The mid-term elections should take place in just a few weeks, or on November 6th, and if republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George V. Bush calls the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can have at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, enabling Vice President Mike Pens to change the unresolved outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea is "decreasing" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Beyong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unity Ministry, says that last year there were 1.127 crossings at the border compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human trafficking are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most North Korean refugees are currently receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stopping negotiations on denuclearisation.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards the goal - the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho charged on Saturday with sanctions imposed by the United States for stagnation in progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally first disarm ourselves," Mr. Rei said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavano "historic" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavano " hysterical" and said that if his temper is taken into account, he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did so, they would say it was "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Coffee emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blassie Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavano was very emotional when he introduced his introduction, sometimes shouting and missing as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grossful and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the Liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes that Cavano's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has shown himself biased against the democrats.
"I think it's disqualificating itself with those statements and the way you attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavano from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Coffee is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the possible convictions that would bring Kavano against the Act on Access to Health Care or Roy versus Wade, because he is considered subject to conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavano did not answer the questions as to whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter court and expect us to say, "It's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's really a sharp criticism, months and years of collecting anger, which she can't free herself without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who performed an executive job somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts to cry, she tells her face with something to talk about,“ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's brilliant."
The tears are permitted as an exhaled vent for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first workplaces in the office where men dominated was when I started crying with unbearable anger and an older woman, a cold manager who I always had some fear of, caught me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her to think about the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she said 30 years later in a laugh.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched a long time ago, it did not have enough financial resources, so he promised that he would not enter the race unless he collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave her men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she asked.
During a speech in which he announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, thanks to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that it was so difficult to collect funds and target voters, and not delegates and anger toward sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted to the case.
"You'd think Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be a good job for Beijing
Opening the fire with the beginning of the US-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, the struggle between countries can be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by depriving key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has been significantly escalating during this week with the introduction of new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), with half of the goods coming from the United States of China being effectively decomposed.
Beijing has returned to nature every time, that is, recently imposed rates of between five and ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States with the same measure, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same in a short time.
Making Washington withdraw means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the US trade war can result with positive support for China in the long term because the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for a sudden economic downturn in which any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a tank tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer, which owes to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the state to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives are now secure.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant win of Ryder's Paris Cup
Europe's team won the US team in the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final result from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a European field and has not won Ryder's title for the 1993 European Cup.
Europe has regained the primacy since Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed for victory over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, led the ball to the water in pairs-3 to the 16th hole, losing Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been highlighted in all circles, becoming one of the four players that achieved the result of 5-0-0 after the tournament started in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5/4 of the lowest ranking European team player Torbyrn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter from England, which may have been the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most prizes in the tournament with 25.5 points won during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
Team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," emotional Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He is now retreating to the site of his fellow-citizen John Ram, who on Sunday one of them beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a result of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now he has a 13-21-3 career record at Ryder's.
It's an amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 big titles, ranking Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team for the weekend was trying to direct the game to low grass fields, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-quality golf course throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after the disappointing game of his team said "I'm proud of these guys, they were really fighting.
One morning we faced difficulties with the team from Europe.
We were fighting.
He's digging down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Association of Professional Golfers and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit them.
We were overcome.
