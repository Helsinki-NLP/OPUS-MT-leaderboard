The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria is 29 per cent
Citational weakening of the two sides has led to a major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, to the Sunday early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader Swazu for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korean Heitman Jörg Haider, is about to return triumphally to the state policy.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections, but loses 5.5 per cent.
Even worse was the EVP, which loses almost nine per cent of its votes by 25.6 per cent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of the Austrian war, and especially of the people who caused the early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP emerged from the coalition, people had a significant leap ahead of SPÖ.
However, the voters apparently punished them for letting the government waste.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible resignation of the President of the Party and former Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molter.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such development would likely facilitate the path to the increasingly likely Eastern European election outcome, namely the restoration of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) received 18 per cent in advance and the 11 per cent in the vote - the social democrats also expressed fears about the resumption of 1999 when people agreed with the populists (then still being united, the FPÖ withdrew from the BZÖ in 2005) to the common government, which even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
This development is clearly being pursued by Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna to state policy.
The Green Party has yet to be reached in Parliament, but it has lost slightly and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently exceeded the four-percent limit and failed to reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If a problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were complained in India about the illegal collection of diamonds, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The Minister introduced it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian opponent, Pranab Mukherji.
"If it didn't work out, then yes, there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting that took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherdji said that in judicial matters, executive power can be difficult to deal with.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Schwach, who was acquitted of the charges and punished by torture, the central government could deal with the local government in Darjilling, whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji would be the best to appeal to the higher court.
He could then ask for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself to his partner in the proceedings.
"It recommends calling to a higher court, then it would be possible to forgive him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
Indians also acknowledge it," Schwarzenberg said.
As the Czech Republic stressed before its partner, as the Czech Republic has said, the problem of Czech entomologists is of great importance.
"We really regard it as a deep mistake to arrest and deplor these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he received an offer from the Indian side to deal with the matter was avoided by the minister.
"I've already got quite enough promises," he said just.
Czech judge the battle of the seabed
It will enter the walled electronic map, which is represented by Australia and adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also to the seabed.
The area is, however, large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Law.
His boss, the head of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the interpretation follows and sometimes fills.
There will be a working wave and excitement.
The seabed has so far hidden a few known worlds, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ore and other non-growth raw materials can be found here, but so far unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A bottom greater than a solid
The coastal states have now begun to be heavily involved in the new sub-sea areas.
According to the UN Convention, they enjoy their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive requirement under the Convention for all sources of continental shelf.
"Simply taken, the part of the seabed is the continental shelf and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It runs beyond the shoreline, often even beyond the borders of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many cost-research and measurement.
It is the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have so far succeeded," Mikulka adds.
World advertising has recently seen Australia’s success, which, as the first one, has substantially expanded its submarine countries.
However, New Zealand has also won the seabed, which the Commission granted last week, is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million sq km], about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will be paid to them in the future by using the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
They shall gradually submit their requests to other States.
They can do so up to ten years since they ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean bottom area begins by a convention declared "the common heritage of humanity".
There's no state here anymore having an exclusive position.
The right of withdrawal in this area shall be conferred on a convention established by an international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, but there is no Clondajk," says Director Mikulka, in the superintendent, saying that "its individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually sealed".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
The part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are being discussed with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
It was acquired in 1991 under the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, the status of the so-called "proceeding investor".
It is authorized to live in the ClarionClipperton area of the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area surveyed by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovak.
The bottom is a member, it's some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"There can be a stretch on a total range of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Ryan, said.
The Macedonian employee of Rober Sandev's division brings one such concrete to the show.
It resembles a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a wonderful sham that, according to legend, revitalized Golem.
Germany's special deployment units were at the time of release of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany to deal with the crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation came to an end, special units were prepared, however, there was no deployment.
Further details of the conditions for the release of eleven in Egypt are gradually being obtained to the public.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and Internal Affairs, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue action.
According to the Ministry, both civil servants and members of the German anti-terrorist police group GSG9 were at the point of release, as well as police officers from the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics officers from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
According to another statement, however, both ministries from Monday afternoon were not needed by the German forces because the kidnappings had allowed their prisoners to go and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has adopted the aid offered by Germany as a supportive force for action on the ground.
"It didn't come to that luck," said one of the spokespersons of the social ministry inside.
The attackers kidnapped a group of passengers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and also eight Egyptian guides to Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were transferred.
The identity of the kidnappings has remained unclear at the latest, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, salvation is in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't express himself for the details of the release.
There is no information available in Berlin so far when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Billd", all five tourists should also fly to Germany by special force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
American Photographers rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress left a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones index has gone down a lot.
In relation to 206 to 227 votes, the United States House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of American President George W. Bush and the leaders of both sides, the majority did not find themselves for a program that should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
With the dramatic action, the delegates desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of the honourable Member to express his consent, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet come to light," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised to fall again sharply after the notice of shrinking the package.
Experts are now counting on other major turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the House of Representatives and the Senate should agree.
Travel agents record the increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in travel:
According to one study, there has been an increase in the booking of flights for the following months compared with the previous year's marked turnover - for the winter season even more than 30 per cent.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans remain willing to travel unharmed.
During the winter season reservations, travel offices reported an increase of 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the DRV statement, the turnover was about 11 per cent higher than in October 2007.
These results are based on GfK numbers, which evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolations them on the total market.
To this end, bookings of flights were included, which took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States is mainly requested, the DRV said.
There are about one third of the bookings on these roads.
In addition, in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece and domestic water are particularly targeted.
First of all, organised tours are in course, said DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing energy and food expenditure, the costs are "estimable for the customer for the snake than for the individual organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money can save consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turn will be recorded again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell in comparison to the previous year.
My first Octoberfest
Complete repeated ash, beer from tulips and promenades in hams from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer shop.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator, and she's wearing a tight coat.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer loop, and we're already being hit by photographers and a bunch of memory cards - I'm sorry, because I'm at Octoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap condition has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north from the cobbler, so my sense of comfort in the region was rather limited.
But as soon as I get to Theresienwiese, everything's better than it seemed.
Almost everyone has a woman's coat or leather pants; no one looks down or shy - everything is completely normal.
The special look at the banana stand in the chocolate is just my imagination.
One monk reminds me that I misbehaved with her: "You're free left, in the middle of a lady, on the right, on the back of a widow."
They're pulling their gears from the back to the left.
"All right," he says and laughs.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and they're wearing simple flat hats with the inscription "It's a drink to get dressed!" and they're running around our ass.
A young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies is named Bob, who came from England and came to Octoberfest for the first time.
Looks like he's a gorgeous guy with an extended "oh."
That'll tell me after you've licked your just drunk husband.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everybody thinks they're trash.
Bob is, therefore, one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as the public in Bavaria is said to be free to urinate people.
Others don't have the luck of getting rid of alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, they run across the area where Octoberfest takes place, a bunch of health caretakers who have to take care of the naked drinks.
Health professionals always show up in hens - four wears a covered cloth from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most visitors of the beer loop: empty there, full back.
Whoever's under the flag of this reproach from the past is not seen.
"That's the kind that can't go on anymore," he calls me in answer to my question one of the doctors and disappears in the shower.
Police published the name of the victim of an accident
A name was published for a 30-year-old woman who died in a hospital after she got hit by a car in Essex.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from the darkest Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After the accident, a once-and-forty-year-old man was detained for suspecting an innocent ride.
He's already been released for police bail.
Turkish diplomatic visas are expanding
Long before Turkey began its efforts to join the European Union, it wanted European powers to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a non-renaissance layer.
That's what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits side by side at the end of the platform with towers on each corner facing, in view of the indistinction from some provincial German councillor.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once a man gets his treasure inside, he can't doubt the size of the company whose westernest gate station was.
The station opened the German consortium Anatolisko-Bagdádska Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, which was involved in the game of the empire late, had in mind its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is today Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions broke out during World War I.
Their colleges were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas caused by frozen borders of cold war is gone
The British and colonial units were operating from Egypt and were pressing Turkey and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came to Hydarpash's station.
In 1917 the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its designed roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Ever since then, it's been been being torn apart and surrounded by history.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia continues to serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the growing views of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is gone.
The new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaging.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a cobbled train ride, which recalled the ancient rhythms of a well-known post office document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the movement of a paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, there was a suspect, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the main state of AKP, ultramodern stone and metal buildings, deliberately built in the developing suburb, surrounded half by scattered commercial houses and shops on power where middle managers in commercial clothing - men and women - meet to make early deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central policy from almost every other European political party.
Saka, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
Cold war was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its borders.
He has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But I'm sure there'll be a time," I asked myself, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want such a decision to come."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to said almost remembered: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, follow these courses to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaš station, next most of the night, I thought of the two German men Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were watching this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, from a substantial point of view, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As the guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was concerned about the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded a year on this excellent congregation of young Proteus.
He should have been up to 21 years old, but at the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, some of us were about 30 - we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" represented the will and ability of the congregation to go into any music that was presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiah, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptation created by such a young congregation was often amazing, always exciting and all because of the inspiration of the only man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanged throughout the entire time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The treasurer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was quite clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
No matter where the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Fryn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be matched to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed with any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawed up one or two scattered pecks around the world."
We're gonna miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your neurologist William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's remarks at Beyond Nab End, but that's not exactly what it is.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a British rubber industry.
He actually spent the 1950-51 years in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flemenco and Life," because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was left with simplicity and a strong boost to the audience and consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda's second attack with his bestseller
In November, Honda starts selling the second generation of Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already has a large space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are connected, which increase the comfort of driving and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution is more than a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this single-space vehicle.
You need to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
So the first thing we'll notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time to modernize this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Honda Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda is aiming to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Hondy Jazz in 2007, the estimate in 2009 is estimated to be 100 000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz, which means 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects the sale of 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow the Honduran to significantly reduce the decrease in sales in Spain.
Driving is thus de facto expected to end the year with a total of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared with 1,6 % last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company then expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of his new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-second hybrid of a compact size of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 pieces a year.
As far as markets are concerned, it is estimated that 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The sale of Hondy Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
By contrast, the first generation of the new Jazz has increased all sizes.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), a width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and a repair break to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, hasn't changed. It's still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also led to an increase in internal space.
However, this advantage was achieved by the use of a new platform, but by the storage of fuel tank in the middle of a vehicle already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - also increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of baggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are available in engine 1.4 because the volume of the luggage compartment at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
In addition to external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a glass panoramic roof - it is easier to access the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the angle of opening 80 degrees versus 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
This small model will initially be offered with two gasoline engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and leads to excellent improvement of the propulsion system at the same time as a high torque at full engine speed.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has a power of 90 horses at 6,000 wheels with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 wheels.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions 125 grams of CO2.
Unlike the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto bee" prevents collisions
In order to advance the development of anti-circumvention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time in nature, specifically by the bee.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes it as a model for the flying of the bees, thus preventing collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in prevention technologies of collisions.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in collaboration with the Center for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, director general of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four Nissan security shield zones.
The robot is intended to enhance the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of this mark.
During the summer, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very much like Nissan's safety shield.
However, the most important are complex bee eyes that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
The engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder) when creating this visual function.
It records obstacles up to a distance of two metres in the range of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which will immediately turn it into a warning against collisions.
"When the obstacle is recorded, the robot will resemble the bee moving and will immediately change the direction by turning the circle to the right or even greater angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference in comparison to any existing system is the fact that all manoeuvres are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
The robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction that is allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite amount of directions and possibilities like the bees.
Nissan therefore used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and slowing down to prevent the robot from impacting.
"The device only needs to process information every second and be kept according to these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with only two tons of memory.
You might be surprised, but we're not talking about giga or mega at the memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies immediate prevention of collisions, the technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the creation of a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take a mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the US Ministry of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to deliver the injections, does not lack any invention.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages with banks with questionable solvency, it created a popular-scientific Bad Credit Hotel online game.
It doesn't hurt "The Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a complicated hotel.
The hotel and in particular its reception look cloudy, to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether it's the right time to ask for credit.
And then, above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even though you do not have enough details.
It's a page more suitable for young people than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game is over?
Inside the hotel there will be a dream room.
At least something 'cause I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital MUFG
The bank house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that issues nine billion dollars to earn 21% of its capital, led to a significant decrease in its exchange rate.
A week after the disclosure of their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MUFG is planning to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a single cost of $25,25, representing a total amount of $3 billion.
The current price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
MuFG invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide 10% of its profits and whose exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average uniform price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % at its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock has lost 6.79%, however, and it's worth about $23.07 in Greenwich time.
"This strategic combination is an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding status," explained John Mack, Director General of this American Group.
The new Statute was adopted last week by Morgan Stanley, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities, but it also places him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His association with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis requires the largest Wall Street axis to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it sells up to 20 % of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risk to a minimum and also to cover up."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley’s securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20 %.
The Agreement provides that in a year, the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares, provided that the latter are designated for a certain period of time to be changed at a price of 50 % above the exchange rate, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that will bring the MUG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, increase his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speaking groups refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be proud of Tier One’s payment capacity ratio of around 15 %, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, he had reduced his balance.
The last few weeks were difficult for the group as its stock exchange rate fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payments associated with debt grew rapidly.
These costs took place on Monday, however, they remained high, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" from the big Wall Street investment banks after the crash of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that she had selected $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Re-establish the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominated candidate submitted a proposal for a new Constitution to the vote, in the form of his opponents and friends.
And his mission was completed because 64 % of the voters, according to official results covering 80 % of the votes, voted in the "yes" referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % were invalid and 0,7 % of the ballots were empty.
To be able to accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted in the east of the polling stations and the budgeting of the non-governmental organisation predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with a margin of 63% to 70%.
The rest of the night, on Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution has won the whole series," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers south-west of Quit.
It is understandable to himself that Rafael Correa received commendation from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean opponent, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in peace by the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, dealt with the text on 444 points to be promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy by replacing it with the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the currency sent by its immigrants.
The proposal protected by Correau, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the photograph.
Correa has already announced that this power will be exercised and will be replaced by a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution reaffirms the principle of free health and education, which the president has begun to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts the ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point for US drug operations.
In Chad, 19 prisoners were released
The Egyptian team attacked eleven tourists and their isolated escorts, who were arrested ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were detained in the wilderness for ten days, were transported alive and healthy to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning they released the Egyptian team in Chad.
Handicrafts arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft on the Al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without being able to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, in the district of Cairo, for medical visits.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid for the kidnappings," said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheyr Garran on the road.
Since its capture on 19 September, during the safari in a vehicle with all four rounds at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another 35 unknown kidnappings.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the agency Aegyptous, organizers of safari.
A leading representative of the Egyptian safety components indicated that 30 members of the special units, who approached the site on board two helicopters, went to bed during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half the kidnappings were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the unit "bright" were sent to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian teams.
The chief of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professional and efficient people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied payment of compensation.
On the night before, the Sudanese army declared that the guard had detained the vehicle with all four wheels on board of kidnapping, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander and two arrests.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the above-mentioned movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture is filled with news headlines and is the subject of an election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to cleanse the poor sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memory sites that are starving?
What policy would the federal government call to mind that they remember their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we have no laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on restoring the only Chinon castle in the Valley of Loire?
With our American neighbours it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organisations, in co-operation.
In Quebec, in the Québec Federation of History, at least 40,000 volunteers are involved in 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogies on the discovery of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our memories, which are driven hopelessly protesting when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers to old stones and forgotten graves.
When do we finally wait for the historical and memory forums?
The government of Benelux remains part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux States will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which, as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty because of the widespread effects of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial settlement: three countries will support a monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital share of EUR 11.2 billion in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to participate in the European Central Bank President and European Competition Commissioner.
The Bank of Fortis is the first euro area to have reached a major crisis within the framework of the crisis of international financial markets, which has spread in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this area could be considered as precedents in some respects.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 per cent) of the bank’s domestic assets.
The bank will certainly sell part of its equity holdings, especially – mainly insurance – activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis Bank shares started falling fast last week, in the second half of the week there were serious signs of the crisis already in the constitution.
Analysts agree, however, that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it down.
The company's securities fell only by 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, it is unrealistic according to the company’s leading representatives.
The management of the company is still responsible for the fall of Fortis' insurance shares on the foreign market related to the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the stock has risen slightly.
On Friday, the new Director General Philip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no one had signed up with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to be afraid of losing their money.
The bank's clients haven't panicked yet, and the branches weren't attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Helmet in the cock
Life and health insurance in America based on people's data on the purchase of medicines often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that weighs on the use of drug prescription data in each case for the consent of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust the chicken fox," says Washington Post Richard Dick, author of the program to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the parties and, if the risk is assessed as too large, insurance shall not close it.
They had previously sent them to the medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number, a customer will easily find out what medicines he has bought for the last year and half, from which the program itself produces what he is suffering from the disease and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large quantity of medicines to reduce cholesterol, it refers to having virtually uncontrollable high levels of blood fat, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some also determine the risk factor at the same time, so there is hardly any work left to be done in the insurance sector, except for the paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages are that lacter medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are useful against migraine or heat attacks, but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk-enhancing factor from the commercial perspective, which is not the first-named problem.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, special companies have been set up which require a patient's authorisation before providing the necessary information from the medicinal product.
They're already forcing the authorities, even though they haven't been punished for their past negligence.
Some companies have recently also been processing the results of laboratory tests that link to the data on medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
It has access to data increasingly by companies, while at the same time monitoring their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurance providers.
The proposal for a law which gives the authorities the power to control and companies specialising in the provision of data is before Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: therefore he developed his program in such a way that the processing of data is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permit in question can only make it difficult to resist, otherwise the insurance company will not enter into a contract with him.
So the blind are just a little out on the leaf of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India double the turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this issue has led to other, mainly global problems, also the order of the ninth summit at the highest level.
Today there will also be a French-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but the Member States have so far failed to find a common nominee on the issue of supporting the permanent membership of the New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question has not yet been addressed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that trade would double up to five years or increase to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessive ambition objective.
In this regard, it was legally agreed that there were twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation, so that the Greens were able to enter into future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Dillí is among the EU's partners until the ninth place.
The Summit also paid attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism - both sides in all its forms have condemned and called for an accelerated call for the UN conference.
They also advocated the end of the Dauha trade negotiations, although they both have a large share in his ill health.
The European Union has confirmed that it will last on its energy and climate programme, because it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
It also agreed with India, as well as with the need to conclude a global agreement and production of greenhouse gases to reduce by 50 per cent by 2050 at the next year's climate conference.
Both sides would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is travelling today to the French capital, where he is about to close the trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the commitment to the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion comes from French companies.
According to the Agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the international library fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers participate in the 60th edition of the Bookmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Library Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square metres of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as an honest guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Ponto Italia) – on 264 metres of four exhibition areas.
It will follow the meeting with the press in Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in relation to total Italian production is still reduced, especially in the light of literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossett's plane, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007, was found flying over the desert in Nevada.
The trophies were discovered on one top level at a sea level of three thousand metres, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that it is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying in on the day he disappeared" said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus made it clear that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the identification of the pieces, an investigation team was sent to identify the aircraft: it was precisely Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 September 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal objects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one bundle.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world flew into the plane without landing.
Among his many records are also flights at a height of 15,445 metres, above Andai, although with a copilot.
Glk, ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined definite lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "Compact" Jeeps of the House of the Star by which Mercedes-Benz tried to introduce a faith news into this sector.
Its non-traditional processing will result in unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany the introduction of Suv Glk on the market and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz shows since 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the start of the new vehicle, also launches an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins by presenting a car in a stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real size and in a three-dimensional format.
Really, if you look at the picture, you'll have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its little ones to then recompose into one image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotype area of car communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to awaken the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following Nazionale Azzurra for years and which has, to date, never done any excessive problems.
She never even met the fans of the opponent.
The group's orientation is legal.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Torstou and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-coloured flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: they were removed on Saturday evening so that they were not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all by name, i.e. easy to control.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had their previous stadium offenses were denied entry and the fight was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, and then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during exile.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer step into one stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred fifty are added to them.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who act this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "really open eyes, mainly for national hits on the centre of Leča".
Right in Puglia is the little core of the supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory, on Tuesday, Casms, which can be counted with one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadiums.
"The Congregation Leader-Chairman and the tensioned care during Mameli's gym?"
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very poorly happy way) who is the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (he got a place that was once Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was a former Quaestor in Terst, where the core of the Ultras Italia supporters was founded in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, it's not a crime in Bulgaria to celebrate the leader, but, of course, the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - the Observer Unit delivers - crimes are attributed to the country in which they became.
So far, this group has remained within bounds, and now we're really looking at what happened and we're looking at the future.
But let's also talk about the star at Mameli's hymen: it's not a crime either, but if you'll excuse it, it's an incarceration..."
