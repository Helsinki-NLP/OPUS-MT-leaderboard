During the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020, the overall spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Hemisphere area and Britain increased rapidly during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
In the European Union/Europe, and in Britain, the overall spread of coronary disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends, while in all countries there is an increasing trend based on the global epidemic of COVID-19.
On the basis of Italy's experience, teams from several countries, hospitals and care units need to increase rapidly in COVID-19 patients because they need special care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of examples of unknown materials were reported in the Hobby province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China reported that the major agent Novel Coronnaires is now known as the severe sensitiser syndrome Coronnaires-2 (SARS-COV-2).
However, the disease caused by the invasion of SARS-COV-2 has been named Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, the evidence of the history of COVID-19 is that there is a slight convulsions of respiratory disease in the number of people with COVID-19, with or without it, and most of them are found to be healthy.
Approximately 14% of cases are more serious in the form of COVID-19, which requires hospital entry, while %6 cases require extreme care for patients with severe disease.
The rate of admission to the hospital is about 4% due to COVID-19.
In this study, we will identify differences in the overall spread of COVID-19 in every country in the European Union/EU/EEA and in the UK, and will compare them with China.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and Britain from January 31st to March 15th, 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain
After China, COVID-19 has been increasingly widespread, and the world's global epidemic of COVID-19 is now according to the same country.
The World Health Agency (WHO) Director General appointed COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 as a global cure.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Euro Service, Espritri Et Al reported on the first European-approved COVID-19 cases, according to WHO's case report.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported by three French returnees from Hobby on 24 January 2020.
By 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and Britain (UK) I had received information about COVID-19 cases, under which 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported in Italy only since 31 December 2019.
Total data and distribution of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) for Disease Prevention (COVID-19) is the only source of data available in all countries, including government resources, national and regional health authorities, and the World Health Organization.
They were used to examine and compare COVID-19 conflicts in the EU/EEA and Britain.
As an extension of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the overall distribution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19.
From January 31st to March 15, 2020, we compared Italy with Italy by 8 p.m. on March 15, 2020.
EU/EEA countries and Britain's COVID-19 restrictions
In general, the overall distribution of 14 days of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and Britain is according to the province of Hobby (Chang 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and Britain, the overall spread of COVID-19 was increased on 21 February, and then increased rapidly on 28 February 2020.
This was due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported by most Italians, but the overall distribution of COVID-19 in all EU/EEA countries and Britain has thus shown an increasing trend.
The total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and Britain has been shown to be compared with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It was pointed out that, as of 15 March at 8:00 p.m., only 3 weeks before or less before, Italy reported the total number of other 15 EU/EEA countries and Britain.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 reported in the EU/EEA and Britain is increasing rapidly.
Globalization of COVID-19 shows that this worldwide plague is increasing at an alarming rate in all countries.
While countries are in different stages, there is a need to check for changes in the response to the national health system and possibly for different praise and patient selection protocols to verify the COVID-19.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from affected areas in Italy reported a situation where COVID-19 had to care for about %10 patients and the media reported that hospitals and care units in these areas had already reached more of their capacity.
Currently at EU/EEA level, there are data and data on the entries of COVID-19 in any hospital and/or care unit for cases of malformation at the EU/EEA level of %6 and %1 (no data shown).
However, current surveillance data, including the completion of cases and deaths reported, should be collected in an orderly manner.
A study conducted in 2010-11 shows that in Europe there has been a significant change in the availability of beds in Germany 29.2 and in Portugal from 10.000 in every population to 4.2 beds.
This means that there will be fewer and more resources in these countries (in 11-2010 there are 12.5 beds for every 100,000 population).
A model approach to health care enhancement, the estimates of cases of COVID-19 entering every EU/EEA country and Britain that are more than 90% of those who are in excess of the quality of the bees of extreme care, have been provided on the ECDC's high-speed diagnosis on COVID-19.
Since EU/EEA countries and particular areas of Britain still have cassavas, and the United States of America generally explain the population of the local map of hospitals and highly supervised units, the priority data and NUTS-2 data on beds of extreme custody provide easy access to the available number service available to local authorities.
Current trends in Italy and other countries show that the global scourge of COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Countries, hospitals and care units need to prepare themselves for the permanent transfer of SARS-COV-2 to the community, and the increase of patients in COVID-19, like affected areas in Italy, needs special care.
As the current ECDC rapid alert, I have a quick, active and common point of view that is needed to delay the extension of SARS-COV-2, which requires a change from the stopping point of view, if it is not implemented before the time comes, then the expected number of rapid decision-making and hospitalizations cannot provide enough time to understand, admit and deal with their reaction.
The rapid diagnosis includes a list of health measures to reduce the effects of global disease.
There is a small opportunity here, during which countries are more likely to reduce the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care providers in their efforts to reduce their control.
Failure in this, it is likely that health care providers in EU/EEA countries will need to be given extra care in the coming days or weeks.
Because of the spread of the most severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 3,000 deaths in China and the world and more than 80,000 people, resulting in destruction for humans.
Like its homelogous virus SARS-Cov, which caused thousands of SARS in 2003, so can SARS-COV-2 also spread because of light bulbs, and the same symptoms are caused by such mechanics.
However, as opposed to SARS, COVID-19 has fewer severe and low rates of death, but it affects women more than young people and men.
In response to the increasing number of reports of developing diseases, this article seeks to present a timely and peer review of the rapidly growing research article.
We're going to include the basics about diseases, virology, antibiotics, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review will help us to understand this dangerous disease and its end
On 25 January 2020, the May Day festival for all Chinese people was an unparalleled and unimaginable reminder of the fact that the Novel Wirell disease was spreading and encouraging to live in homes for several weeks.
This virus is a very homologous virus with the cov, which caused the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WH) on 11 February 2020, and its associated disease COV-19 (COVID-19).
This began from the city of Wawan in China and spread rapidly throughout the country and the world across about 50 other countries.
By April 2, 2020, 40,000 patients were diagnosed with virus and 3,000 deaths with more than 80,000 COVID-19 deaths.
WHO reported that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy" and is more powerful than terror.
According to Pep Med (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), COVID-19, which, after its first report on 7 January 2020, includes virallogy, bypass, equipment, treatment and diagnosis and which has assigned several patients to be separated, but more than 200 cases have been reported.
This review has sought to review creative progress in the area of new and rapidly advanced topics.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another COV in the Middle East.
We'll talk about some important issues, along with what we've learned about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease.
Traditionally for humans, COV has been considered non-major pathogens, mainly due to approximately %15 of general N°4.
However, in this century, two extremes of CoV, the SARS CoV and the MERS-COV, who created this disease in China and Saudi Arabia in early 2003, and soon it spread with its death rates in many other countries.
So the current COVID-19 is COVK's third plague in record history.
As shown in the figure, figure 1.1, was first reported by the Chinese National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the order of the CoV was arranged.
On January 15, 2020, what was Levi's first life in Wawan.
The doors were spread out in cities, suburbs, and countries.
On January 20, an infestation was reported among healthcare professionals, which meant that he could be transferred from human to human.
On January 23rd, he was awarded lockdown by closing all public transfers in Wahan City.
On 24 January, a first medical study of this disease revealed that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had access to the market for marine food, which is thought to be the starting point for this infection by some unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO made this disease a state of health at the global level.
By the time this report came, the disease had already spread to all the countries around the world and around 50 countries.
Because the situation is getting fast, the ultimate capacity and strength of this plague remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, reported another recent explanation of this disease in a multidisciplinary study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 affects all ages, but especially those aged 65-30.
About half of the affected were over 50 years of age, under 20 years of age and only 14 affected under 10 years of age.
SARS -COV-2 has affected more men than women (0.27/100,000) (0.31/10,000)
COVID-19 was mainly widespread in Hobby and its surrounding areas.
COVID-19 was an average of 5 (9-2) days from the beginning.
The average duration of the sample was 4.8 ( 3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the beginning to the end was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic told number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to a large number of migrations in China prior to May, the number of affected persons increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The rate of death of confirmed case patients was %1.44 (%95 Cl: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted rate of death of all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major dangerous elements of COVID-19 are men, age (≥60), and there were many examples.
CoVs is a large and mild virus, which contains only a trace of the RNA of the resin, the lower family.
They are divided into four generations: Alpha, BTA, Gama, and Delta, from which Alpha and BTA are known to influence the CoVs.
Milf Spic (S) glycoprotein binds to SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, which converts the cellular receptor into enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptidedyl peptide 4 (DPP4).
The viral genes are transferred to the plasma site, and then the viral genes are replaced by the gluco-Lamith and the neo-Clio-Casidevirn, which then form the faeces to leave the virus with plasma.
The first GNOME version of SARS-COV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
There were more than 99.98 examples of a new type of SARS-COV-2 genetic identification of BTA from the original site of the marine food market.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2,MERS-COV is greater than SARS-COV
As a result of the transfer of electric microscopes, SARS -COV-2 is located on the very tip of the human breath nebula.
Human ACE2 has been found not only for SARS-COV-2 but also for SARS-COV
However, SARS-COV-2 is more weak than SARS-COV-2, which is linked to human ACE2, which is in fact consistent with SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2, which causes less infection.
SARS-COV-2 can also generate coded new shortcuts through orf3b and hidden ones through orf8.
SARS-COV-2 orf3b can play its role in the viral pathogen and in IFNB, but no known active domain or form of orf8 is available.
On 18 February 2020, Ziva et al., with Amino Asd Transporter B0AT1, reported a complex decision in the full length of human ACE2 in 2.9 Å islands in the cover of EM.
He found that the complexity, in which the open and closed changes were collected as a diameter, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity can be prevented by two S-limates, which can provide evidence of COV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for screening medications to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Original and Duchy maintainer
It's known that SARS-CoVuer MERS-COV, starting with two light bulbs, has moved into humans through seat belts and camels.
By comparing SARS-COV-2 with other CoVs, the lamp is considered to be the local representative of SARS-COV-2, because the new virus %96 is like two SARS-like CoVs beta-SL-COVZX45 and beta-SL-COVZX21.
However, it has not yet been possible to determine which intermediary has helped to overcome obstacles to influence people, and at the same time cannot explain the route of movement.
J, Y, Y, Al, proposed snakes from light bulbs to humans as a cure for virus disease, which includes homeology within SB proteins.
In Guangjang, China, researchers have suggested that long-lasting penguins used in traditional Chinese medicine, corneas, pegulins, and SARS-COV-2 can be represented through the potential between SARS-COV-2 and %99 genetics.
However, the difference in distribution in two GNOMEs is still very different, so wait for the final results of the witness (schol.33).
Most of SARS-COV-2's physical properties are still unknown
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVjo can survive for less than 40 % to 50 % in the dry environment for 48 hours and less than 20 ° degrees centigrade.
SARS-COV-2 has the same characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 is sensitive to unsaturated cracks, and up to 30 minutes from the temperature of 56° centigrade, or then %75 hetol, including the disinfectant on chlorine, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fete-creative strains, but chloricsidin cannot be deactivated in a large way.
In general, there is a barrier to force resistance for SARS-COV-2 in the entire human population, and that's why they're infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the anti-SARS-COV-2 response has been reported.
So, we can refer to other CoVs in particular about SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV past studies (schol.4).
When a representative is attacked by a virus, the anti-infectious system of this representative is identified by the first type of receiver (PRRs), which includes Lectonic Receptors, Total Receptors (TLR), Ned Receptors (NLR) and RIG-I Receptors (RLR).
In various ways, the design of the common virus sousch, the development of dendrite cells, and the number I enter Pharaoh (IFNs), which restricts the spread of the virus and encourages the acceleration of the viral resistance genes of the microphyg Phositovis.
However, SARS-COV's NLH can help prevent anti-response viruses
Soon, according to the anti-virus response, the fight will be fought.
In defense of helmets, T lymphatics play an important role in +CD4 and +CD8.
The T roofs of +CD4 encourage B roofs and the T roofs of +CD8 directly destroy the cells affected by the right virus to create a specific anti-virus body.
T assistants prepare pro-susch sites to help defense cells.
However, COV can prevent the activity of the T roofs by placing the roofs on the aputis.
Hormonal force resistance, including C3a and C5a, and antibody supplements, are needed to combat viral infection.
For example, MERS-COV is not affected by an anti-body separated from a healthy patient.
On the other hand, because of the abuse of the power system, there are many free radicals locally that can harm bats and other members, and the worst situation is to stop many members and even die.
SARS-COV-2 infection is evident from the beginning of clausting, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common for people who have two or four viruses in large numbers, or whose counter-activities are weak, to be more likely to be affected than others.
On the basis of a study of the first 425 cases, the average duration of the sample of SARS-COV-2 is 14-1 days, more than 7-3 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average growth period is 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study shows that 8,866 cases were 4,8 (3.0-7.2) days of growth.
Health authorities need to set a high time for the quarantine on the basis of the most accurate sampling period so that people who are affected but do not have signs can be protected from virus transmission.
Generally, infected or affected persons need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the time of Corinth be increased to 24 days?
Most COVID-19 has an important and initial sign with no other sign or other signs, such as dry food, breathing pain, back pain, roundness, headache, throat, chest pain, ash, itching, itching, itching and itching.
Some patients have to cope with breathing and/ or seizures a week after the onset of the disease
In severe cases, the patient’s immune system, the sudden improvement in septic attacks, metabolic rate, and accumulation are rapidly improving.
Signs and/ or symptoms of breath and severe tastes, as well as testing for the initial diagnosis of patients with normal pneumonary egregation.
At the end of December 2019, a population study found that %98 cows, %76 dry meats, %55 sneezing, and %8 of the patients with signs of asthma require ventilation.
In two recent studies, a similar result has been found in the transfer of the family to a non-significant person due to a stroke.
In contrast, a 2012 study revealed that there were also major signs of dry food in patients with MERS-COV (98), and respiratory failure (55).
However, %80 of them needed ventilation assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS was more advanced than COVID-19.
In patients with MRS, there were also seizures (26) and sore throats (%21).
It has been shown that in SARS patients, there are also signs (100-99 percent), dry food (75-29 percent), breath (42-40 percent), ashil (25-20 percent) and throat (25-13 percent), and about 20-14 percent of patients needed help in the exercise.
Until February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 at the world level, COVID-19 was the death rate of %2.
By contrast, SARS confirmed that the death rate was %10 in 8,096 by November 2002.
On the basis of a population study in June 2012, the number of deaths confirmed by MERS was %37.
In a previous study, it was reported that the confidence interval (CI) of 571-7.23 % of SARS-COV-2 was greater than 6.47, while the confidence interval of the SARS-COV-2 was limited to 2 or 4.
This entry compares the signs, death rates and toll numbers with SARS-COV-2 with SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
The data above shows that there is a greater capacity to spread than the MRS-COV and SARS-COV in SARS-COV-2, but it is less than two viruses later.
So it's more difficult to control SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
Most of the jams begin with a single family or a single assembly or a sea-going ship.
Most patients have a history of travel or residence or contact with people or patients during the past two weeks or other affected areas.
However, it has been reported that people can keep this virus inside for two weeks without showing signs, and patients who have been hospitalized can recapture the virus, which takes hours to increase the time of quarantine.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be less than or equal to the original level (especially lymphoids).
For example, the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L contains the number of lymphocyte sites < 1×109/L, and the level and hermia of sprite aminotransfers were found in COVID-19 patients.
Some patients' brains and backs increased in the levels of vomiting and blood in the meglobin, and most patients had increased C-inactive anaemia and Ettrovisit cough.
In severe case patients, D-dimer, a decrease in faurbon, has been increased, and the number of lymph nodes has gradually decreased.
COVID-19 patients have two sides of complex shadow or ground-glazed paper on conventional radiography against the radiography of the breast of the chest.
In most patients, general exasperation, severe fluctuations, severe respiratory failure (ARDS) syndrome occurs.
Inhaling unsanitary syndrome, uncontrolled suction, accumulation of raw material, and increasing in the exchange of fibrosis gases
Disabling Type I and Type II mutations reduces the level of the head factor and increases the level of uptake, thus reducing the risk of spreading and failure
So, the consequences of sine's worst radiography are very similar to the limit of the disease.
On 18 February, 2020, like SARS and MRS patients, and according to the pathology of ARDS and viral infection, the pathological evaluation of the disease in the early pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the emergence of neurosites, hallucinations, and intermediate lymphocytes, and multiplicity-senistal glands in the outbreaks of the disease.
It was important to use the RNA of SARS-COV-2 to define COVID-19 as a RNA response (RT-PCR).
In China, on 13 February 2020, because of the higher incidence of negative lies, which can speed up the plague, the use of medical data and data for diagnosis (which is no longer entirely based on RT-PCR) has begun.
The same was true of SARS.
So, for a major diagnosis, in the history of disease, medical examinations, library testing, and radiological results all need to be
On 14 February, 2020, the Fing Zhanging Group outlined a protocol to use CRISPR-based satellite technology, which will use 20x10-18 microliter/liter of 200x10-18 microliter (a 100-10 copy of a microliter) in order to provide 20x10-18 microliters of RNA, which will be used within less than an hour without the need for any tools.
It is hoped that, if confirmed in medical examples, new technical sensitivity and ease will increase the drama.
Because of the lack of experience with Novel CoV, treatments can primarily provide care to patients with COVID-19, while they are also trying different treatments that have previously been recommended or used for treatment in other diseases such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Gidel2).
These treatments include modern and possibly antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, healthy patients, Chinese drugs, and psychological assistance.
Even healthy or healthy patients were recommended to use plasma for treatment.
The drug companies are in a race to prepare antibodies and vaccines against the virus
In the beginning, SARS-COV-2 basically attacks the bubbles, and perhaps it attacks other ACE2-expressing members like the hips and rounds.
Of course, the destruction of breath and the failure of flies are the greatest danger and cause of death for the patient.
So, to help preserve the signs and lives, it includes general oxygen, high-speed oxygen, bad interference ventilation and mechanical interference ventilation.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system through the Paltu Corporal Oxygen (ECMO) are required to assist with the use of modified cardo-pluminary bypass techniques to treat the risk of heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, for the maintenance of electric lights, secondary infection and septic infection treatment and prevention are necessary in patients with SARS-COV-2.
This is said to be due to an abuse of the immune system in SARS and MERS.
The site from which the stream is organized is a sort of Soviet reaction that comes from one of the site's most recent performances, including TNFa, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNv, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
A large number of free radicals, which are a major cause of severe pain syndrome and the failure of various members, include anti-inflammatory cells to continue.
The site from the stream, especially in severely ill patients, requires immunosuppression.
The site has been used to treat the current of Kurtico Star Andes and toto Cizizomabak Anti IL6 Molecular Anti Body.
Site from which to suppress other resistance to the stream; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF have been restricted; JAK has been prevented; movement pressure 4; and HADC has been modified by T-cells that prevent anti-reaction.
In SARS, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants to reduce the amount of soybean damage.
However, in SARS and COVID-19 patients, steroids had no significant benefit in the disease of outbreaks.
Instead, it can cause severe congestive effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis affects the characterisation of the dramatic
However, severe patients with COVID-19 have been advised to use short-term short-term courses of corticosteroid diet.
Recent writing, no major antiviral treatment has yet been confirmed.
However, with Tek Remittsore in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, Nicole Tide Ana Log was found to be successful.
Remitsoir is a new antiviral medicine that originally prepared a Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marbler.
Later, Remitsoir was potentially restricted to arresting RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
On the basis of this, Gilead provided a high-end China to a couple of people affected by SARS-COV-2, whose results are far more than expected.
In addition, Barisetinb, Interferon-a, Lopinaner/Retunier, and Ravieran have been proposed for possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory pain.
In combination with lupininar/ritovier, the treatment may be associated with liver damage and other negative reactions.
The combination should be monitored with other medicinal products used in patients.
Plasma from healthy patients and antibody strains
It is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have been treated with this disease to protect other patients or health professionals.
In fact, many of the patients who have been treated have relatively higher levels of antibodies against the pathogens in their blood.
Anti-Body is an immunoglobulin (Ig) that, through B Lemo Pythons, helps to fight pituitary genes and other external objects and to identify individual molecules on the pituitary glands and to directly eliminate them.
Based on this, plasma from the blood of patients treated with COVID-19 was collected and entered into 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms, such as suction and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood, improve within 24 hours.
However, no specific treatment has yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before proposing to use it on a large scale.
In addition, with regard to the effects of treatment, some plasma-related damage should be considered.
For example, the Anti-Body Corporation is increasing anti-resistance, and the site may be the cause of their payout syndrome, which is possibly life-threatening.
The number of antibodies in the blood is generally reduced, and the demand for plasma for treatment for very sick patients is increased.
It is difficult to prepare the particular ante body so quickly to fight the worldwide plague.
To separate B cells from healthy patients and to encode powerful resistance to the identification of genetic code against the virus's required anti-inflammatory activity is a subtle and difficult action to screen the large anti-inflammatory body.
So we can speed up the preparation of the anti-body.
Traditional Chinese medicine is being used for treatment of various diseases for thousands of years in China
However, its effects depend largely on a formula based on a number of factors, which are based on traditional Chinese medicine ideas based on the diagnosis of a disease.
Many major components are unknown or missing because it is difficult to extract and confirm such components or their best collection
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment of COVID-19, moderately good symptoms or patients who have been severely cured have become an important alternative to traditional Chinese medicine.
For example, COVID-19 has been shown to be a living cell of FINJ LOU CAPSOL and Le HUNGING CHANGWIN CAPSOL.
In a number of areas in China, patients with COVID-19, including ginsou, (63.7 per cent) and Hannan (50 per cent) saw a high rate of improvement in treatment for their patients using 87 per cent of traditional Chinese medicine, while Hobby, who used only 30 per cent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of health or health (13 per cent).
However, this is a very severe comparison, such as the number and severity of patients such as many other patients in this assessment.
On 18 February, 2020, Speak Jung and his associates published a study comparing Western Drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicine (WM).
They found that only against the Western drug group was the duration of the physical recovery of fever, the end of symptoms, and the duration of hospital stay, beyond the time required.
In what way, the significantly increasing sign (from light to light) compared to the WM+TCM group was only limited to the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the death rate (8.8% versus 39%) was unusually low.
Of course, traditional Chinese medicine is still on a large scale and is waiting for better and more control tests to work and protect.
It will be interesting to explain how traditional Chinese medicines are used, their major components, or, if possible, their collection.
Because of COVID-19, confirmed patients are more likely to experience extreme stress and even fear of mental illness, and the Corinthians have to face bitterness, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, symptoms of infection, such as fever, strokes, and depression, can lead to negative effects of treatment due to carticoids, such as insomnia, insomnia, and mental recovery.
In the early stages of SARS, there have been reports of constant mental depression, insomnia, attacks of fear, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, depression, and self-esteem.
Contacting and corthening people as part of the health community related to the disease of COVID-19 can make people more restless and guilty about the effects of corthening and mental illness on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, experienced people, should provide mental health care to those who are in contact with them.
The position of multi-disciplinary mental health teams, SARS-COV-2's disease and its treatment plans, and the need to stand up with clear initiatives to avoid contact with each other with regard to the use of advanced electronic tools and appeals cases.
Animals, and affected people, need to have a major vaccine to prevent movement into sensitive individuals, and many antiviral treatments are needed to control the virus.
Long-term and vetent neutralising anti-SARS efforts have been made to develop anti-SARs-based vaccines and/or anti-SARs-based vaccines.
For SARS, animal samples were evaluated directly for the direct effect of vaccines.
However, it is not possible to identify the future of the vaccine in order to protect the old people, the examples of domestic challenges, and the infection of the virus against animals before medical examination.
That's because 17 years ago SARS was gone and she hasn't had a new case report yet.
On the other hand, in other letters, other than the Middle East, where there are permanent media areas of animal viruses, I'm still on the market for rescue.
Disabling the virus, using plasmas of DNA, viral vectors, neo-teeth, and sub-units of viruses detected and detected, has been developed with the practical wisdom of the survival vaccine against MERS, and some of them have been tested for animal samples.
For non-reliable people, the immediate and important task is to manage the preparation of many vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
However, the preparation of the vaccine and the need for a longer (average 18 months) period for the movement of CoVs is a challenge to overcome this challenge.
COVID-19 has started to show its medical course in thousands of patients as novell disease
In most cases, patients may get a little bit of health without anything.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with more disease and deaths in patients with severe seizures.
Therefore, health care agencies need to set up a diagnostic model of disease in order to prefer their services in less resourced areas
Based on the medical studies currently reported, the following normal COVID-19 patients may be associated with or influenced by their characteristics (Gedul (Gedul 33).
Age: SARS was the most important age element to identify, which is now also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mainly born to 65-30-year-olds, of whom 8,866 patients were 47.7% above 50 years of age.
The patients in which the main cause is the primary cause of the incidence of RABs are more obese, and are older than those in whom there are no such incidences (other than the median age of 66 years) and who provide age for the COVID-19 patients as a diagnostic measure.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-COV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).
We're doing some research and research: the patients in COVID-19 who need a lot of care are at risk of heart and breath.
In SARS patients, heart events are the most important cause of death.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 may also be associated with a positive ACE2 chulnosis, which can cause brain damage in patients with COVID-19
It can be said that age and basic disease are closely linked and they can interact with each other.
Extraordinary laboratory results: The level of C reactive activity in the blood (CRP) reflects the severity of the injury of Sosh or Tsho and has been proposed as possible analytical action for the treatment of the disease and for the end of the disease.
COVID-19 has been recommended for intensity and specification of C-reactive activity levels
In addition, the Elite Lexate De Hydro Gens (LDH), Exprite Immunity (AST), Ela Nain Amino Transference (ALT), and the Cretan Cons can also help predict the results
The expression of these crimes occurs in a number of members, especially in the heart and brain, and they are caused by damage to the tissue.
So they stop the traditional target of heart or brain damage.
Important Medical Signs: To present the results and complications of COVID-19, you need to consider combining the temporary improvement of breast radiography and medical symptoms with other touchos.
Use of Streids: As mentioned above, the use of Streids to reduce the amount of damage caused by strikes is generally used to reduce the resistance of Streids as an adjuvant treatment.
Since a large amount of Carteco steroid was used in severe SARS patients, many survivors had to cope with a life-long disability and disability.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used for a very short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental disorders: As mentioned above, many patients were suffering from COVID-19, long-term quarantine, and the unreasonable death of close relatives and fellow patients.
Personal advice and long-term assistance are needed to bring these patients back to normal life.
According to the population studies conducted so far, the underlying characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS
In addition to applying SARS-COV-2 to the lower respiratory tract, the upper respiratory tract can also be applied to the upper respiratory tract, and in the early stages of the infection, other coVs cause mild or no symptoms such as colds caused by other coVs.
So, in the early stages or during the sampling period, patients who are affected may develop a large amount of virus during daytime activities, which makes it very difficult to control the disease.
However, SARS-CoVki is weak when his disease is very ill, while it is not too late in the early stages.
Thus, COVID-19's current disease is more severe than SARS is and is difficult to control.
Meanwhile, in China, Wahan and the surrounding cities of Lake Dawn and the entire population continue to have hopes and efforts to create a barrier to the movement of SARS -COV-2.
Although these measures are dramaticly damaging to the country's economy and other areas, it is reducing the number of new patients, which is a sign of slowing down of the plague.
The best thing about it is that his father will be in the end of March and his daughter will be in the range of 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which is more chronic than SARS, will not be at the end of 2020.
Aira Long et al., suggested that a model to predict the effects of global plague could affect two-thirds of the world's population, Sars-COV-2.
A group in Canada reported that two weeks ago, a group of patients who had been diagnosed with the disease from the hospital found that they were affected by SARS-COV-2, which shows that the new identified virus infection could be severe.
However, on the basis of the decrease in the number of new cases, there are additional signs of hope in China, which indicate that current wisdom is working.
In fact, half a million deaths were presented in Ebola with a million cases.
However, through strong cortex and loneliness, this disease has finally been overcome.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-COV-2 may also be weak in spreading the affected disease and eventually disappear or be present with humans like a low disease virus.
The following is a comparison with SARS and MERS (55) of COVID-19 plague.
SARS-COV-2 is transferred directly from the virus contaminated and possibly directly through direct communication.
This virus is also found in a pouch, which creates a new possibility of movement from the pouch to the mouth.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41 percent of cases were previously responsible for non-communicable infections involving 17 patients and 40 patients with pre-existing disease.
So, people, especially health care providers, social workers, housewives, colleagues and even those who are in contact with patients or affected people, should be very careful.
In order to reduce the risk of infection, masks on the first hard face of the defense are worn; both surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (serage # 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Hurricane masks prevent them from traveling through the wind through possible impactors or on the surface of the ocean, from where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (1860) Moscow can save from breathing from 10 nm to 80 small viruses. Zero 5 percent of viruses can enter completely. SARS-COV-2 sizes are like SARS-COV, both are approximately 85 nm.
Although five wounds can be combined, this can enter them, so patients who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Cyril #1860s) masks instead of a surgical mask.
In addition to the masks, health care professionals need to wear a live cow to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect someone through the eyes.
On 22 January, 2020, a Dr. SARS-COV-2 was affected, while he had to wear N95 masks; the virus came in from his troubled eyes.
Therefore, health care professionals should wear clean blankets or a fountain when working with patients.
For affected or possibly affected communities, this is the best advice for people to wash their hands more often than just soap, try to take themselves into the home, and limit contact with potentially affected people.
The patient is estimated to be three feet long.
These are effective ways to prevent the spread of viruses and reduce the risk of active infection.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus in the human world, according to the report of 7 January 2020, SARS-COV is the highest species, and China should be responsible for the high-altitude of SARS in 2003.
However, on 19 January, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control told citizens that the New Virus has little or no potential in humans, and that it is no problem to prevent and control this disease.
This message reassured the public's alarm, especially when they were preparing for the summer holiday, and the time to overcome this disease was less than the size of the wave.
Sickness agencies in China may have improved in the future by learning from this problem.
For example, these agencies should be careful (1) when making public statements as if every word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) instead of waiting for the official reports of doctors or workers, the clinic is sensitive to and able to react to the basic information of the patient; (3) not to give comfort to the public, but to prevent control in its early stages; and (4) to increase public awareness of diseases and occasionally to check the social response system and to use targeted and effective exercises to improve it.
The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019 with the new virus SARS-COV-2.
In short, it has spread in less than two months, across China and around 50 other countries.
Since the virus connects with SARS-COV and there are signs between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-expanding of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects more men and women than young people, and the number and death rates of young people are higher than those of young people.
SARS rates are higher than COVID-19 (%1.91).
COVID-19 patients can still transfer viruses when there are no signs in them when SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This occasionally explains why SARS-COV-2 relatively spreads faster and wider than SARS-COV
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA may be negative for SARS-COV-2
Otherwise, the virus can be positive again in healthy patients.
These results increase the risk of virus spread in a dramatic manner.
In COVID-19, there is still a solution to many important problems, such as the following:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although SARS-COV-2 and two bits of SARS-Pro, among the CoV, 96 percent of the genetics we've found, yet we can't conclude that SARS-COV-2 came from light bulbs.
The real representatives, the lighthouse, who was passing through the transmission of the virus into humans?
Without answering #1 and 2, we can't significantly reduce the movement and it can spread again at any time.
Although the test of saline models and biochemicals shows that SARS-COV-2 is related to this ACE2, how does this virus enter the cells of the breath channel and how does it result in pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with cells expressing ACE2 in another member?
Without the right answers to these questions, we can't get fast and correct diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this plague continue?
How does the virus get emotionally ready during the transfer to humans?
Will it become a global scourge, will it end like SARS or will it increase time like damage?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions
However, whatever expenditure we have on it, we have no choice but to stop this disease quickly and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal Source of Human Coronation Viruses
For thousands of years, changes and adjustments, including humans, corona viruses (COVs) and their host animals have advanced each other's progress
Prior to 2003, two human-made viruses (HCoVs) were known for a minor disease such as common cold.
The SARS and the Middle East respiratory system (MERS) have shown that HCV infection can be devastating and life-threatening.
At the end of 2019, the explosion of SARS-COV-2 in Central China again highlighted the CoVs and surprised us with its rapid migration towards SARS-COV and the decrease in the pathogenesis.
HCOV infestation is a human transfer infection and it serves us to understand the source of HCOV in animals.
Most of the HCVs started with light bulbs where they are non-pathogenic.
Some of the HCOV's stores also know the host animals.
Identifying the host animals that are directly affected by human diseases.
Animal studies of COV-host animals have shown that humans are aware of the pathogens of COV
In this review, we present a review of the knowledge about the seven HCVs, in which we focus on the sources and the mixed transport of their animals, along with their history of surveying.
The important thing is, from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and their regeneration, we are comparing and distinguishing different HCVs.
The current COV disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be discussed in this context.
In addition, the association of successful host animals to protect against the demands of changes and the severity of the virus has been highlighted
Coronnaires (CoVs) is related to the Coronariadi family, which includes a group of the only RNA viruses that have been captured.
These viruses, which use large genes such as 26 to 32 kilo bass between RNA viruses, were called "COV" due to the presence of crowns such as morefology from the electric microscope.
In fact, CoVs have different genres that are part of a similar organization.
In about two thirds of the generations, there are two large riding frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the form of polystyrene of pp1a and pp1ab.
It's a multi-layered, 16 non-constructive, sealed, nsp1~16.
The rest of the genera are mixed with ORFs, including employers, employees, etc.
A large number of special aid units are also encoded using different types of COVs.
According to Lahemia, the four strains of CoVs (alpha-Cov, bta-Cov, gamma-Cov and delta-Cov) are closed, including more than one Bta-Cov in HCVs and are divided into more (A,B,C and D)
The testimony of the Faelo Genieties shows that the most lighthouses and the fourth alpha-COV and bta-COV genes are the most valuable birds in Gama-COV and Delta-COV.
For thousands of years, CoVs has been constantly overcoming various kinds of obstacles, and some of them have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have known.
These include HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 alpha-CoVs
Other five children -CoVs in HCV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, include severe breathing syndrome (SARS-CoV), East Central Transfusing Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are generally due to symptoms such as mild cold and/or asthma.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and newly identified SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogens, which can lead to severe respiratory distress syndrome (RD) in relatively more patients and an increased likelihood of extrapplelonary depressions due to the infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract.
By the mid-1960s, B814 had isolated HCOV-229E from normal cold patients.
Since then, more information has been gathered through extensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which are due to self-restraint symptoms.
In fact, before SARS spread, the idea was widely accepted that infection with HCVs is generally harmless.
The most devastating event in the current SARS web history in 2003, which affected more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% of deaths.
Ten years later, as a result of the spread of the Osnagas Syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East, the island of Osnabas has been spreading continuously throughout the world.
Nov 2019 (HCoV (2019-nCoV, later known as SARS-COV-2), is a major agent of corona virus disease (COVID-19) since 2019, which killed more than 3,120 lives by March 3, 2020 and affected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm is ringing, and the world's coming will have to prepare for SARS-COV-2.
All seven HCOVs are pets, pets or pets.
The number of lines of evidence supports the evolution of all HCVs from the very beginning, where viruses are well adapted and non-fatal genes express the superior genetic inflow.
COVID-19 has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world
The introduction of HCOVs' source animals provides a framework for understanding the nature of natural history, the power of spread and the prohibition of transfer in different types.
It may also help or guide the search for hosts of SARA-COV-2, mid- and farmed animals with important involvement in preventing future recurrences.
In this review, we will present a review of the source animals, the mixed transport and the pathogens of HCOVs.
In particular, we ignore this idea and think about it as a substitute for the fact that HCOVs' fatherly viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their natural resources and the pathogens become genes after their transfer to their new host.
We're also looking into the trend of HCOVs, in which most of them would have increased mobility with fewer in the petio gin.
This survey also considered a change in the results of the continuation of SARS-COV-2.
At the end of the 1930s, the COVs of the animals went
The HCOV-229E strain was separated from B814 prior to the release of HCOV-229E, before the use of a substance from the nose of patients with normal cold, affected by various COVs, including turgid, cattle, sur, bali, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
According to the historical order, the HCOVs survey date (Gedul 1) will be a brief summary of information and teaching.
In 1966, HCOV-229E was removed before the respiratory tract of patients infected by the upper Nile, and was later used to increase the cells of the WI-38 bats.
In HCOV-229E, between 10 and 20 percent of patients affected have experienced simple colds, including headaches, strokes, restlessness, and nausea.
Since 1967, HCOV-OC43 has been separated from the member's culture and has been later placed on the path of the tiny dogs' brain.
The medical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of people who have been exposed to HCV-229E, who are not symbolically different from those of other respiratory neils, such as infectious A viruses and pathogens.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are divided on both global levels, and these are more and more abundant in the cooler waters during the winter.
Usually, the sample of these two viruses is less than a week, and then it's going to be sick for about 2 weeks.
According to human volunteer studies, exposure to HCOV-229E by healthy people results in a simple cold.
Only a few of the patients who understand the resistance are exposed to severe infections of the lower part of the pancreas.
SARS, also called "a general model", was first documented as a worldwide disease due to HCOV in human history and SARS-COV is an ethological agent, the third HCOV being identified.
The first case of SARS can be placed in the Djiang Dong district of China at the end of 2002.
SARS's disease, which resulted in the spread of 774 deaths in many countries and continents, resulted in 8,096 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4-7 days and a viral load limit of 10 days, could increase about two secondary cases.
In SARS-COV affected patients, there are first signs of pain, coldness, coldness, restlessness and coldness in the back, then symptoms of severe self-suffering, nausea, and shortness of breath.
Lympho Pania, an unusual laboratory test of SARS, is a simple addition to the unordered design of the liver and some high-creatinine glands.
In SARS patients, the spread of alul's spread, the spread of epithelium, and the increase in macrophages are also seen.
Then, about 20 to 30 percent of patients need careful care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, with the addition of low breaths, including a number of joints, joints, and circuits, the site can usually be affected by the stream, which can be particularly affected by low strength patients.
For the first time, the virus was separated from the biopsy of open mosquitoes by relatives of the Indian disease, who had traveled from the living to Hong Kong.
Since then, great efforts have been made to investigate HCOV.
By the end of 2004, HCov-NL63 had been separated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
Initially, it is found with respiratory disease in young children, the elderly and in patients with reduced strength.
The disease caused by HCOV-BL63 is common in the swelling of the nose, the swelling of the eyes, the swelling of the ears, the swelling of the throat and the swelling of the kidneys
Another free study showed that the same virus was isolated from the case of an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands.
Although it was known in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed on the world level.
It is estimated that in the general respiratory disease, HCV-NL63 is approximately 4.7%, and the symptoms are severe in the early summer, winter and winter.
HCOV-NL63 belongs to the forbidden flesh, which is also known as the cancer.
In the same year, a 71-year-old in Hong Kong was removed from the hospital by HCOV-HKU1, who was admitted to the hospital because of his case and his money.
HCOV-HKU1 was reported with severe pain in the flow of gold and silver from the community.
Likewise, HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, which has a slight respiratory disease, were found worldwide.
It's a very good way to get rid of the people from the four communities of HCOVs, and in general it's very unlikely to change the pathogens, although the incidents are due to unknown reasons, such as a more severe decrease in the type of HCOV-NL63 that caused severe infections in the lower respiratory tract, recently reported in China.
Usually, when they get the ability to move HCOV and stay within humans, they become vulnerable to low-strength or low-strength genes.
MERS-COV was first removed in 2012 from the outbreaks of a 60-year-old in Saudi Arabia who suffered severe excruciating injury and injury.
Where the library is more confirmed in the eastern middle of the case, and sometimes in close contact with the latter is found in the European countries and Tunisia.
A second plague occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases in 2015.
MRS's medical examinations of SARS, which contain the characteristics of advanced models, come together.
Unlike SARS, there is a severe failure in a number of MRS patients, which is very different from MRS due to HCV.
Over 30 percent of patients have signs of paralysis, such as asthma and ALT.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 deaths were confirmed by the library, making Mers-COV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
By the end of December 2019, a large number of patients with SARS-COV-2-related outbreaks had been reported in the history of the Chinese subjugation.
Because of SARS-COV-2, the World Health Organization has made it a critical condition for public health, and has named it COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases worldwide have been confirmed, of which 3.4% have died.
In particular, Hobby, in China, deaths in these cases are 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection and is presented as a self-inflicted, eating, and troublesome
Some patients have also seen asthma.
One of the most severe symptoms is an example and it can increase the risk of severe breath loss syndrome.
Although 82% of the high-level nuclei are combined with SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 because of the constant representation of the high-level nuclei, it is a flag of various branches of the pathological tree.
Apparently SARS-COV-2 virus is less pathogen than SARS-COV and MERS-COV but will move more
In SARS-COV-2, signs of non-signalling topics affected have been reported that can be involved in the rapid spread of them around the world.
There are many interesting illustrations and differences in comparison with six other HCVs in SARS-COV-2.
First of all, HCOVs are very typical of the time and duration of disease progression.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general outline of six other HCVs
The other four symptoms of COVID-19 are between SARS-COV and the other four from the community (HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, it is generally seen that during the invasion of HCVs by the SARS-COV-2 community, including non-specific, minor or no signs, shows the characteristics of its infection.
On the other hand, a small bottom set of COVID-19 cases can also be seen as SARS-COV infection, although this is slightly less
Third, SARS-COV-2's transfer community shows interesting features like HCVs and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, less SARS-COV-2 transfer is as much as the community received from HCOVs.
On the other hand, it remains to confirm that, like what SARS-COV and MERS-COV are like, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is reduced after entering human beings.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-COV-2 can be found in charitable examples.
Although there are at least a few circumstances in which future studies will explain whether SARS-COV cases play an important role in the translation of the SARS-COV-2 language.
This will also be of particular interest to see whether SARS-COV-2 from the community will be shown on time as well as on time.
After entering humans, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including migration, pathogenicity and resistance, will affect the end of the plague of COVID-19.
The fact that the human brain is at the mercy of the human being is the result of the light symbols of the four HCOVs obtained from the community.
From the other point of view, it may also be true that humans have been well adjusted to these four HCVs.
In other words, both types of ancient HCVs can be safe from global illness.
HCVs, which cause severe human diseases and humans who suffer from severe HCV diseases, have been eliminated
To do so, the HCOVs who collect the change will have to be copied into human beings to combat the ban on the host animal and the HCOVs who collect the change.
In this respect, the longer SARS-COV-2 plague will last and the more people will be affected, the more likely people will take it completely.
If it's taken in a good way, then it'll be difficult to prevent it from being transferred to humans through other measures that control the heart or infection.
For several years, four COVs from the community have been operating in the population of CoVs, which has caused the anti-insurgents to get cold in general.
These viruses don't need animal stocks.
On the other hand, the extreme pituitary from the SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not been properly adjusted and their transfer to humans cannot be maintained.
They need to grow in and grow in their animal stocks, and perhaps one or more mediums and abundance of host animals need to find an opportunity to spread their senses into human destiny.
In SARS-COV-2, both SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four characteristics such as HCVs from the community are:
At least then, it's more capable of moving like HCVs from the community.
However, this is more pathogenic than HCVs from the community and less than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
Is there any hope that man will be able to take it by himself, and that he will not be able to move about between humans, without having any resources or hosts?
Before talking about the source of HCOVs, the evolution, nature, resources, medium and extent of HCOVs' host animals will need to be made more specific and to talk about their characteristics.
An animal, if it belongs to a closely related ethnic association, acts as a living host to HCOVs by emphasizing a high-quality image on the surface of the nucleus.
The virus is usually well intertwined in this host animal and is non-pathetic.
Similarly, the host provides constant and long-term shelter for HCOVs
In both cases, the host animals are naturally affected and the HCOV or its fatherly virus is natural.
On the other hand, if HCOV differs from humans at the time of the difference or before the intermediate host from the animal, it does not make better fit for the new host, and most of the breast is gin.
This intermediate guest can act as a source of animal human infection and then the human infection in humans plays the role of a rapidly increasing host.
If the transfer cannot be maintained within the host animal between HCVs, it will be carried out in a closed way.
On the other hand, HCOVs can adapt to animals in the middle of the animal and even establish long-term food.
In such a case, the middle host becomes the host of the animal natural resources.
The number of underlying diseases has revealed with despair that the SARS index case is the date of contact with game animals.
The investigation of subsequent non-proliferation reported that SARS-COV lgG is higher in animal trades than in the general population.
In the market of live animals, the first known species of viruses, such as SARS-COV, are like SARS-COV.
It explicitly supports the fact that no SARS has been reported after all the hits on the markets.
However, it has been reported that the market of the Moscow Pom Shot Balls from forests or crops was largely negative for SARS-COV, which suggests that the Moscow Pom Shot Balls are only operating as a medium-sized animal, but they are not the natural storage of SARS-COV.
In particular, since 80% of all animals have ante-bodies of SARS-COV in the organs of the jungle, the number of small dairy animals cannot be excluded from the scope of SARS-COV to act as a mid-hospital animal.
They all look like the guests of SARS.
As a result of the attack by the natural host of SARS-COV, the coV of the nearby lamp, which is called the RAINOLOF CHAMGADER COV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse's navel lamp, has been removed.
These luminaires are the genetic support of SARS-COV anti-body and SARS-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other bits of COV SARS-COV are 92-88% of the nuclear-tids are part of the satellite culture.
These studies have laid the basis for the new idea that light bulbs are the host of human pathogens.
The number of SARS-types (SL-CoVs) has also been identified with lighters, but no one can be separated as a live virus except for a sealed HIV1.
Human Ink Tenson Changer Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called SARS-COV conjugator
The WIV1 obtained by example of the benefits of light bulbs was shown to be used as a proponent for the entry of light bulbs, light bulbs, and human ACE2.
What's interesting is, the health of the trip was supposed to de-infect SARS patients with HIV1.
Up to now, the closest representation of SARS-COV related to the WIV1 light bulbs is 95 percent of the nucleotide's total image.
Of course, despite the extreme picture between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the fatherly virus of direct SARS-COV and the host of the immediate sources of SARS-COV is not living.
The group's MERS-COV regiment was evaluated as bit CoV-HKU4 and bit CoV-HKU5, Philo's genetics.
Bit CoV-HKU4 and MERC-COV, use the same forward receiver for virus entry, DPP 4 (DPP4)
Based on the RNA of the MERS identified by Europe and Africa, the RNA polymers are essentially closer to our targets in Bett Ta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-COV can be found in the wild lighthouses
MERS-COV and its related beta CoV-HKU25 are only 87 percent of the exhalation of nucleotide.
Thus, the host of MERS-COV's immediate stores cannot live.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East found that, like East Central camels in a number of African countries, MERS-COV has a cobian camel travel for an unaffected entity.
MERS-COV is separated from the virus found in humans by pressing the nose of a cowed camel, and it further indicates that MERS-COV is the real host of animals.
It's worth mentioning that, experimentally, there were minor signs in camels affected by MERS-COV, but large-scale virus outbreaks.
Especially from affected camels, not only the path of breath, but also the graceful language path, which is also the main route of the virus’s bubble.
However, there are still questions because before the symptoms begin, there is no date for the conversion of a number of MERS cases from the camel, which includes the types of animals that protect MERS-COV from humans or unknown animals.
SARS-COV-2 Ranulofis bit with CoV RaT13 bit with 96.2 percent of the nucleotide model
Like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are best placed to establish parental relationships
I mean, bit SARS-COV-2 can't live directly from the real estate until it's about to find a virtual bit of COV in the future.
Likely, the Honnan marine food sink, which contains many original cases of COVID-19, and which may indicate the transfer to human beings from animals to animals, I will sell and destroy species of wild life between SARS-COV-2.
A number of recent studies based on meta genetics suggest that a group of endangered minors known as penguins (mans javinica) may also be sheltered by relatives of SARS-COV-2.
These neo-Pangolan CoV genes, along with SARS-CoV-2, excavated %85-92 nuclear tyz as a proponent.
However, these are so close to RaTG13, with around %90 identification on the level of the nuclear TED console.
These files are subgenital strains such as SARS-COV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which, with the constant identification of %97.4 of the amino acid, is also extracted by the receiver of SARS-COV-2 by the RBD.
On the contrary, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of continuous experimental genes, are more pronounced.
In previous studies of pathogens, there was information about the encounter of viral behind the examples of bats, which are similar to SARS-COV-2.
This study has provided separate genetic comfort, which is about 86.3% of fully-length viral genes, with various assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot eliminate the possibility that the penguin is one of the host animals between SARS-COV-2.
However, the differences between SARS-COV-2 and Pangolan SARS-COV-2 are currently the result of no evidence of the direct support of the right source of the Pangolan SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is smaller than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and Penglon SARS-COV-2 relative to BTA CoVs
The development of SARS-COV-2 is still ongoing in lighthouses, penguins and other dairy animals.
While, among the best image images of SARS-CoV-2 and Pango, the SARA-COV-2 is located in the recipient binding domain, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 exacerbate the most extensive genetic imagery.
This is a very important assumption that SARS-COV-2 and Piguln SARS-COV-2 are a model of high-level surveillance in the reception of BTA CoVs.
According to third wild animals, an answer has been proposed between BTA CoVs and RaTG13 on the subject of the SARA-COV-2.
In the middle of the BT CoVs, the re-distribute of turbi, there is a dynamic force in the building.
SARS-COV-2 still has to decide on the right animal source.
In addition to extreme pathogens, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied as an animal source.
Fileu Genitarian Witness states that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can be the source of the original beta CoVs, when the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in the parentheses.
It has been reported that a bit of coV in the North American bet has revealed a close relationship with HCOV-NL63 (ARCoV.2).
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically separated by another bit of CoV, which was originally part of the hipposidday/Hahnachnom/19/2008, whose address went to Ghana, is also suspected of being a guest among the camels.
For an explanation, the summary of the current knowledge on the source of the known HCVs is presented in the form1 and gidul2.
The File Genetic Analysis has provided evidence of events involving the transfer of HCOVs in history.
Around 1890, when the Home Leo Stock HCOV-OC43 passed the species to affect humans, the global plague of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCOV-229E's combined transfer is less clear
Bit Alpha-CoVs has been closely linked to the HCV-229E
Among them is an Alpha Alpha CoV.
A number of demonstrable viruses directly support the movement of human beings from the right light bulbs.
First, people can be contacted by light bulbs, not by alpines, in the share of the environment.
Rather, it is closer to the human race than to the human race.
Second, HCOV-229E-related beta alpha CoVs-bit is a native and non-Pethogenian beta, while alpaca alpha coV-affected animals are caused by the spread of respiratory disease.
In the end, Alpha Alpha CoV was not found in plant animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the Alpha CoV is part of HCoV-229E-related alpha coV.
In fact, human pathogeny viruses, including shhamol virus, Ebola virus, Napa virus, and Hendra virus are the direct means of direct light.
So it's not too surprising that the lightning can move HCOV-229E directly to the right man.
As an alternative, where Beth Alpha CoVs acts as an HCV-229E genetic valve, there are alpaca and camels just like the MERS-CoV cases, which move viruses into humans, can act as an intermediate agent.
Mers-COV lamps serve as a good example of the movement of camels and camels mixed with humans.
In the lighthouses, the developmental source of MERS-COV is known as its initial identification and is strengthened by its subsequent results.
It is clear that genetics provide a full range of viruses for the transfer of particles and ben alxam and for the exchange of ben alxam.
Long-term, Ninja-populated colonists, close social networking and flying skills, are a good way to become an exemplary 'virus spreader' for light bulbs.
On the other hand, for decades Mers-CoV has been known to a mountain camels
It has been well adapted to those camels that directly have been transformed from the animal to the host of solid and natural resources.
MERS-COV has a very slight disease in these animals and a relatively low rate of change.
Sometimes there is an accident among his people, and humans are the most vulnerable hosts of MERS-COV because they can't keep him moving.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-COV, in the transfer of SARS-COV-2, the role of penguin, if anyone else, is different.
In particular, Penguin B Ta-CoVs has the most Pythogenicity in Penguin B.
Maybe they're a closed host animal for SARS-COV-2 B-Ta-COV, which is connected to satellite policies in the SARS-COV case.
Animal studies in the future include or reject the number of possibilities of combined SARS-COV-2 in humans.
First of all, the SARS-CoV-2 lighthouse which can be a host to an animal like the nearly simulated virus SARS-COV-2.
Human beings exploit the environment with flashlights by listening to violence or coal.
Second, the fast-paced penguin may be one of the host animals, where the SARS-COV-2 virus has been introduced.
Human beings approach the virus through greed and hunting.
It's possible that many dairy animals, including domestic animals, are hunted by SARS-COV-2.
Home and wild animals are guaranteed ante-body
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-COV-2 can be re-produced in a third type of communication with both a turbo- and accommodating lamp and a pengolon.
The search for sources of SARS-COV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to different types of host animals, CoVs are important to provide three majors from the wireless to cross several types of obstacles
First of all, they have relatively different conditions in the RNA.
In comparison with the second single RNA virus, the ratio of the change of the COVs is defined as "intermediately preferred" while the average rate of exchange on each site 2 per year, depending on the degree of conformity of the COV of the host animals, is 10-4.
In CoVs, professional redundancies occur, which can be better modified as a result of removal, even the demand for an impossible hit.
Interestingly, the New Cleo Tide Analogue Remediesvier is going to stop RNA polymers from blocking the copy of the CoVs by means of the arrest of this external binocular and RNA-based RNA.
Remedies are the most intelligent agent that has been tested as SARA-COV-2 in medical practice.
Of course, the rate of change of CoVs is one million times more than its host animals
Besides, often when the COVs host cannot fit properly in the animal, there is a higher rate of change in it.
Compare the highest rate of change in SARS-COV, so apparently there is little change in the SARA-COV-2 that perfectly adapts to humans.
Probably, it's already settled in another host animal for humans.
Besides SARS-COV-2, MERCS-COV, which is well adapted to a cow-backed camel, is logged on.
Visually, it is not possible that the increased genes against SARS-COV-2 would immediately render the vaccine and anti-virals unaffected.
Second, the genes present in COVs change into large RNAs and show the use of increased genetic diversity for resurgence for resurgence, thus increasing the development of mixed currents, which is useful for the development of the COVs when appropriate.
Its support for the 3rd end of the generations is supported by the coding of various individual reading frames and Lahamia's actions.
Third, most COVs accidentally switch to RNA containers through a separate "copy selection" destination.
During the simulation of the COV RNA, the host animal that works as an organization, there's a lot of change in Dor
To prepare new CoVs, the full length of the homelogs and the low genetic RNAs can be restored to the turbulence.
Evidence of the natural derivation of phylogenies is found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs such as beta SL-COV and beta CoV-HKU9.
Hosts of the virus have been tempted to move.
In addition to the above-mentioned three rules of Wire, Wire is an important element in the transfer of Wire with the host animal receiver and mixed-to-air.
With it, SARS-COV is taken back to Turkey as a common example, which witnessed positive election during the mixed-to-maturity move.
In addition to the overriding assessment of the isolation of human SARS-CoVs and satellites, the various host animals of SARS-COV, especially with changes in the Slimia Receptor Binding Domain, are expected to move quickly.
In general, in CoV's Slahamia, the receptor binding domain interacts with the Chilean receptor, and the host's ante-body is strongly chosen by reaction.
In SARS-COV, the S1 fragment is the 510th security evacuatorium from the 318th to the 318th domain, which is held for human ACE2 and viral entry.
SARS-COV receivers are capable of identifying ACE2 receivers for the domain that allow various animals, including light bulbs, satellites, quays and sharks, which allow the combined virus to move.
In fact, the remains of only 6 amino acids in the receiver binding domain were found to be different in the single virill of humans and satellites, 4 of which are found in the form of the receiver binding to interact with the ACE2 receiver.
There are K479N and S487T changes in the socket SARS-COV's receiver binding domain, which can increase the number of people with human ACE2 receivers.
In other words, these two amino acid humans can be an important underlying replacement for the alignment of the viral.
It's worth mentioning, with SARS-COV, the SARS-COV-2 exhales the same Chilean receiver.
The difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit of Slahmia indicates that human ACE2's Slahmia may change the vital nature of its Slahmia.
Indeed, a mysterious study of Burkina Faso's diet suggests that the relationship between human ACE 2 and SARS-COV is increasing from -10 to -20 times.
It would also be interesting to determine whether another lower receiver is needed to transfer SARS-COV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but it is linked to different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receivers, such as HCOV-229E for amino peptide N, and HCOV-OC43 for 9-O-sited silica acid.
They can account for the successful alignment of these coVs after being mixed with humans from their pets.
In addition to the Khaliti Receptors, HCOV is monitored for the results of the move, depending on another host animal and detained.
The spread of the host animals of human nature and the natural resources of HCOVs, such as lighthouses, mountain camels, and dogs, can be a barrier to the movement of these host animals.
A successful combination of HCOVs is the host's anger for the move and the host's arrests of the animal's habitual dependence and interference.
In this regard, the host of the virus has to identify this important part of the operation and identify the characteristics of the virus.
Depending on the host animal and the extensive genetic testing of the non-participating regime for SARS-COV-2, the use of the latest CRISPR technology can be useful
Output from New HCVs: Go back to Zero Ground
Bit CoV's inflow provides a lot of opportunities for HCoVs to spend.
In this regard, Beth CoVs acts as a breeding ground for HCVs.
In addition, the rapid change and genetic shift in Turkey also boosts the development of HCOVs and acts as two key steps in this process.
For example, the New Hamster coding gene has the ability to quickly change the fiber type of the wire.
In SARS-COV, ORF8 is considered to be important in human alignment, such as removing beta viruses related to SARS-COV, but it found different codes of ORF8.
There is a description of the end of SARS -COV's 29 nucleotide in the strains that are separated from the beginning of the human plague.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and it's a corresponding change that promotes movement among host animals.
In addition, with the alpha and gamma-coVs of SARS-COV, there is a history of possible retrieval of turbi, where RNA based on large numbers of RNA polymers identified small retrieval sites.
The location of Reterechibe was identified in some parts of nsp9, most nsp10, and some parts of nsp14.
Likewise, it has been observed that the Mers-CoV web, which was in a mountain camels in Saudi Arabia, has had to experience again the events of Turkey among the various things.
With the exception of SARS-COV and MERS-COV, the retaliatory events are also seen in other CoVs, where HCVs are redesigned with their unconstructed genes with other animal coVs.
It should also be noted that the design choice can be associated with unannounced changes in wireless genes, possibly avoiding the choice of pressure, such as the host animal's resistance system, resulting in the survival of virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of full length of ORF4 in the prototype of HCOV-229 E, which eliminates two nucleotides.
Although HCOV-229E can be seen to be maintained in ORF4 viruses and camels, the Alpha Alpha-CoV shows the entry of a single new clavioid, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the creation of NOUL HCOVs is also driven by the choice of pressure in its host animals.
When the beams are affected by the CoVs, the direction of one without signs or light symbols is indicated, which indicates the alignment between the coVs and the beam.
It turns out that light bulbs have a good fit for the immune and the body of the CoVs.
For example, the effects of coVs on triggering the protective reaction of sush in the lighthouses greatly reduce the pathology
In addition, the NKG2/CD94 and the large historical complexity complex class I have to be suppressed because of the low level of expression of the year-olds of the natural killers in the lighthouses.
In addition, reactivation of the high level of oxygen produced by the high meta-bulk of light bulbs (ROS) by pressing the copy of both CoVs, and by influencing professional reding through the Excise Binoculars to create the very pituitary gene virus strains, when a new host is introduced, provides the choice of pressure.
More pathogens can be prepared again by using turbi, which can increase the properties of nuclei or lamites for the accommodation of the host.
So, it's not a coincidence that in the past two decades, three new HCoVs have gone on.
CoVs are the source of unscathed genes or slight signs of their host animals, such as light bulbs and camels.
They provide powerful hosts with hard-to-response copies of the animal without an anti-response.
It shows why the disease remains unmarked, and why there are very high causes of human infection, the secrets of which are hidden.
Strong symptoms are mainly due to hyper-responsive activity and the current of the site, where strong-responsive reactions are more likely to damage the immune system.
On the other hand, in the absence of a sign of disease, the anti-cooploid reaction has become decapillated by the copy of the CoV
The same practical benefit of non-response in the treatment of the combined SARA-COV-2 is beneficial to non-response.
Especially in the lighthouses, the return of Pharaoh's entry is particularly powerful.
So, at least in the early stages of the SARS-COV-2 infection in humans, the organization of Type I interferons should benefit.
In addition, there is an activity of NLRP3 in the luminaires.
Therefore, it may be useful to stop NLRP3 from treating COVID-19 with MCC950.
The expenditure of SARS-COV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-COV and MERS-COV
Where %95 new clausted model was found with the SARS-COV of a light bulb with a BT CoV, there is a bit -COV that is excavating %96 nucleo-Tide model with SARS-COV-2.
While viruses such as SARS-COV and other animals in Mindy have been found to be safe, the right-hand midway hosts of SARS-COV-2 have not been identified.
The surprise of the penguin B Ta CoVs is an idea of the homologous nature of SARS-CoV-2, which means that the penguin is acting as one of the middle host animals or that the penguin B Ta CoVs can participate in the final version of SARS-COV-2 through the genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that man has created SARS-COV-2 by knowingly or by accident.
Because of the recent outbreak of SARS-COV-2, CoVs have again come to light.
In lighthouses and other animals, the study of CoVs has changed our minds about animal design and animal resources in human transport.
It is widely known that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are the source of light and it has been transferred to humans through an intermediate host.
Seeing that SARS-COV infection is caused by contact between humans and satellites, close the meat cells and kill the satellites and eliminate the SARS disease in a significant way.
That's why, in the face of an inquiry into the numbers of SARS-COVs closer to the SARS-COV-2, you have to remove the penguin from the meat bins to prevent the movement from animals.
However, in future research, it remains to be explained that SARS-COV-2 is moved to humans by the use of penguins and other lactating animals.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV has been in mountain camels for a long time.
For locals, these camels work with the basics of meat, milk, skin and wool as an important means of transport
They are located in a large area of eastern and eastern Africa.
So like SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 to prevent the spread of what was done in China's engines, it's impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MRS.
In order to prevent the current spread of MRS, with other measures to control the infection, it is necessary to consider a common understanding for the preparation of major vaccines against MRS for camels.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses, so they can lead to new genetic types.
The coVs of different species of animals are circling in the forest
In particular, the COVs are very well-designed with the sterilization of animals.
New CoVs, which are more mobile and/ or mined among humans in the future, are many opportunities to prepare and restore animal CoVs.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, there is a need to leave the culture of wildlife in some parts of China.
With the tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be in place.
In fact, for a long time, all viruses have been on the planet.
They live in their natural treasures until they get the chance to grow.
Although there are many features in the lighthouses that cause the spread of viruses, if people are taught, contact with human lighthouses and other types of forest life can be reduced.
For a better understanding of COV and its natural hostess, constant monitoring of milking animals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the movement of animals from humans to humans and in preventing its future spread.
As a result, by staying away from the environmental impact of the viruses that have been transferred from human animals to humans, the virus virus that has been transferred from humans can be prevented in a more powerful way.
The number of primary parts of SARS-COV-2 are still hidden.
First of all, if a SARS-COV-2 virus is transferred to a generation of penguins, it would be interesting to see that the frogs and penguins can absorb the same environmental power in the same situation.
Second, if lightbulbs play a more direct role in human migration, then we need to determine how people come into contact with lightbulbs.
Third, if the third breast-feeding animal acts as a real middle representative, it will explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and penguins.
Finally, because many other dairy animals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-COV-2, so both surveillance and experience should be maintained for infection.
If light bulbs, penguins, or any other dairy animal, it is expected that in the future SARS-COV-2 and its fatherly virus will be identified in its natural representatives.
Continuing research in this field will explain the evolution of SARS-Cov-2, with a significant impact on stopping and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update COVID-19's "confirmed case" and "confirmed case" diagnostic standards
On 6 February 2020, our team published a high-speed guidance book for the identification and treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronairs (2019-nCOV) infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference to the global fight against global disease.
However, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, which is gradually increasing based on the results of further research in our intelligence and knowledge and on the experience of medical practice; therefore, medical and medical wisdom is constantly being updated.
In this letter, we have our guide names, which the National Health Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of China has issued, but in response to a comment, we say that the COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) is the most recent reference standard for the definition and final treatment of the "student case" and "confirmed case".
In December 2019, Noul Coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which is now officially named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was spread and the virus has been called severe respiratory distress Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a global scourge.
To fight against SARS-COV-2 infection, our team has prepared a quick advice letter and it has been published online in the military medical research on February 06, 2020.
He's got more attention after the release.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, with the results of further research in our intelligence and knowledge and the experience of medical practice increasing gradually; therefore, the work of science and medicine is being constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of China has issued a guide for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). Its total seven issues were launched from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some major changes in the area.
Now our guide has received a review from Ziva et al., who has proposed to easily score on the basis of their medical experience.
Their work added a new witness to our guidebook, and it is a valuable reference to this worldwide plague.
We acknowledge their deeds and give thanks to Him.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to COVID-19 (Seventy Trials) and the latest study guide for the most recent diagnosis and treatment.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive review of the history of the disease must be combined with two medical examinations to confirm the case, or three medical examinations must be combined without a clear history of the disease:
The history of underlying diseases: (1) the location of the city and the surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the date of contact with SARS-COV-2; (3) the date of contact with the emergency cassettes (with the confirmation of the nuclear acid test); (3) the city and surrounding areas or other relatives where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days prior to the start of the symptoms; (4) the date of contact with the confirmed cassette patients; (4) the date of contact with the confirmed casssskets (a small house, office school class and 2 weeks prior to the start of symptoms); and/or with symptoms.
Medical examinations: (1) the symptoms of fever and /or breath; (2) the visual characteristics of the infection of COVID-19; (3) the number of white blood cells in the first stage shows the number of lymphocyte sites in the first stage.
PathoJink or virological evidence should identify the case confirmed with any of the following: (1) the actual time PCR test for SARS-COV-2; (2) the total viral genes showing the highest level of novel coronairs; (3) the specific LgM anti-body and LgG anti-body test for SARS-COV-2; or the specific LgG anti-body negative for SARS-COV-2 or increased by ≥4 times in the fast-acting phase of the tire.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nuclear acid was included in the samples of breath or blood in two (18 January 2020) and three (22 January 2020).
Examples of blood transfusions included the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020) numbers; and the travel witnesses were included in the seventh.
Research-based modification is ongoing, which is needed to quickly identify with the confirmed standard, with the need to obtain samples of the breath called blood, which increase the availability of various samples, and help to produce positive results from the particular ante-body.
In addition, there are many other witnesses who remind us of patients with no symptoms and traditional signs.
So, the Green et al chart should be updated, because they've locked the person in "low risk" without any medical signs.
The score system also needs to be confirmed in more medical practice and studies.
As a result, we demand more immediate expectations of the coming of the true witness and of the kareans to present their influences
For the purposes of identifying "student case" and "confirmed case", we advise them to identify and implement the latest names of the most modern guidelines in their country of origin.
To provide help, our team immediately updates our guide name.
Five new deaths have been reported due to COVID-19 in the south of Bangladesh, which is the most frequent daily
Last day, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the most devastating virus in the day.
Up until tomorrow, Bangladesh’s NGO, disease control and research (IEDCR) reported that 114 active cases and 33 health cases are still at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Explaining details on an online news, IEDCR Director Dr. Mergedi Sobrina Flora said that four men in the destruction include one woman.
According to Dr. Meer Gjidi, two cases were older than 60 years, between 51 and 60 years, and one was 41 and 50 years old.
They said, “Two of those who were killed were from the Cave.”
On March 11th, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a global scourge.
A hospital worker told Naadlo Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was a glorious Sep Al-Rahman, who was the director of the Bengali Insidad Bad Name, whose custody was held at Kuwaiti Metro Hospital.
On a weekly basis, an online video release, Bangladesh Deshi Road Transport and Burg's Minister Abed Alkader said that public transportation and transport will be suspended for a long time from next week under the initial plan.
Initially, the closure of the public transport media began on 26 March and was planned to end on 4 April on a weekly basis.
Necessary agents -- medical equipment, fuel and food -- were still allowed to transport.
On March 8th, the first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were two people who returned from Italy and were recorded in one of them's wives.
By 19 March, they had already been cured three times.

In Australia’s stores, the tsho papyri of Bethhla was reduced in every line of religion
On Sundays and Sundays, Wall Warth and Coles of the Australian Stock Exchanges placed the bans on each line of religion and reduced to one pack of bills on all the national stores.
ALDI also introduced a package on the day of Pierre.
These limits were posted on the Facebook pages of the check auts, and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Because of the fear of COVID-19, the need for self-contained loneliness has been reported by buyers.
On the other hand, Wall Warth also limited the purchase of the tsho-paper by the house to one package on each order.
These changes were announced on 4 and 5 March in the past by Wal Warth and Coles, following the bans of four packs on each line religion.
Coles, on March 8, in media releases, said that with four packets on the same spot, "many stores are still selling within an hour's notice," and this month was called "no example", while ALDI called Mangul on a Facebook post, called it "extra expected".
According to Wall Warth's translator, last week's sale was "Zeberman's increase".
The Costa Rican stock market also limited the number of last week's permission to two packs.
In order to reduce the fall, Coles ordered large packages from the supporters and added to the ban, Vol Worth ordered an additional warehouse, while ADLI made the plan for special initial availability on Sunday.
The Executive Director of the Australian Sales Agency, Russell Zimmermin, said that they are trying to increase the sales of food, but banning it at the time of the local council's emergency truck has made it difficult.
They've been trying to meet the rising production demands, because the suppliers are trying to meet the moon and do something special.
On Monday, ALDI announced that after the stock was small, some stores could not run a particular mess.
Coinland University of Technology, expert Dr. Gary Martyr of Food, said in a News.com.au report that Stores are stockpiling daily nights
He said, "There's a big thing about Beth-hore's tash paper, which makes it very low, and when it's sold, it leaves the shell's wide space empty, which makes it feel like it's hard.
Russell Zimmermin said in ABC news that Coles and Wal Warth [that] if there are a lot of things on the Shelf, if there are a lot of things that can be bought as a housekeeper and as a sentinel, and if they're available, maybe you can reduce the fear.
A cypress-scattered wheeled housewives engineer said to the past, "They're going to be gone."
According to News.com.au's report, Cameron Clarke, who builds a touch of the Clins House, and Solares, who build a superbent, insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
A sales website for Jaiddad, Domain.com, said that some people who sell Jaiddad in Melbourne offer the first speaker to a free handbill, when the buyers had time for a long weekend at the time of the workers' day.
The journal Daron included eight pages of inscriptions in NT News, which meant that they would be cut off and used as a toilet paper.
On 3 March, according to a report by ABC Australia, Stor actually avoided granting these prohibitions, which he said was not intended to impose a ban on their purchases.
Russell Zimmermin also said that there is a greater demand for other designs, including masks, sinteres, dry ash, hand washers, and eggs.
Similarly, the purchase of the British Supermarket outside Australia on Sunday evening was observed to limit the purchase of two to 12 Rolls Packs.
The World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 is a global scourge.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHH) announced that COVID-19 continued to spread — the disease caused by Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 — is a global scourge.
Although the wave of "disease" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to the fact that girls are particularly dangerous, the World Health Organization stressed the need for action by governments."
All countries can change the face of this global scourge
If countries are to identify, test, treat, separate, target, and move their people in response.
We're very worried about both vessels of this disease because of its nature and severity and the vicious nature of its activity.
According to Dr. Tom Fredin, the world's web site "extraordinary" is an old director of the control and prevention of diseases of the United States.
In his observations published in February in C.N., he said, "In addition to influenza, no such concern has been found from the beginning of any other respiratory virus to the global epidemic."
Heybriss put it this way, "We didn't get the world's plague that's spread out of Coronnaires."
He kept saying, "And we haven't been able to control the world before."
The World Health Organization's new status as a World Health Organization in January was announced after the decision to establish the health status of the World Health Organization.
Dr. Anthony Fossy, director of National Allergy and Insty Tut, U.S.A., said about this Pila Ou, "It's a fact that it's growing towards further destruction."
The esoteric acid press reported that the number of patients with COVID-19 worldwide has increased to 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
COVID-19 is a type of current global plague of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is a severe respiratory disease of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
In December 2019, this plague was identified in the city of China, Wahan, and on January 30, 2020, it was declared to be an international threat to public health, and on March 11, 2020 it was identified as a global plague.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were reported in 210 countries and letters, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have died.
The rate of death in China is 4%, while it reaches up to %08 in New Zealand at global level from 13.04 in Algeria.
Its general symptoms include fever, human suffering, and breathing.
Symptoms in complications may include symptoms of severe difficulty in breathing and breathing
From the onset of this disease to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes about five days, but it can be between two and four days.
There is no known vaccine or particular antiviral treatment.
The first treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment: to take precautions, to keep your face down, to avoid distance from others, and to keep people under control and to keep separate who are suspected of being affected.
The world's authorities have been protecting travel bans, quarantine, Karfuca's reputation, job risk control, and the closure of facilities.
The worldwide plague has called for riots, riots, riots, religious, political and social events, and the widespread use of equipment because of the lack of modesty.
Schools and universities in 193 countries either closed on the national level or on the local level, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's population.
Wrong understanding of the virus spread online, and other people from China, East and South-East Asia and other peoples from different backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds, where virus events are more prominent.
Low incomes and the closure of large factories have reduced the emissions of coal and coal.
Health authorities in Wawhan, China, announced on 31 December 2019 an unknown sample of cases, and a survey was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these events are related to Honan from the marine food tank of the cell market and are believed to be from the offspring of animal diseases.
The virus from which this plague is known as SARS-COV-2, which is a newly discovered virus that linked the outbreak of coronaviruses, penguin coronaviruses and SARS-COV to a close relationship. The first person to experience septic symptoms of the disease was on 1 December 2019, and the person mentioned did not have a direct contact with the market segment.
Two-thirds of the initial events reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the Southern China Maring Post advised in an unintended report that a 55-year-old in the Hobi province could be the first event on November 17, 2019. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although there are fewer events in China, because of the sudden increase in events in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of events outside China increased for the first time in China.
It may be that the number of events is reduced, especially among people with common symptoms.
On 26 February, 19 years of age and younger, relatively few events have been reported, leaving 2.4% worldwide. British chief scientist Patrick Wellens estimated that 60% of Britain's population would be affected by the increase before it became a major factor.
According to the official protocol, the number of people affected by the events has been tested for COVID-19 and the results have been confirmed.
By March 23rd, no country tested 3% of its population, and this government policy of several countries said that only individuals with simple symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, should not be tested.
On 16 March, a study published in China revealed that 86% of patients with COVID-19 by January 23 failed to find out and that it caused an infection in non-registred patients with registred patients.
A census published on March 30th estimated that the number of seizures affected in Italy was far more than what was reported.
For COVID-19, the original parent crop number (R0) is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Department of Disease Control and Prevention of Tatum concluded that this could be 5.7.
Most people in COVID-19 get better
For those who don't know it, the duration of death is 6 to 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5th, approximately 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% of those with pre-existing diseases, including heart disease and diabetes-COVID-19 worldwide, usually consist of deaths that have been confirmed by their COVID test according to the government protocol.
The right number of deaths from COVID-19 could be a lot higher than that, because these deaths do not include those who are killed without testing -- for example at home, in nursing home, etc.
From Italy it was found in a separate data that the number of deaths increased during this global plague is more than the official number of deaths from COVID over the number of deaths of x4-5.
One translator of the United States Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths reported] has been reduced," which confirms reports on the number of deaths reported in the United States. Such minor reports are often found during World War I, as was reported during 2009 by H.H. 1 and S.I.F.F.W.A. The first event of the confirmed destruction occurred on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of China was 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was 14 February in France.
By February 28, more than one grade of deaths, Iran, South Korea and Italy had occurred outside Central China.
By March 13, more than forty countries and letters, except for the southern Mediterranean, have reported deaths. Several other measures are being used to determine deaths.
With the passing of letters and time, this number varies, and the standards of testing, treatment systems, treatment powers, after the initial breakdown of the plague, and the characteristics of the population are affected by age, gender, and overall health. The proportion of deaths and deaths is divided into the number of deaths identified events during a particular period.
On the basis of the data provided by Jung Hopkin University, April 10, 2020 is 6.0% of world deaths and events (97,039/1,617,204).
The number is different from the letter.
In China, the rate of death (CFR) is below 17.3% from the onset of disease symptoms by January 1-10, 2020, and is below 17.3% from the beginning of the disease by February 1st, 2020, and 0.7% from the beginning of the disease. Other measures include the rate of death (CFR) which shows the percentage of people who die from the disease, and the rate of deaths from the infection (IFR) which shows the percentage of people affected (exclusive and unspecified) who die from a disease.
These numbers are not for a particular time, and from the infection to the final solution, they are for a particular population.
A number of experts have tried to count this number for a particular population.
As evidenced by Oxford University's medical center, it is estimated that between 0.1% and 0.39% of the world's infection rates are between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this strain in Germany is consistent with a numerical study that examined the effects of COVID-19 on CFR strains.
WHO claims that this global plague can be controlled
The outbreak of this disease and the end of the period are different and uncertain from that of the palace.
Macege Bunny, from Pan State University, said, "Don't get stuck, so spread a lot of levels generally increase as high and then start coming down when you don't get any more patients.
But it's impossible when it's going to happen, so now there's a reasonable plan."
High Health Counsel Zong Panshan of the Chinese Government said, "This can end until June," if all countries are urged to follow his advice on the measures to prevent the spread of the disease virus."
On March 17th, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Adm told Karski that SARS-COV-2 "will be around for one or two years"
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Fargoson, separation and other measures will require "until no vaccine is available (actually 18 months or more)."
William Schiffner of the University of Wenderbolt said, "I don't think it's possible that this coronary will be completely exhausted -- because it's easily transmigrated," and it's going to be "a weather disease, and it's coming back every year."
The destruction of the return will depend on the reduction of the Afghan embargo and its modification.
The symptoms of COVID-19 diseases can be relatively inaccessible and the affected may be symptomsless.
Two related symptoms include fever (88%) and dryness (68%)
Less common symptoms include the formation of bilirubin in the throat, the ability to swallow, the retention of breath, the retention of joints and joints, the pain of throat, coldness, coldness, coldness, cough, blood flow in the human body, ash or blue iraqan. The World Health Organization says that almost one person gets seriously ill and suffers from breathing.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention List includes the following symptoms: pain in breathing, increased pain or pressure in the breast, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking up and face or sores; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended -- more ankylosing symptoms, severe respiratory pain, body pain, blood damage, and death.
Some of these affected individuals may have no symptoms, they may be tested without medical symptoms, so researchers have recommended that those who contact confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
Unmarked China is estimated to be up to %44.
Generally, the duration of incubation (between the onset of infection and the onset of symptoms) is 14 days; it is usually five days; as an example of uncertainty, COVID-19+ ended with 30% of the people who were initially affected by the attack, and 15% of the people who later became less and less than 15% of the people.
The extent to which this disease spreads, its daughter is being explained
It is thought that this disease is spread because of initially close relationships and from the tiny bubbles that occur when people, cocksuckers or talk; where the distance is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) in close contact.
Studies show that from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) can be pumped away without a human being.
The girls have advised that the virus can spread from the tiny bubbles that live in the wind for a longer period of time when breathing out of breath can cause the bubbles of breath during conversation, although it is not usually the virus.
These bubbles can penetrate the face or nose of people close to them, or they can enter the linings when they breathe.
Girls' medical practices, such as abrasive and creative ingestion of breath with their mouth, can bring out breathing disorders and thus can spread into the wind.
It can slow down when an impactor bends the surface and then closes its cheeks, nose or face.
While there are concerns that it can get out of the face, its risk is considered to be small.
The Chinese government has refused to transfer SARS-COV-2 through a woman who has left the body. This virus is very expensive until three days before the beginning of the virus symptoms, although its spread is possible before the symptoms and at the end of the disease.
Since a three-day positive test occurs from the onset of symptoms of the disease, it is believed that the transfer of the disease is possible before the presence of significant symptoms.
There have been only a few reports of confirmed events from the library where no signs of disease have been identified in the past, but girls have discovered the transfer of symptoms without investigation into treason in countries.
Europe's Disease Control and Prevention Center (CDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily this disease can spread, one person can usually affect two or three people -- this virus can survive from hours to days on different levels.
In particular, these viruses were identified on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 sten-lis steel for three days, up to one day and up to four hours on tobacco.
However, it's a long-term difference in the temperature and temperature of plants and other animals. The COVID-19 test has been positive in plants and animals.
There is no evidence that this virus can be transmitted to humans by the British authorities after contacting animals, as they do when contacting other areas that have been affected.
The severe paraffin symptoms of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are a new virus, which has been separated from the previous three individuals who are in a pattern that connects them with a group of severe respiratory diseases in the city.
All the characteristics of the NOUL SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the relevant natural coronavirus -- outside the human body, the virus can be removed from the wild soap, which lowers its protective cover, which is related to the actual SARS-COV-2.
It is believed that his offspring are from animal diseases.
The genetic analysis has shown that Coronnaires is related to the family of Coronnaires, the family of the B-to-Coronnaires in the family of Phryra.
On the global GNOME level, this is 96% of the other BatCoV RaTG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that in the human and panglin viruses, there is only one small particle in the genome.
To date, it has been shown from the full GNOME that most of the genetic material is part of the Pangolin Coronnaires and SARS-COV-2, which is sufficient to prove that the average of the Pangolin virus is host
The virus's temporary diagnosis of infection may be based on symptoms of disease, although the impact is confirmed by the pressure media or the ICT Xerra. The resource transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is finally performed.
A study comparing PCR to CT said that CT versus PCR is less specific but is obviously more sensitive, although its underlying characteristics are related to other symptoms and diseases.
By April 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology suggests that CT should not be used for screening or for defining COVID-19 as a test of the first phase.
WHO has published several RAA testing protocols for SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Test uses resource transcription polymers Chinese reaction (rRT-PCR) at the same time
This is done on the sample of the test breath or blood.
Its results usually range from a few hours to days.
Usually, this is done through a test production info channel, although it can be used in the throat by the operation of the tube. Many libraries and companies are using a plastic test device, which identifies the ant's body.
By April 6, 2020, none of them had proved to be correct enough to allow it to be used on a large scale.
In the United States, a serological test has been prepared by Selx, which was only approved for use in refrigeration laboratories.
These people's radiography and computer tomography (CT) feature depiction of the symptoms of the disease, including symmetrical peripheral ground glass opiates and non-presentation.
Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of imagery of events
Because of being overcome by other infections such as Adino Virus, the identification of COVID-19 images without PCR authentication is limited.
In a large study in China, the CT results of sine were compared to PCR stents, which showed that while the anti-infection image has a low profile, but it is faster and more sensitive, the sceptre suggests that it should be viewed as a screening activity in the surrounding areas.
In order to identify both the active properties of the virus, radiography and CT.
In order to prevent the transfer of the disease, the wisdom of this disease is generally maintained in the workers of general health care, the giving of pills, the rubbing of fingers, nose or face, and the ginning of pancreas and pancreas, and the ginning of the pancreas in the pancreas.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures are also proposed to prevent disease from moving away from one another - several countries have limited travel or have avoided unnecessary travel in other countries or to avoid getting into letters that are affected by the disease.
However, the virus has reached the rate of spread in the community in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is growing in society, and the girls in the community don't know how and where they've been affected. Healthcare professionals, who are afraid to get affected by this disease, are advised that they should be advised to provide standard warnings about communication and their safety -- an important way to contact health authorities to find the source of the infection and prevent further transfer.
For this purpose, the secret fears have been raised through the use of mobile phone data from governments, the Amnesty International and 100 other organizations, which have issued a statement to restrict this kind of surveillance.
By April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have logged it in or advised for voluntary use, one of the more groups is working on a secret friendship solution, such as using Bolotai and getting the opportunity to use the palace from other mobiles.
After that, the user receives a message if he is close to a person whose outcome has been positive COVID-19, misconception about the date of the infection is running; for example, watering in the nose and watering of the mats is not possible.
There's no vaccine for COVID-19, but several agencies are working on preparing someone.
To prevent the spread of the disease, it is advised to have a fever
The CD often advises people to use soap for 20 seconds, especially after they go to bed or when the hats are clearly dry, before the soap; and when someone cleans, takes people, or sneezes.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the raw soap when its protective cover collapses.
CCD advises the use of an alcohol-based end-sensitizer with at least 60 % of alcohol in terms of size, when soap and water are not available
The World Organization advises healthy people to avoid rubbing their hands, nose, or mouth with no hands.
Levels should be cleaned in a number of ways (to be kept up to one minute in front of a creative steel surface) including %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 asperophenol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen oxide and from 0.2 to %7.5 pvidon iodine.
Other ways, such as benzalkonium chloride and carboxylic glaucoma are less effective
The CD suggests that if there is a dispute or a reasonable COVID case, such as a desk or an office, then all areas, such as the office, Bethhlah, etc., should be cleaned from the body, including some electrical equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, boards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their faces with their back mouth or tash, eating and pulling their faces and killing them immediately.
The suggestion to wear a surgical mask is that those who may be affected may be affected, because wearing a mask restricts both the size and distance of the affected person's limbs, when he speaks, takes care of, and takes care of.
The World Health Organization has continued to offer suggestions on when and how to wear masks.
According to the University of Leeds' expert Virus, Stephen Graffon, "the possibility of wearing a mask can be reduced to touch people's faces, which is a major means of infection if the proper use of hats is not maintained." The use of mask is also recommended for those who are affected by the disease.
The World Health Organization has proposed wearing masks for healthy people only if their health is at serious risk, as if they're treating people with a COVID-19 patient, although they admit that wearing masks prevents people from rubbing their faces.
A number of countries have begun to encourage the public to wear face masks
In the United States, the U.S.-made CD-C recommends wearing a mask of unsanitary face. China has specifically proposed that healthy people from the public use a damaged medical mask, especially when others are about 1 meter (3 ft) or less.
Hong Kong suggests using public access media or wearing sorghum masks in sheep’s folds.
Thai health authorities are urging people to dress in their homes and feed them.
Democratic Czechs and Slovaks have banned people from wearing masks or wearing their nose and face in public without a smile.
On March 16, Vietnam has asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has authorized that everyone should wear masks when entering trade fairs.
Israel has told everyone to wear a mask when they go to the public.
Taiwan, which is preparing ten million masks a day since mid-March, also needs to be wearing a mask on buses and buses between the trains and cities from April 1.
The mask of a face leaving the house in Panama is required to wear, while the houses advised to prepare masks for people who do not have the ability to buy masks.
Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands and the United States use broad-based facial masks.
Social distance (called physical distance) includes disease control activities aimed at limiting close contact between people and reducing the spread of infection.
These include Corinth, travel bans, schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
People are able to log in by staying at home, not going in, not accepting blessed winds, and physically separated from each other.
Many governments in these areas that are affected by the disease are seeking social distance or giving advice
More than 250 people were quickly proposed by US government agencies and health organisations (where there is no known event of the COVID-19 map) and 50 people were subsequently made to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two public meetings: older people and those who are ill, such as diabetes, chronic heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and poor immune systems, and they have been advised to stay at home for more time because of the plague in society. At the end of March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health institutions began to change the term "social distance" to make it clear that its aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social conditions, or by effectively or remotely eliminating it.
In terms of social distance, people insisted that they should remain completely separate from the world, instead of being urged to contact other people's alternative ways. The girls' governments have issued guidelines on sexual health during World War II.
Among them are those who have been asked not to have sex with anyone other than their friends who are not infected with the virus or virus.
Self-made at home is intended for people who have identified COVID-19 and who doubt that they are affected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for self-inflicted loneliness. Many governments have required or proposed that the entire population living in some affected area go to self-inflicted Corinth.
The most severe offerings made by the Cortina itself have been made to those in serious danger groups.
Those who have been in contact with COVID-19 patients and those who have recently travelled to a country or country where large numbers of people have moved have been advised of the 14 days of self-contained quarantine from the final possible exposure.
In the face of a plague, there is a lack of wisdom in those who are able to control it, to control it, or to control it, and to reduce it.
The wisdom of controlling is created in the early stages of the practical cure, and the aim is to find and separate the affected people, inform them of other measures to control the infection and to take vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are made to reduce its spread: measures are being taken to reduce it, and health care is reducing its impact on health care systems and society.
Prevention measures and mitigation measures, both should be suspended at the same time, in part.
To suppress the plague, more severe measures need to be taken to eliminate the disease's main disease ratio from less than 1 percent to 1 percent. One part of the plan for the disease epidemic is to try to reduce the plague's level, which is called the plague's disease epidemic.
It reduces anxiety about the health services, which are being defeated, and provides more time for the preparation and treatment of the vaccine.
Non-adjudicative measures that can administer the treatment of the plague include emergency measures, such as the cleaning of the hat, the wearing of facial masks, and self-made corontine; social measures aimed at physically detachment, such as the closing of schools and the commemoration of collective events; the inclusion of the community to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; and its conservation of environmental measures, such as clear detachment – were more severe measures to prevent the plague in China, once the severity of the plague was revealed, such as providing full cities with severe travel bans.
Other countries have put in place a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has created large screening and local settings, and has continued the movement of affected people.
Padapor provided financial assistance to those affected who made themselves the Kortanites and who did not.
In Taiwan, the supply of facial masks and medical supplies has increased. Britain and the United States show that there is little (but it is not over) and pressure (increasing the world's population) is a major challenge.
Less and less policies can cure the demand level up to 2/3 and reduce the rate of death to half, but as a result, hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems can be defeated.
Pressure can be preferred as a transfer, but it should continue until the virus flows into the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is before) then it returns to the early health center when the measures are softened.
Long-term intervention, social and economic expenditures to suppress the global scourge
There is no special antiviral for COVID-19, but its preparation efforts are ongoing, including experience on current medications.
The use of Indad cold medications, drinking more water, and rest help to eliminate symptoms of disease
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygenation, blood pressure and breathing may need help.
The use of steroids can further damage the results
Many of the treatments previously approved for other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.

The respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-COV-2 virus include a method in the laboratory test that identifies the presence of viruses and their presence that produce antibodies as a result of the infection
As RT-PCR examples, confirm the presence of virus, which reveals the RNA of the coronary artery.
This is a specific test and has only been designed to reveal the RNA of the SARS-COV-2 virus.
It's used to confirm too late or active infection.
Anti-Body can also be used for the purpose of identifying and controlling the population.
Anti-Body Tests show how many people had this disease, including those with so few signs that there were no signs to report.
On the basis of the results of these tests, the correct rate of disease mortality and the level of resistance in any population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, such as Abi Mar 2020, no country has data on the spread of this virus in its population.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than %3 parts of its population, and there is also a lot of difference in how many countries will be tested.
As a result of this change, there is a great deal of difference in the report on the rate of destruction, which is likely to be more than an estimate in some countries.

On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received the FDA for a test that takes 45 minutes to complete.
FDA approved a test using isothermal acid amplification technology instead of PCR
Because it doesn't need an alternate heat cycle, this method results in less than five minutes of positive results and negative results in 13 minutes.
At the time, there are 18,000 machines in the United States, and Ebit is expected to increase the number of machines to increase by 50,000 tests by a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is especially limited to the N-protein, in Taiwan, in order to provide results in 15-20 minutes like an influenza rapid test.
The final words of the review of the text in March 2020 are: "There is no significance to the radiographic analysis of the brain in the original target, but the presence of CT computed tomography is possible before signs appear."
In the general characteristics of the CT, two-sided flat-walled laber-ground glass is a thin layer of unresolved glass, which includes the distribution of the latter and the latter.
It's growing like disease, full government, crazy easy and stable.
Well, where the world's most progenitor was born, a study suggested that CT is more sensitive to PCR, although it is less specific, than many of its features are associated with the pattern of disease and disease.
By April 2020, the U.S. Radiology College advised that "COVID-19 should not be used as the first priority. By March 2020, CDC advised PCR for initial screening.
The anti-infection force, including IgM and IgG, is to generate a secondary reaction to anti-buddies.
They can be used to detect infections in people who have started symptoms of 7 days, to determine the strength of resistance, and to those who are in strict control, central libraries (CLTs) or mental testing centres (PCTs).
In many clinical libraries, the self-testing system will be able to produce high-quality products, but their availability will be suspended at the production level for each system.
The only example of blood used for the CLT is generally used, although many examples can be used to prove resistance.
A blood sample for POT is usually obtained quickly by sneezing.
There is no need to check the cost of the PCR system before it is tested. On March 26, 2020, FDA listed 29 agents who provide feedback to the agency and are now able to distribute their anti-body tests.
By April 7, 2020, only one test was approved under the permission of the FDA for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for tests on IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
Within a few hours, the ability to test hundreds of samples is faster than traditional PCR for RNA virus.
Anti-Body is usually identified 14 days after the outbreak. In early April, Britain found that there was no need to use any of the test pieces purchased for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that allows patients to stay at home, "The emergency department will give the patient an example," he will fail, send it back, and shortly thereafter the British NHS has announced that this scheme is starting to test a scheme on the home on an experimental basis, which will eliminate the risk of transmission of the patient to the other person or if they arrive at the hospital after once using ambulins from those who have escaped from the infection from which they have been rescued from having been treated with infection.
South Korea has tested faster and faster than any country due to the Dreo Thro Centers. In Germany, the National Institute of Health Insurance in Germany said on 2 March that it has the capacity to test 12,000 in a five-day general meeting and will test 10,700 last week.
When a Fiction Test says, spending on health insurance goes on.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has 160,000 tests per week
The tests were conducted in several major cities by April 19th.
By April 26, 2020, Germany did not know the number of tests, because only positive results are reported.
According to the first Leb survey, the calendar was tested for samples from Week 12/2020 to 483.295 and for weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (%6.9) were tested for 2-SARS-COV. In Israel, the Technician and Rambam Hospital conducted a procedure to test samples from 64 patients at Beck time, in which all samples are collected and only further tested in this case when the sample was positive. In that year, "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ., or "Fire Eye") was installed a 2,000-square-square-metre long-term laboratory, which started on 5 February 2020.
{NS}
The operation of the Wayan Library is immediately initiated by the Hoo-yon Librarians in Shinzin, Theanjin, and Shanghai, in 12 cities in all of China.
By March 4, 2020, the capacity of 50,000 tests was up. Origami Assays has conducted an open source of many alanaser designs that can only test COVID-19 1122 patients with 93 attempts, which can be used in small libraries without the use of a robot tool.
Until March, the European Union and Britain and the United States have become a major barrier to large-scale testing and inadequately controlled reagents.
As a result, some authors have set up a protocol for the preparation of the sample, which limits the sample to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes so that the RNA GNOME or Cremosm can be used for further testing. According to the United Arab Emirates, on 31 March, it is now testing more of its population's coronaries than any other country, and it is planned to reach its entire population.
Such a driver had a strong capacity and a group of 42 and BGI (a large-scale library based on "HUO-Yan" based in China) and a large-scale library.
In 14 days, this library ran a thousand HRT-PCR tests and is the first library to operate on such a scale as China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States have made different testing techniques in order to target various parts of the genetic profile of Coronnaires.
The World Health Organization used the German scheme for low-income countries, which do not have the means to cut.
The German plant was published on 17 January 2020, with no protocols to control the disease in the United States until 28 January, thus protecting the standards of test cut in China and the United States during the early days of the outbreak of the virus in the United States, and they were unable to provide recommendations and requests from health experts from countries and Australia.
On the contrary, experts say that the large supply of South Korea's testing has led to a decline in the spread of Novel Coronairs.
In the past few years, the Government of South Korea has developed testing skills in private sector laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Agency urged the strengthening of testing programs to reduce the spread of COVID-19 worldwide disease. The increase in virus spread has increased and thousands of private American laboratories have been tested, and there has been pressure in the support of wound treatment and chemical treatment.
In March 2020, China reported on the correctness of its test pieces.
There were "deficits" in CDC cuts in the United States, the government removed office barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased cuts from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were not correct.
The order explained that the cause of the wrong result is not to use the flaws or cuts correctly in order to collect examples of the wrong results.
Spain's advice said that the wrong crop will be removed and replaced by the Shenzhen Bioeasy's test cut from China purchased by the state check 80% produced the wrong crop. 1.2 million tests purchased by Slovakia did not come out properly.
And why major Matouch suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Turkish health care agency said that Turkey's harvests from China are "too high" and that they "have not been used." Purchased 3.5 million tests from British China, but in early April 2020 declared that they are not usable.
As a result of the test, the positive results of the attempt to identify those who had been corthened and those who were in contact with SARS-COV-2 victims came to light.
In Vo, Italy, where the first death of COVID-19 occurred, researchers from the entire population, with some 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Almost half of those tested had no signs, and all of the cases were corthened.
The case of new infections was completely eliminated due to the restriction of travel to a particular human group.
As a result of the wide range of contacts with affected people, travel restrictions, testing and Coronnaires 2020, the global epidemic has had little impact on the world's developed countries, where there were no strong restrictions, such as forcing leaders and forcing sales.
Many events have been celebrated, and Gada Por began to advise citizens to stay confined to their homes on 28 March, but opened the school on 23 March after the massacres ended.
Many other countries have been able to find out about the worldwide disease, travel bans, testing and quarantine, but have not done more than donate, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a numerical survey, the countries that have tested more, on the basis of the death rate, have fewer deaths rates, perhaps because these countries have been able to reveal people with little or no signs.
WHO has recommended that countries with no national libraries with COVID-19 capability to test, so they send their first five positives and ten negative COVID-19 examples to confirm 16 WHO reference libraries.
7 of these 16 reference libraries are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of Positive Tests" is related to a country's testing policy
The country that only tests people entering the hospital will have more positive tests than the country that tests all its citizens, whether there are signs or not, will take them all the same.
Handwashing (or handwashing) is also known as handwashing; it is intended to clean your hands from dust, clay, germinal or other unnecessary material
On some "thorough occasions" in one day, the soap often prevents many diseases from spreading from the hands of the soap, such as the path of the mucus and the mucus.
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases, such as infection or general tingling, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or face.
In one day, it is necessary to wash your hands with soap: before and after bedtime, after changing the child's lower part of the cleaning or the dipper, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing food and then after or after touching the meat, fish or garlic.
If water and soap are not available, hands can also be cleaned from the rubble. The World Health Organization has suggested the following steps to wash hands:
Before preparing food, during and after.
Before and after the patient's anxiety.
After changing the depth or using the toilet, the child is cleaned.
After the nerves were cleaned, the flesh or the gunshots.
After touching the prey of the animal, the food of the animal or the food of the animal.
Health care must be in line with the principles of health care.
Your hand can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease by washing your hands or taking medical care before taking the medicine.
Medically, the main purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other eating disorders that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or spread disease.
This is especially true for those who are related to food or medicine, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Many hand-washing medicines are beneficial in reducing the spread of infections, corona viruses, and other congenital diseases; preventing ash disease; reducing systemic respiratory infection;
And there will be a decrease in the number of children born in the household.
A 2013 study shows that more than five years of age, it is better for children to grow to less than five years of age.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can lead to a decrease in the deaths of children due to respiratory diseases, such as the washing of soaps.
This simple action could reduce death to 50 % due to these diseases
Interventions that increase the urge to wash your hands can bring about a third of a drop in the death rate of the hostages, and it can be compared to clean water supply in less-income areas.
In the case of the death of asthma, it can be reduced to 48% due to the washing of soap, the only powerful and weak means to prevent the washing of soap and the severe respiratory infection (ARI) is a self-defense operation that can be performed in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
For example, among children under five years of age, one major cause of death is the ARI, which kills about 1.8 million children every year.
Ashale and model are the cause of the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
More lives can be saved by changing the habit of washing your hands in a natural environment before and after meals according to UNICEF, than by using a vaccine or medically measuring your intake, half of which is due to a decrease in your mortality rate and a quarter of which is due to severe respiratory infection.
Handwashing is part of the WASH program.
Keeping your hands clean also protects you from a quick illness that moves straight from July
A small loss of hand washing is that often hand washing can cause rapid loss of hand washing.
In a 2012 study in Denmark, handwashing can be faster than washing, which is called chambal or fast sweating, and which is common among people in the middle of the world.
Repeated wash hands are also seen as a sign of more anxiety (OCD) than needed
In one day, there are five subtle opportunities when washing your hands with soap is essential to reduce the disease that spreads through the mouth and mouth: after using the mouth of the Roman, after cleaning the child from under the child, before eating, before eating and after and before preparing food, and after or before touching the baby meat, fish or garlic.
Those other occasions when you have to wash your hands properly in order to avoid the movement of the disease include: before and after the wound is removed; after you pull, eat or clean your nose; after the administration of animal resources or animals; and after you touch the broken carcita.
In many countries the rate of soap wash is low
In 2015, an average of 38.7% of people living in homes wash their hands with soap in 54 countries. According to a 2014 study in Saudi Arabia, this is the highest rate: 97 percent; between the United States, 77 percent; and in China, the lowest rate is 23 percent. Many attitudes now change the way they wash their hands with soap in recent times.
In the Philippines, the required "Health Protection Program" is an example of progress in children's health and education.
This national program includes daily washing of soaps, fluoride and brushing of teeth twice a year.
Its application has been successfully implemented in Indonesia as well
In the process of rapid elimination, it has been better to mix soaps and detergents in water
The basic task of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to degradation and to increase the solution
Only water is not enough to clean quickly because the chine and the proteins, which are particles of non-nuclear soil, are not easily resolved in the water.
Clean, however, with the help of the proper flow of water..
In solid soap, because of reuse, bacteria can be present because of the past use.
A few studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soap say it can't be moved because bacteria only go out with frogs.
The CDC also says that "major soap is preferable without the control of the killers".
In the health community, antibacterial soaps have been highly promoted
There is no evidence yet that the recommended use of genetic drugs creates an anti-biotectic anomalies in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soaps contain common anti-bacterial agents, such as Truklosan, which is a threat to anthropogenic life.
So if the anti-bacterial soaps don't choose anti-biotect resistance, they won't be as effective as they're said to be.
In addition to toxic substances and quick preservation agents, more suitable forms such as pH regulators, german active binzoic acid (Scitic acid, Scorbac acid, Lactic acid) and quick condensers (elu virus, vitamin, manthal, plant enzymes). According to a detailed analysis by the University of Oregon, School of Public Health, simple soaps are the same users as anti-bacterial soaps for users who are able to protect themselves from diseases and remove bacteria by hand.
The hot water in which I am at ease is not so hot as to kill bacteria.
The bacterium levels increase faster than the body temperature (37°C)
However, natural oil, which stimulates soil and bacteria, is more powerful to remove half heat, soapy water cooler than soapy water
However, contrary to the public belief, scientific research says that half the hot water is not capable of reducing germs by hand.
A hand sensor or hand anti-septic is a hand-care agent based on non-water.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, the cleanup of alcoholic hands with no water (including those of alcoholic hands based on alcohol, those of creative hands, or Hand Sine Taser) began to become prominent.
Most isopropyl alcohols or ethanols that are added to a car manufacturer, such as Carbomer (a multi-annual average of octopus acid) in a prison material or in a refractory thing such as glaucoma for ease of use or use and reducing the effect of alcohol drought.
Adding acid to dissolved hydrogen increases the activity of antimicrobials, the hand sine Taser, which contains between 60 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Alcoholic Sine Tasers Bacteria, Multiple Adversary Bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TV B, and some viruses (HIV, Herps, RSV, Rayno Virus, Vaccine, Inflammation, Hepatitis) and Fangs kill
%99.97 bacteriums kill 30 seconds after using 35 decibels and 1 minute after using %99.99.999 to %99.999 bacteriums.
Alcohol-based hand-held sine Taser Light Virus or Norwalk is almost powerless, which is the most common cause of the underlying disease of the small brain, which is to be fully used on both hands of the mucous membrane or alcohol content.
In front of both hands and the back and between all the fingers and the back parts, about 30 seconds will be lost until the material, ink or jail is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly and should be rubbed on both hands. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with Sine Taser, especially when hands are clearly contaminated.
The quick reason for using such materials is the ability to kill easily and germs quickly; however, they should not consider changing the government's hands, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based sine taser can quickly dry away, until the formula includes a cream and/or quick-smiling formula.
Glycerin and/or other minerals may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experience has shown that using alcohol-based hand-held sine Taser, which includes cream, soap, or antimicrobial extracts, will reduce the amount of moisture and dryness.
Sometimes an allergy may be caused by various rapid diseases or excessive sensitivity to alcohol or by the involvement of alcoholic beverages.
He was pleased with them because of the water and the soap and the water that they used to wash their hands; this is because it is a light season for people who are ill.
Despite their effective defenses, waterless workers cannot clean up the matter, they only cleanse them with germs.
That's why the hand sine tartar is not more powerful than soap and water for the spread of many germs, because germs are in the hands.
Most of the influence of clean hands is dependent on parts and structures from alcohol, and historically they are not very effective.
In recent years, in structures used with binzel coim chloride, the overall antimicrobial activity has been seen after alcohol use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to rapid replication, has been reduced in its use.
In many societies, low-income people do not buy soap and use raw or clay instead.
Rush and soil can only be more powerful than water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or rust is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, rust is a healing agent because after meeting water, it makes an alkalinium solution.
WHO advises whether sand or soil is not
The proper way to wash your hands recommended for control and prevention of American diseases is to avoid spreading the disease, which includes the following:
“Stamp your hands for the sake of boiling hot water, or cold water.”
Many water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water is not different.
Swallow your hands with a reasonable amount of soap, your back, your fingertips, and the lower parts of your nose.
The soap quickly removes germs, and research has found that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of water.
Meet for at least 20 seconds.
Getting together creates stress, which helps to remove germs quickly, and removes more germs than getting longer.
Clean up a lot of water,
Wash hands in the pool can get dirty again.
“Purpose the dust with it, or let the wind dry up.”
The cheeks and palms can be easily re-polluted, usually in parts that are abandoned, between the fingertips, the fingertips, and the surrounding areas.
The design of the Nachan and the Neathrian Nile can be a combination of the Polish geractim.
Ninth Lunances are usually proposed to protect hands from drought; drought can cause rapid damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
Where there is no water and/or soap available, they may be provided with very low-cost facilities, such as a suction system or a lacquered green with suitable pipes, the use of water to insulate and/or grow in advanced countries when needed. In such a case, where water supply (such as school or developing countries) is reduced, water storage facilities such as "tippy-taps" or other low-cost ways of storing water are available.
Tippy-tap is a simple C technology that has a vessel that hangs from a rope and has a foot-and-mouthed larynx that pours a little water on a touch of hands and soap.
Drying hands is a part of the health function of the hand, but the issue is that public cleanliness has been the most powerful way to dry houses.
Many studies say that paper balances are better than electric drivers, which are often in clean rooms.
In 2008, the University of West Minister, London, commissioned a research project, and sponsored the paper-making industry, Europe's Tsho Sampozym, which included paper-making machines, hot-rolled hand dryers, and modern jet airhead drivers.
After the hand was dried up by a hand-washed and hot driver, an average of 194 per cent of bacteria in the fingertips increased and 254 per cent in the armpits.
As a result of the drying up of jet aircraft, 42% of the carbon dioxide in bacteria increased and 15% of the oxygen.
After the drying of hands and toes, the total number of bacteria on the feet of the finger had decreased by an average of %76 and by an average of 77 on the armpits. Scientists have also verified whether there is a capacity to spread pollution in the environment of other Wash Roma users and Wash Roma as a result of all types of drying.
The jet air driver, which is claimed to be at 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has the ability to release germs from the hands and joints and can contaminate the environment of other cleaners and cleaners up to 2 metres away.
The warmer hand driver can extend the gear from the driver to a distance of 0.25 metres.
No specific germs are spread out from TUV. In 2005, various ways of drying hands were examined in the study by TUV Product and Umwelt.
After drying the hand, the following changes were made in the number of bacteria:
Many hand dryers are made of different driers, and the driers are compared to paper scales
During the journey of soap and water, the hand is replaced by a wash-out paper
Sine tar based on alcohol contains at least 60 % alcohol.
He was forced to do so after examining his physical fitness in the hospital by Ignaz Semmelweis (1846).
There are clear tools that provide the hospital's activities to feed back to remember when they forget to wash their hands.
According to one study, their use resulted in a decrease in the rate of infection.
Medically wash your hands for at least 15 seconds, used in soap and water or jail for the purpose of becoming a mosquito and rubbing every part of your hand.
Let's put our fingers together and rub each other.
If there is a mail in the fingertips, it can be used to remove a heavy rainstorm
Since germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is necessary to wash it thoroughly and to dry it with a clean balance.
After drying, the paper balance should be used to close the water (and if necessary to open the door of return).
And their hands will not be defiled after that, ever.
The goal of washing hands in health care is to remove the pathogenic microorganisms ("Geratism") and prevent them from moving.
According to the New England General of Medicine report, the rate of handwashing in the medical environment is even low, and there is a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands before they usually touch them, thus allowing them to move the genes.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple methods reduce the rate of infection related to foot-and-mouth disease to %66. The World Health Organization has published a paper that shows the right way to wash and reach hands in the area of health.
The Agency's draft directive on hand cleaning can be found on their website for public comment
A related review was carried out through Whitby et al.
Commercial tools can check and verify hand-cleaning, if necessary
The World Health Organization has said "Five opportunities for washing":
When faced with a blood/blood transfusion
Before genetic decay, and
After taking care of the patient, the increase in the number of germs in the soap ("medicated or "antimicrobial" soap) is the task of killing germs by hand-washing agents.
There's a need for genetic damage where there's a lot of surgery before surgery or where anti-biotac attacks have a lot of life. For surgery, it's necessary to have a towel that can be opened and closed without touching, chlorhexidine or iodine, clean from the geniferous to dry after washing your hand, clean from the geniferous to rub off, and clean from the geniferous to clean the fingernails.
All jewelry will be removed.
In this process, the hands are washed up to the jaws, usually 6-2 minutes.
Long live (10 minutes) no longer required
When the water ransacked between them, they thought they would not go back.
When the hands are finished, the hands are washed clean and the sorghum is clothed.
It is better to reduce the spread of the germs than to wash your hands before you see the patient and then wash your hands or put your hands on the skin.
To control the staphylococcus infection in hospitals, research has found that the highest benefit of hand cleaning was the first 20 percent, and that when the rate was increased by %35, there was little extra benefit.
The use of simple soaps in relation to the transport of bacterial infectious diseases in food showed three times more effects than the use of antibacterial soap. Alcohol-based palaces and antibacterial soaps were found to have decreased by %26 in the contamination of bacteria every 30 seconds.
But H1N1 Inflammation A virus and Clostridium difficult spores are more powerful than alcohol-based soap and water is more powerful in health-related areas if the hand's health and cleanliness is improved, it will require staff training for hand washing, alcohol-based hospitals, and staff will be given written and linguistic memory.
In this context, more research is needed on how different health policies are more effective.
In advanced countries, soap is considered to have a low price, good health, and even a way to get good food,
However, water, soap and washing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces are a challenge for all because of the persistent lack of facilities to wash the world’s hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very good to have a ton of hands washed near a private or public toilet, although there are very few possible ways to make places of washing.
However, due to the lack of level of washing the hands, soap and water may also be a healthy habit rather than a lack of water.
The urge to wash your hands with soap can affect your decision-making, warn you about the benefits of washing your hands, and change your way of living.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this happen
As a result of an official study of 70 students, it was found that LMICs is more capable of working in a special community, while social marketing is less effective in a form of washing hands in schools is "three star approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soaps other than health care principles.
When they reach at least minimum standards, schools can reach the other and then the third star.
To build places of washing can be part of hand washing, which aims to reduce deaths in diseases and children.
The World Day of Smoking is another example of the warning of smoking, which aims to change attitudes as a result of the global plague of Corona Virus 2019-20, UNICEF has encouraged the use of handwashing.
Some studies have found it less difficult to wash hands collectively by ignoring DALYs in the developing countries.
However, according to one survey, water and the management of its crop is less difficult to produce from soaps.
The importance of washing hands for human health - especially for those who are in an insecure situation, such as mothers who have already given birth to the child or wounded soldiers in the hospital - the first two conservation of the hand identified in the middle of the 19th century: Hungary's fashion Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and another English Florence Nightingale, who is "the guardian of the modern Narsing."
At the time, most people still thought that the infection was harmful.
In 1980, due to disease and general health infection, Marquis of the U.S. disease control and prevention increased the effectiveness of hand-cleaning as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
In 2009 and 2020, the spread of global diseases of COVID-19 in many countries has promoted the warning that it is essential to wash hands from soaps to protect against such premature diseases
For example, posters of "right-hand washing techniques" were placed in the washrooms outside the public hall, on the roof of the office buildings, and on the airport in Germany.
This example of "Washing one's hands of" means that someone does not take responsibility for anything or say anything.
This illustration is related to Matthew from the Bible, where Pontius Pilate expressed dissatisfaction with the decision to put Jesus on the throne, but later became an example in the English-speaking community.
In the play of Shakespeare, Lady McBeath in McBeath is forced to wash her hands in an effort to clean up a thoughtful fire, which shows the guilt of conscience for killing her husband.
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more than others after remembering or meditating on immorality, and they take the washing of hands very seriously.
Moreover, those who wash their hands after such thoughts take little part in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religious guards also propose washing hands under health and symbolic purposes. The use of soapless water without washing their hands is a feature of many religions: such as confessional religions, Hindus, non-Jewish, Tulla, Natalith memory, Lababo Christianity and Islam. Religious guards propose to wash hands according to health, especially after some action.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is a matter of necessity after using tiles
And modesty, not slander, not insulting, Judaism and Islam are a matter of washing hands before and after every meal.
Control the risks of work locations for COVID-19
KOVID-19 is intended to provide back-to-back protection and health-related measures to prevent the risk of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Depending on the place of work and the nature of the work, the risk of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and those workers who may not be safe for COVID-19 depend on the nature of the risk of exposure.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety (OSHA), low-tech hazardous jobs are those where the public and others have less-than-car drivers, for which basic measures are proposed to protect against infection, including washing their hands, if workers are ill, encourage their home to stay, breathe, clean the work environment and clean the place of work.
There are jobs at risk of middle exposure that are in contact with people who do not know how to be affected by COVID-19, but can be affected by social migration and inter-international travel.
It includes workers who are contacted by the public, such as in schools, working environments in the population and more places across the board.
The main protective measures to protect against infection for this disease are to protect the air that is operated by the high-speed air filter, to protect it from the shooting, and if someone affected by COVID-19 is involved, personal protective equipment is available.
OSHA COVID-19 is a health care provider who is exposed to a person who is exposed to health care and death, and there is a lot of exposure if workers collect or maintain examples from a person who is aware of COVID-19.
For these workers, appropriate measures will be taken to overcome the risks, such as the low-pressure rooms of the wind and the low-speed rooms, and personal protective equipment of the type of work.
Many effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 may occur instead of working.
Workers may not be aware of the risks of disease, the protection of others, or the fear of being exposed to disease.
Trade patterns can change, both as a result of demand for materials and as a result of the demand for materials (such as purchases at low altitudes, or delay or drive speed facilities)
In the end, geographically, COVID-19 may interfere with the use of highly affected areas for the purpose of preparing for and renouncing mental illness.
Plans indicate levels of risk associated with work and employment, such as old or permanent medical conditions, the means of exposure, the home and the brotherhood, and the risks of individual workers.
They also call into question emergency plans for the situation resulting from the outbreak of the outbreaks of floods and floods that are necessary to address these dangers.
National or regional proposals may be the subject of plans to prepare and respond to chronic illness.
Reduce the transfer of staff in response to a disease, protect people who are at risk of health complications, and reduce the negative effects on business activities and supply.
The community in which business is taking place affects the response to the disease.
The Service's level of risk management is very active in the field of health and safety, so that the group can effectively control the risks.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, there are the most powerful controls that have been set up, followed by administrative controls, and in the end, personal protective equipment.
Setting up a branch in control, without relying on their attitude, is to eliminate the risks associated with work, and this may be the least affordable solution for the application.
I'm changing the policies and methods of administrative control, which require workers or masters.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but may help prevent some manifestations
The choice of all types of PPEs should be based on the risks involved, properly installed, if applicable (such as, take-offs), consistent and properly dressed, constantly suffering and changing, whatever the need, if properly removed, damaged to keep clean and clean, or to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA), low-exploited hazardous jobs in the public and others are less-exploited than drivers.
For all workplaces, basic measures to protect against infection are recommended to wash your hands again and completely, to encourage workers to stand at home if they are ill, to breathe properly and to clean up your face, to clean up your hair, to talk on the phone or, if necessary, to manage your frequent presence, to tear down other workers' tools and equipment, and to clean up and make up your workplace as usual.
There is a potentially dangerous step to protect other people in the presence of isolated workers, clients, visitors and workplaces.
America's Disease Control and Prevention Addiction (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe mental illness stay at home until they stop using at least 24 hours of medication or other symptoms without using drugs to reduce symptoms, and that disease-free policies are more likely to allow the patient to take care of the patient in the family, and that the country is aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the risks of middle-level exposure are those jobs in which people who do not know how to compete with or affect COVID-19 require close or continuous contact between six feet (1.8 m) and six feet (1.8 m) away, but may be affected by a community transfer around business or SARS-COV-2, or because of the current international travel of this person where COVID-19 has been transferred to a larger size than COVID-19.
It also includes personnel whose contact is with the public, such as schools, hospitals, hospitals, and places of employment. This includes the setting up of the most dangerous groups to control the installation of the highly functioning air filter, increasing the level of wind output, changing the level of air output, maintaining the means to protect the environment from radiation, and installing the equipment for the service of the residents. This and other groups of risk control means that patients should be encouraged to stand at home, to find the front measurement by chatting, often at work, to set up facilities where the needs of the COVID-19 are involved, and to manage the necessary procedures, to manage and manage the needs, to manage the needs and the needs of the personnel, to manage the needs, to manage the needs, and the needs of the personnel, to manage the needs and to manage the needs, to manage the needs and the needs, to manage the needs and the needs of the needs, to manage the needs, and the needs of the needs and the needs of the needs of the needs, and the needs of the needs and the needs of the needs of the people.
This group of people who are at risk has been exposed to the use of hormones.
If an individual gets sick on an aircraft, the proper control is to protect workers and other passengers, keep the patient apart from others until 6 feet away, cut off a staff member for the patient, and present the patient with a mask of face or tell the patient to wash his or her face and hands.
When a patient returns from a journey or touches the surface of the body or potentially contaminated surfaces, the ship’s operations should be exposed to Ebel and should be equipped with additional personal protective equipment if the patient is difficult to acquire, maintain, or breathe.
Handicrafts and other demonstrators want to destroy the body for this purpose, and polluted surfaces must be cleaned with clean and corrosive later: for commercial seaships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, it includes the risk of being combined in the form of a disease, and if they are seen separately and in the form of a plague or any other sign, they should immediately inform the medical centres on the ship.
The main thing is that medicine is in the patient's cabin, which recommends that the CDC be closed for a short period of time for the care of schools and children: if an affected person comes to the school building, even if he has not spread the virus, it will be cleaned clean or disinfected.
When the virus is transferred from a small to a medium-sized scale, the wisdom of social space can be applied to practitioners, such as external activities, assemblies, and other major assemblies, such as physical exercise or classes of music, or the elimination of food in coffee theaters, increasing the distance between the disks, limiting the time of entry and leave, avoiding unnecessary visits, and the use of a separate health office for children with such signs as accidents.
When they move to a large extent within the local community, the wisdom of social space can be considered for long-term school closures, as well as for long-term school closures. Law-enforcement practices that are carrying out their daily activities, according to the CDC, the risk of immediate health is reduced.
Law enforcement officers, who have to contact the people with COVID-19, are advised to comply with the guiding principles that are applicable to immigration tensions, including appropriate personal protection.
If there is close contact during fear, before re-use of the workers, using the spit or the anointing of the household cleaner, you should clean your David Belt and Geyer clean clean out clean and corrosive, and act on the standard method of importing the used PPE and removing the ingredients and washing the clothes.
According to OSHA, some health care workers and death rowers are at risk of more or more outbreaks.
Most of the dangerous jobs involved include health care, assistance, library, and medical transport workers who are known to COVID-19 or experienced by patients.
They become the risk of many outbreaks when workers perform the work of making Erosol, or gather or manage examples of known or complex COVID-19 patients.
In the work of creating Erosol, integrating nalli, treating the method of the stomach, measuring the gills, collecting some dental practices and values, or collecting unpleasant examples.
More hazardous work in the mortuary includes those who prepare dead bodies known to be COVID-19 at the time of death; these dangerous groups include additional controls, including COVID-19, which should be separated for patients, including those who are aware of how to build Erosol.
Some health - care devices may be suitable for particularly low - pressure air in homes and homes.
Examples should be touched by the safety measures of the Bayou Safe Leul 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be separated into special places depending on whether they are investigating COVID-19 cases other than PPE, OSHA recommends breathing for those who know patients or SARS-COV-2 working at 6 feet away, and those who perform the action
In the light of a common and written protection program in the U.S., NIOSH would like to use the N95 filtering system or better than it, which includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of ghosts can provide better protection and improve the rest of the workers. WHO does not recommend completely hiding, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not moving from the body’s immune system.
WHO only recommends sorghum masks instead of login screens for operation
People who are collecting samples of themselves, looking at or moving without the way in which COVID-19 patients develop Erosol, WHO recommends shields, goons and hands for them, surgical masks, inks, or facials
If the method of development is performed, then take N95 or FFP2 instead of the surgical mask.
Knowing that the PPE's global response is insufficient, WHO telemedicines, material barriers, just allowing them to enter the room, who are directly looking at the COVID-19 patients, need to use the PPE for a specific purpose, taking care of many patients with the same disease, using the same non-replaced person, maintaining the PPE's support for the maintenance and management of China, and encouraging the use of the masks of non-significant people.

We're faced with an unusual situation this month.
The global plague of COVID-19 is the one that has revealed that man is by chance rooted and we are responsible for each other.
We don't have any examples before such a challenge, but we know very well that our best response to the global action is to feel, cooperate, and build a society that is in the spirit of this organization.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we've seen in all of our cars in e-mail, phone calls and chats, all of this is the truth of how happy we are to work with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful than that, and I can't feel proud that you're all my friends.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
They reminded me how much it's worth for the world to have to go back to the doctor's office now, and how strong a sign of this is that everyone has access to it.
Your work has made it possible, whether you're with sites or our cars that are paid or our community is safe.
The world needs information, and Vicki Pedia provides it, more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world
The importance of this mission and your role in it, we'll make some important changes this week to how we work together.
Changes in Our Work and Schedule
As Robyn said earlier, our view of the coming days and months and our conversation on schedule was met last night by the c-team.
In this conversation, we've considered how the most appropriate response to what we're facing will be and how to keep the organization on our feet.
We wanted to put an end to the tension and promote our mission for a long time.
If you want to deal, okay.
All staff, staff and employees:
Our daily expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the second order,
We're not announcing vacations -- if you can work according to normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, nothing can be said about the world at this time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, trade must be bought, or to go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not rocking your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
We don't have to say it, but we're saying it.
There's no need for disease dates or PTOs - just tell your manager and help build your team's calendar and schedule, all aspects of the task of making sure.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, inform Bryan in T&C Ops, you can help with T&C and make sure that the management takes proper care of your situation).
Friends who work for hours will be paid.
We've said this before, and we're going to call back the staff who's working on our accounts.
Each person will be paid for his hours during normal circumstances.
It includes that if you are sick or unable to work
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people work around the world to change their mind.
What we can do is impossible to be sure of, especially in such days.
Again, it's all for your personal protection.
We just have to say that you talk to your manager, so we'll figure out what to expect of you and then figure out what to do with it.
Some things are considered necessary
There are some things we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fund-raising teams work hard (except for others), which may need additional support
We need to change our focus with all areas of research into the current goals and help with what our mission needs.
We all have a lot to do, we'll all focus on very important projects.
We won't get tired of slowing down at this point.
We're not planning to "fill the rain" once this world is gone.
You're not supposed to be working extra time to fill up on Dad's lines, which is not real at the time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate we will work to determine the new terms and times line
What is the state of Qaf.
To arrange our new reality and daily working times, we want to plan our 2020-2021 annual plan
We want to expand our 2019-2020 project, which takes more time to make a budget where workers will be allowed to change their work preferences, and give their loved ones the opportunity to adjust to those who want to work for a short time.
This expansion of time will greatly reduce the work and pressure of the current project in the whole organization.
We'll let the board know about our plan next week and let the team know when we get confirmation about the next steps.
Thank you for taking over the AP team.
Official status, appearance, and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that our resident friend COVID-19 may be affected by an F.S.F.
However, despite a lot of caution, we used an anti-virus operation in the San Francisco office to clean up all the surfaces.
They used the creative hospital of a hospital degree to clean up the arms of each level of the generals and steps through which we can access our quests.
This building uses its protocols of its own by-laws, which represent the protection of its creators.
We feel at rest that the office will be in a state of readiness when we decide to come back.
Our D.C. Office is located in the V.R., which has shared all the D.C.O.A. and our S.A.'s COVID-19 protocol.
By the first week of Abi, our D.C. office had gone to a faraway place, which is named after the Franciscan Squad.
As our daughters know to live in the U.S.C., we're doing laundry in Brooklyn in one place.
These are conversations that are ongoing. In fact, they can take a while.
Our girls are working the first time.
Our old people know that this girl can be adjusted and they want to advise you.
The number of visits can be extended for more than one hour or two.
If there is a need for long seats, consider how to distribute them on different days.
Explain the meeting as each agenda, and first send the contents.
Create a video that will be used by default to help you access and access web pages like Google Docs and Zoom.
Get the best help for each meeting, someone needs to monitor the debate on questions and identify the target list and help you get a note (or close notes with each other).
If you need a quiet ten headset, send an e-mail to technical support.
Use your own success for Synix.
I'm in the #Remote channel to talk about the work shared with my partners.
The HR Practical Team Weber is looking at the Erognomaks Guide to be involved in the distribution of the entire Foundation
Last week, we told all the social abusers that he had received public events, such as the abolition of Edithates, until the World Health Organization announced the end of this global plague.
They need to know that we understand that our request for withdrawal and other prohibitions can enable them to complete the support activities they have accepted and that there will be no blame for any change or weakness in these offerings.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on Wykiya and other regional and regional social conferences.
The common feelings of the entire world brotherhood are strong on this issue, but they are confident of the clear ability to focus on their own brothers, the Wick Media Association.
While growing up, C.R.T.M.A. is working on a web page to provide the community with the opportunity to monitor and monitor their savvy potential.
Keep in touch with issues related to COVID-19.
We'll send your calendar next Thursday 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT for a special visit
We will then use it to share the latest information, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We're going to help each other.
During this time, you can continue to obtain more information about COVID-19 on this email and the office.
C RT this page will keep all the latest and other information in one place at a time.
We are working on the permanent establishment of those working parties who are now living in countries that are quite affected.
If you are traveling, attending, having an important job, or having a courier challenge or anything else you need to help, don't hesitate to work and receive notifications from Brahn Kerm C.R.T.
We're here to provide you with the necessary assistance and contacts.
If you have any secret or sensitive issues, email Brahr Kerm Bryan Jordan, Director of the H.R. International Global Operation.
None of these changes should be allowed to interfere with our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they know one at this time. Our work and responsibilities will need to be done in a way that we have not done in the past.
These are measures that we can see that it is necessary to help one another so that we do not continue to work, to provide our motivations with what it needs, and to serve the world they depend on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us there.
Now, it takes time to help each other and take the opportunity to do important work that will come in the next few weeks, but possibly come in a few months.
We all need you to do this, and that's why you need to take care of yourself and your family so that when you need it, you're ready in the best condition.
Now, please, shake your hands and don't rub your face!
Catherine, C.R.T. (Amanda, M.V., B.J.D., Grigory V, J.V., Joel L., L.R., R.M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the team (GertI, Head of the World), J.V., Gene Jo, L.S., Rubin A, R.M., and Tuby An).
B Injectins - enzyme converter 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is associated with the outer surface of the cells (the linings of the body) in the lungs, the shingles, the heart, the cervix and the intestines.
ACE2 converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of enzyme II and by increasing the number (1-7), makes it a reliable cure for heart disease. ACE2 is also used as an entry point for coronary cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2
Enjutants converting enzyme 2 is a type of gene that contains metallonase that is found on the endothelial surface and in the rest of the cells.
ACE2 proteins include a terminal peptide IM2 domain and a terminal electorate Renal Ameno ESD transport domain.
ACE2 is a complex with Type I long protein, which is absorbed on the surface of the cells and on other roots by its sickly active domain.
The domain outside the ACE2 cells is released by another enzyme through the Trans membrane domain called ledsis, and as a result, the dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream, which eventually exits through the bloodstream.
ACE2 is found in more than one member: ACE2 consists mainly of Type II fibrous cells, small atoms' entrites, arterial and vironous indwelling cells and arterial soft spines.
The effect of the ACE2 M AA is also found in the brain’s outer brain, the body’s bulwark, at the bottom of the canyon, and in the brain system.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the ACE's aggregate balance
A.E. Engineers I Harmon is enough in the blood vessels of Injectors II.
ACE2 converts carbon terminal amino acid phenylene from Injection II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into a vasodilator injection (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 also separates several other peptides, including [Dis-Or] -Bridicalen, Applen, Neurotension, Dinwarf A, and Villain
ACE2 also controls the copy of SLC6A19's natural amino acid and is infected with brain disease.
As a long-lasting protein, ACE2 acts as a central entry in a few coronavirus cells, including HCV-NL63; SARS-COV; and SARS-COV-2 (or virus caused by COVID-19).
In particular, on the surface of the S1 proteins of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, the release of the spicy S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 is a result of the migration of the mucous membranes into the inside of a cell, causing both viruses and enzymatic cells to move.
The intervention also needs Sprotin's priority through TMPRSS2, which is currently being used as a therapeutic treatment, and some have concluded that the reduction in the level of ACE2 in cells can make it easier to cope with disease.
However, a number of leading and organizing societies and agencies have advised not to continue to be infected with ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
On 11 July 2012, an organization review and meta-analysis published in 2012 found that "the use of anti-control barriers in the risk of exacerbation was significant in lower than the control."
In addition, there is a risk of exacerbation in patients who have been treated with ACE inhibitors, who are at risk of exacerbation, especially those who have been treated with phlegms and heart disease.
A.E.O.O.D. is less related to deaths, although its results were less strong than the overall risk of deaths."
Human activity ACE2 (rhACE2) is turned into a modern treatment for severe wound wounds, and it has been shown that it will improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with symptoms of severe respiratory pain with a lipopolysaccharide.
Half of the human life rhACE2 is about 10 hours and 24 hours of effect (darkness) starts in 30 minutes.
A number of results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better cure for untreated patients with classical Rhino-Angiotensin System (RAS) prevention, or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II is increased – the rise of rhACE2 fever has been observed during severe respiratory disease.
B'COVID-19 AP are mobile applicators who assist in communication during the global plague of Coronary 2019-20, such as the identification of people who have been in contact with an affected person.
Numerous such applications have been or have been proposed in various areas and regions with the support of the government.
Several applications are being developed to find contacts
The concerns of secrecy have been revealed, especially about the system for the geographic location of the app user.
The low-intensity exchange includes the use of Bluetooth signals to move the user's home and home to other mobile phones.
Google and Apple announced on 10 April 2020 that they will assist in migrating applications based on this kind of bottua into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has created an AP, with the support of AliP, which allows citizens to know whether they were in contact with someone affected by COVID-19.
These are used in more than 200 cities in China. Tris Toughard is being used in Padapore.
This AP created a local IT brotherhood, which was launched as a free media and will be referred to the government. northern Macedonia has launched an AP based on Bolota, which can identify the potential impactors' closeness and provide an immediate response to health-care authorities.
This is the product that has been prepared by the EP Health Notices and Technology and Health.
April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval of the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store
On April 12, the government announced that the R & D app is in the next stage of preparation and will be available for payment within a week – Ireland and France are planning this kind of "Step Code" application.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering the preparation of applications based on the Tris Toughid App and the Bluetooth Protocol – the intention is to introduce Jeffinsing App to the patients identified by COVID-19 in Russia to ensure that people do not leave their homes.
Professor Ross Anderson of the University of Safety Engineering of Cambridge has identified a number of possible operational difficulties in systems based on the AP, including negative positive results and low impact, as well as limited use of the app to a small population.
By eliminating concerns about the spread of the "Coronavirus" app, Apple has defined limits on what types of organizations can include applications related to Coronavirus in their app store, limited them only to "government" or otherwise known organizations.
Google and Amazon have thus banned
Secretaries have expressed their concern about the successive restrictions of surveillance on the Coronary App, especially about whether the arrangements of surveillance designed to deal with the global plague will be removed after the end of the threat.
The Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that has called for the limitation of such oversight arrangements.
These leaders have declared strict conditions on government plans:
Monitoring must be "legal, necessary and appropriate";
The scope of surveillance and observation should be for a specific period of time:
The use of data will only be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
The protection of data and the name shall be protected and the protection shall be demonstrated on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid over-ethnic and non-significant behaviour;
A third party has to clarify under foreign law the SAT data;
Protective measures against abuses will be taken and citizens will be entitled to respond to abuses;
All "local participants" will need to be involved, including experts from public health and non-essential groups -- German causation computer club (CCC) and non-border writer (Reporter Ohen Grinzin) (RSF) -- also have lists of controls.
The Google/ Apple shell project from your operating system, when it is not needed, wants to eliminate the monitoring process and solve the problem of permanent monitoring
The girls were using a network-based castle control system, which eliminates both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid surveillance.
The system of network-based monitoring was adopted in Israel.
Network-based solutions, where opportunities for access to unintelligible data in the palace, are important issues of confidentiality.
Of course, the system of central servers does not need access to the personal data of the palace; numerous secrecy protection systems have been created that only use central servers for information (show the bottom part).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to communicate.
Instead of using a better application, the system collects monitoring information from different media, including data from monitoring data and card exchanges, and collects them all by means of text messages for potential impactors.
In addition to using this information, the government has publicly provided information on the opportunity to warn possible tradition, which is what the secrecy of the information laws has been given because of the far-reaching changes in the situation in the country when the scourge of MRS has erupted.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites – countries such as Germany have considered both central and secret security systems.
On April 6, 2020, her details were not updated.
It's a better idea to keep a secret, with a long history of research education at least until at least 2013 by April 7, 2020, more than one degree of friendly secret, such as the use of low-power (BLE) by a group of experts, who were working on accessing the user's palace from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a laborious effort that consists of both central and non-major methods, and it is not a single protocol in the non-major protocol: non-major secrecy protection watch (DP-PPT / DP-3T) communication number (TCN,fka unit contact number, CEN), sensitivity protocol and mobile contact (PACT) and others.
The personal data identified in these protocols never goes out of the way and is all mixed up.
In the MIT media library, the secret group is preparing safe ways to collect and use data from the site or the road robbery to facilitate the expansion of COVID-19.
It is based on an investigation conducted in March 2020 by the "Epis Guen Disease: Personal Security in the Disease", a second effort by Angamma M.P., a secret technology-making company that was originally set up in the IM media library.
Safe Tress uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users without having any understanding of the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the foundation of the Global TC Association was set up by groups that met together to achieve the same goal and that were highly targeted protocols to reduce the drug supply to enable monitoring and processing apps to operate globally, which is an important aspect of large-scale gambling.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Padapore announced that they have released the application used by its government, the Bluetooth application.
On April 10, 2020, Andreid and iOS mobile platform companies, Google and Apple, announced an action to launch the communication, which, according to their claim, will preserve the secret based on the combination of low-boluth energy technology and the secret secret signage.
They also published data on the technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system wants to explore in three stages:
Governments will be able to ensure that they are able to pay for the official protection of the secrets of the search for Koronairs through these protocols.
Google and Apple want to solve the problems of permanent surveillance through direct input into the iOS and Android of this activity so that the first system will be distributed through the new operating system, and then removed as soon as the threat is removed.
Change in dosage (which aims to change the treatment, to re-make profiles, to change the treatment or to change the treatment) is to change or use the condition of another treatment for one disease, rather than to use the medicine for the disease for which it was actually prepared.
This is an online science research that is currently being conducted to investigate the powerful and safe treatment of COVID-19.
In other areas of research, the preparation of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of healthy plasmas includes approximately 66 possible doses of proteins in SARS-COV-2, each of which includes numerous annual service sites.

This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they want to avoid.
For another unusual experience in Australia, 4,170 doctors are being introduced into the field.
The vaccine may not be safe or effective during preparation.
Using the examples of specific animals of COVID-19 to test the effectiveness of the vaccine, such as ACE2-duration, other laboratory animals and non-human creatures, we need to indicate the need for emergency measures to prevent live viruses of grade 3 and to ensure the standard method of protection.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models of non-humanity.
By April 2020, SARS has not found any safe vaccine or treatment that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a published research report in 2005 and 2006, the identification and preparation of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment is preferring foreign governments and public agencies. There is no proven vaccine for the treatment of MERS.
When MRS went off, it was thought that the current SARS research would be a useful example in the preparation of cures and vaccines.
By April 2020, a MRS vaccine (DNA-based) was developed to complete phase I medical trials on humans and three more, all vectored viral vaccine, two AdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and an MVA-MERS-S.
Social media posts have promoted a fantasy idea that the virus of COVID-19 is known and its vaccine is already available.
In various social media posts, the current patents of genetics and vaccines in the penthouses have been referred to as the SARS Coronnaires.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an advanced disease that is caused by severe respiratory disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The common symptoms include hunger, humanity, and breath retention.
Other symptoms include hives, pain in the joints, hives, sore throat, swelling of the throat, and pain in the stomach
From appearance to onset of symptoms usually takes five days, but can last from two to forty days.
Although in many cases symptoms of disease are of a minor nature, the girl goes to the failure of viral models and members
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million people and areas have reported events, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have become healthy -- mainly through close contact in the community, often in the form of a little bit of mouth-to-mouth pain when they talk, sneezing or talking.
Even though the BI comes out when breathing out, they often fall on the ground or on the ground, instead they can get sick from a distance.
After rubbing the affected surface with your hands, nose, or face, people may get infected with this disease.
It can live for 72 hours on virus levels.
Within three days of the onset of symptoms, this is the most serious disease, even though it may be spread in the post-disease phase before and after symptoms may be the standard method of identifying it in order to produce data on the behavior of the temporary resource transcript polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is given to people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and who are health professionals.
There is a difference in the proposal to wear a mask for the general public, which is that girls are against using it, that girls are advised to use it, and that girls are making it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or special antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has recorded the local transmission of the disease in most of the countries of health.
It may not be possible to show symptoms in people affected by the virus or to experience symptoms such as fever, human suffering, stroke, and breathing.
Respiratory pain, chest pain, or pressure, mental confusion, confusion, and blueness of face or face; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is advised.
In the upper part of the pancreas, symptoms such as itching, nose or throat may be healed.
The symptoms of the disease in the area were seen in various percentages, such as moths, whales, and elephants.
In early China, there were only a few cases of chest pain and chest pain.
In the case of a girl, this disease may be an example of the failure of more members and the path of death.
It's called the incubation drain.
For COVID-19, the duration of the incubation is usually five days, but it can take 14 days to complete.
97.5% of those who show signs of disease will be affected within 11.5 days.
Without signs, these affected people are not fully aware of the disease; however, early witnesses show that they may be susceptible to it.
People affected by this disease are currently unknown with no evidence and are being studied, where KCDC has reported that% of all cases confirmed during hospital stay without symptoms.
The National Health Commission of China began to count the events without symptoms from April 1 in its daily affairs; on that day, 130 of the 166 affected patients were tested for symptoms.
In Touk and Bulgam, the viral load may be more high.
Speaking out loud is more like talking out loud than usual.
A study in Padapore found that the capacity to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) in the human body is not limited to the human body.
Although this virus is not the same, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bypass transfer can be possible and that there are positive examples of viral RNA among those who have gathered outside their rooms.
Some medical methods, such as intuition and card pulmonary resolution (CPR) can dissolve respiratory disorders and can spread into the wind.
Now that the fears are that it spreads out from the brain, it's considered less dangerous when people show signs, then the virus is the most expensive; and if it's possible to spread the virus before the symptoms appear, it's less dangerous.
Europe's disease prevention and control center (ECDC) says that now that it's not quite clear how easily it spreads, a person usually affects two or three people. The virus can live on different levels for days.
In particular, one day on the virus gene, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), up to three days, and 99% on tobacco were found to be viable for four hours.
However, it's changing from temperature to temperature.
If soap and detergents are properly used, they are effective; soap’s designs make the infected protective layer of the virus inactive, and they clean the virus quickly and from other surfaces.
Other hospitals, Hish Binzconim Chloride and Colory-Eight Glaconite (one injured person) were less effective in a Hong Kong study, the average of two days before entering the hospital.
Of the six patients, the first was the most viral load, and the sixth was the most virus in the next day's test.
The manifestation of symptoms of severe respiratory pain in Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a severe novellic disease in Coronavirus, which was first discovered in three people with a pattern of severe respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are present in the associated coronation.
Outside of the human body, the virus houses are destroyed by soap, which breaks its protective bubbles, and the SARS-COV-2 is similar to the actual SARS-COV.
Peanuts are the members that are most affected by COVID-19 because they access these host cells by means of a virus-reducing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found to be the most common type II cells in the host cell.
Thanks to a special area called "Cyl" (Peplomer) for causing virus ACE2 and entering the host cell.
In the city of Vovaan, China, 12% of those affected were heart attacks and were severely ill.
As the disease develops in the entire body, there is a higher rate of heart symptoms due to the disease of the immune system, but the heart rate of severe heart disease may also be related to ACE2 owners.
2ACE is more evident in the heart and it's part of what's in the heart.
Most of the patients affected by COVID-19 have seen more cases of blood clotting (31%) and toromambolism (25%) in the caretakers of the group affected by COVID-19. The death of the post-mortem victims of COVID-19 was reported to have been severely damaged by the outbreak of covert damage (DDD) and the social problem.
While SARS-COV-2 has a focus on the appearance of ACE2 breath-neutrophetic cells, there are more signs of shock in patients affected than in patients affected by COVID-19.
In particular, a diseased SM-SF secreting T-cream in patients affected by COVID-19 has been linked to a new outbreak of Sussi I-L-6 and severe outbreaks.
During the post-Martam, there were reports of the involvement of the large crowd.
WHO has published a number of ways to test the disease
The standard method of experience is the resource transcription polymers Chinese regression (rRT-PCR)
The test is usually done on samples of breath derived from the inferno; however, the example of the nose or thoch may also be used.
The results are usually available within two days of a few hours.
A blood test can be used, but it takes two samples in two weeks, and the results are immediately reduced.
China's Science Dan Korona Iris was successful in separating a type of Iris and publishing a genetic order to prepare a response to polymers from the rest of the world to identify the infectious disease from Iris.
By April 4, 2020, the Anti-Body Test (which identifies the active viral disease and has been affected in the past) was under preparation, but has not yet been used to an extensive extent.
China's test experience showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The F.D.A. approved the first test center of screening to be used at the end of the month in the United States on 21 March 2020. Zungnan Hospital of the University of Wahan continued to provide medical guidance to identify the disease, taking into account the risk of the disease.
Two-sided homes in the original infection, the ground glass opiates are common, inappropriate, and later split.
As the disease grows, the complete victory, the crucifixion, and the stables can be seen.
There are some statistics available on the eating disorders of COVID-19 and pathophysiology
Post martam has important personal results:
Macroscopies: the swelling of the pancreas, the swelling of the heart, the strength of the pancreas and the swelling of the pancreas.
The four types of wire can be seen:
Easy example: to become more of a nuisance, to become more of a nuisance, to form a large non-normal nuisance, to produce a large amount of soft cells, and to form a large amount of embossed cells.
Great example: Reduce the loss of chits (DD) by reducing the loss of chits.
The symptoms of severe respiratory pain (RD) and the lack of oxygen in the body are very low.
Example: The organization of casts in the Aeolar deeps and the pluminary mediums
Blood: Blood clotting (DIC); White and Red blood reaction.
Careful planning to reduce the risk of disease, avoid areas of the flock, wash the soap and water again and again, and wash for at least 20 seconds, keep your breath healthy, and avoid rubbing your eyes, nose or mouth
The CD suggests that the face and nose should be covered with a brush when it is being brushed or brushed, and that if the brush is not available, it should use the inside of the skin.
Adequate care for the hand is encouraged after a pregnancy or a checkup
The D.C. proposed wearing clothing to cover his face in the flock, to limit the spread of viruses from people who do not show signs. The aim of social media professionals is to shut down schools and offices, to ban travel bans and to eliminate large public gatherings and to reduce contact with large groups of affected people.
The distance management manual also includes at least 6 feet (1.8 m) of people living at a distance of at least
No major treatment for COVID-19 was found, since the vaccine was not expected until 2021, COVID-19 should be reduced to the highest level of the plague, which is called "filling".
The CDC also suggests that people wash their hands again and again from soap and water for 20 seconds, especially when they are at home, or when their hands are obviously dirty, before eating, and after cleaning, rubbing or pulling.
It further suggests that at least 60% of hand-based hand-held sensors should be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available in areas where commercial hand-held sensors are not readily available, WHO provides two formulae for local production.
In these forms, antimicrobials come from activity, ethanol, and esuprol.
In alcohol, hydrogen oxide is used to help eliminate bacteria; it is not "an active substance for the occurrence of bacteria."
Gallicul is cast as a form
People have been provided with protective care, including support for environmental care, oxygen treatment, and other important impactors.
The CD has suggested that those who doubt that they are affected by the virus wear a simple mask.
In the U.S., unsaturated carbon dioxide (A.M.) has been used to solve the barrier mass solution, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal care is designed to improve health and a healthy way of life and better food resistance.
In the early stages of the plague, relief treatment can be used among people with mild symptoms. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people entering the hospital with COVID-19.
Vulnerable people in the U.S. and plague doctors have posted a free resource from various agencies to IBCs.
By April 2020, there was no specific cure for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts proposed parasitamol as an important treatment instead of ebiprofen.
Care must be taken to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in the medical environment, when there is a medical operation that creates an operation that causes an insomnia like an insomnia or an operation to blow out of the hand.
For the medical treatment of people affected by COVID-19, the CDC proposes to keep the person in the Arab Infestation Rome (AIR) in addition to the alert for communication, communication and wind-producing germs. The CDC also provides instructions for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during World War II.
Proposed design is: P.P.P.G., the muscle or face, the eyeguard, and the medical care.
N95 has been approved as an industrial environment, but FDA has allowed this mask to be used only under a mandatory license.
They've been prepared to protect themselves from dust like the wind, but they don't have a guarantee that they'll be able to use an unintended biological agent.
When the mask is not available, suggests using the DC face mask or home-made mask as the last support.
Most people affected by COVID-19 are not so bad that they need mechanical ventilation or change, but some percent of patients need
An active study is being conducted on the type of support of the person entering the hospital for respiratory failure related to COVID-19, with some evidence that the canal or two-sided positive operation of the upper naphtha can be protected from induction.
Not knowing that both of them benefit from the same kind of disease.
When available, some doctors prefer unfavourable machine death because this method limits the spread of air levels in adults (of which are over 60 years of age and in particular those over 80 years).
There are no beds available in the developed countries, which limit the capacity to maintain an increase in patients affected by COVID-19 in the health system who need to enter the hospital.
According to one study, 5% of Chinese people were admitted to the care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died.
30 per cent of people affected by COVID-19 in China are finally admitted to a highly supervised unit.
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complex because in COVID-19, severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) increases and oxygen is rapidly becoming difficult.
Pressure-response mode and high-PP fans need to reduce the risk of damage to the air and to reduce the risk of air retention.
No more PCs are available on the old fan.
Research for possible treatment was started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the course of medical experience
Reimdissier is most hopeful.
Although it may take up to 2021 time to become a new drug, many of the medicines that are being used are already intended for other use or are already in the process of modern experience.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in patients with severe disease
WHO suggests that volunteers take part in possible medical examinations and safety experiences. If D.A. has artificially authorized the experimental use of healthy people’s plasma in a case where a person’s life is seriously or rapidly threatened.
This did not go through medical studies to prove itself safe and powerful for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter their name and identification number
This can indicate the potential risk of infection by using an AP surveillance number.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If the potential danger arises, the app proposes not only to cortinate itself, it also manages local medical contractors. The affected people and South Korea, Taiwan and Japan use data from the mobile phone, facial identification technology, mobile phone dialing, and large data polls on the intellectual mind.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to process the mobile phone data of people who should be coronary.
These measures have been taken to protect and protect the people who are affected by contact with citizens.
Even in March 2020, Dutch telework identified the data collected from the German government's agency Robert Small Institute Tweet to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
Russia has designated a technology that recognizes the face to identify the Cortanian fractures.
The Italian Regional Health Authority said they were informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are walking around."
At the end of the week, the German government held 48 hours of peace with 42,000 hopefuls.
President Christine Trullid of Estonia also called on the international community to resolve the problem of the spread of coral reefs.
It may be that people have problems with quarantine, travel restrictions, medical effects or fear of illness themselves.
Referring to Rory and Kohr, the BBC said: "The social distances, loneliness, health concerns, mental pressures and economic woes are the total destruction of people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can be slightly affected by something or without any sign, which is similar to the diseases of the other common soul, such as the common grave.
Usually, patients get healthy in two weeks, while patients with severe or severe diseases get healthy in three to six weeks.
Based on data from other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at greater risk than COVID-19, but no COVID-19 data are available. In some people, COVID-19 outbreaks affect the cause of the disease.
In highly affected individuals, COVID-19 can change to a high-speed respiratory disease (RDS) that could lead to respiratory failure, body burning, or a number of limb failure.
COVID-19-related complications include the burning of the body, unusual blood clotting, and damage to the heart, circumference, and brain
Non-prescription of blood, especially in 6% of COVID-19 patients, was found to be increased during the period of breast-feeding, when 4% of patients in this group were found not to work as usual.
The impact of COVID-19 on approximately 20-30% of people showed greater levels of liver disease (transaminesis).
According to the same documents, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, from which five days went to the hospital.
However, it was seven days between the hospital entry and death in the patients transferred to the highly supervised unit.
In a study of early patients, the mean duration of death was 14 days, with a total of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (CHC), men had 2.8% of deaths while women had 1.7%.
After the death of the bats, the medical condition of the bats caused widespread damage to the presence of the wind in the bats with small oils in the family of Phrybromizide.
Changes in animal virus disease have been observed in neurosistes
The image of the bats is similar to the symptoms of the acute pain of the breath (RD)
According to the National Health Commission of China, %11.8 deaths were seen due to higher levels of tropics or heart rate.
According to the statistics in the United States of America, 89% of patients who entered the hospital had pre-existing female diseases, including the availability of medical resources and the social economy of the letter could have an impact on the death rate.
The ratio of deaths is different due to local changes, but this may also be due to difficulties in the process.
The lower number of patients in general may be due to an increase in mortality.
But the fact that these deaths are the result of the diseases that have already occurred in it means that the current conditions have been reduced.
The incidence of severe signs of COVID-19 among smokers was 1.4 times greater, and the need for extreme care or death rates was 2.4 times greater than among non-smokers. Concerns about the long-term effects of the disease have been raised.
The administration of Hong Kong Hospital saw a 20% to 30% reduction in the capacity of some people who have been diagnosed with disease, and the prevalence of outbreaks indicated a loss of limbs.
This may be the result of very careful signs of post-healing.
By the end of March 2020, it was not known that it had long-standing resistance to chronic illness in healthy people.
Other Koronana irs are likely to be seen as a result of force resistance, but there are also cases where the positive results of Coronairas have been found after the cure since COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worse because of the long-term disease rather than the disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and has started as an animal disease.
It does not have the basic component, but by December 2019, the spread of the disease was almost completely human-to-human transfer.
A study of 41 major events prior to COVID-19, published at the launch in January 2020, shows that the first event of symptoms was held on 1 December 2019.
WHO's official publications announced that December 8th 2019 is the first history of the beginning of the disease.
Laws usually take several steps to determine the death.
These numbers are changing the time and time of the letter, and the number of tests, the standard of health care, medical powers, the beginning of the plague, the beginning of time and the characteristics of the population are influenced by age, sexual and social health.
At the end of 2019, WHO commissioned the death of Hungary ICD-10 disease code U07.1, confirmed by the library by SARS-COV-2, and ordered the death of COVID-19 from COVID-19 without confirmation of the disease. The death and occurrence ratio are reduced to the confirmed number of deaths at a particular time.
Based on the data from John Hopkins University, by April 17, 2020, World Deaths and Events were %6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
The number of events is different from the letter. Other measures include death rates (FRs), which represent the percentage of deaths in the confirmed person, and the percentage of deaths in the affected person (FRs), which reflects the percentage of deaths in the affected person (recognised and unaccredited).
These figures are not for a specific period of time and include a specific population from disease to solution.
While not all affected individuals appear anti-buddies, the presence of anti-buddies may provide information on how many people have been affected.
In central Italy, 4600 people live in a small village, Castaglian D. Ada, whose 80 (1.7%) people are already dead.
In the gonglet, disease spread due to the holidays of Catholic Christians, and it spread to fewer people, which caused relatively few deaths, and it is not necessary that all deaths from COVID-19 have not been reduced to such a degree.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients can have antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
69 (0.004 per cent of eternity) has confirmed death from COVID-19.
Men and women have different effects on the world's health and mortality rates.
Studies in China and Italy show that men are more likely to die.
The greatest danger among men was 50 years of age, when the difference between men and women was only 90.
In China, men's deaths were 2.8 percent and women were 1.7 percent.
The basic materials of this sexual difference are not known, but genetics and vision can be a common cause.
Gender-based immunological changes, low use of tobacco in women and men, and the birth of other diseases in women, such as low blood pressure in the american population, can lead to an increase in men's mortality rates.
In Europe, as many as 57 affected men were and as many as 72 died from COVID-19.
By April 2020, the U.S. government has not been looking for data on COVID-19 disease.
Research has found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in a comprehensive manner.
More than one percent of the medical professions, especially ninety women, are more likely to be affected by the virus.
The World Health Agency announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO President Theodores Adnom Grabiss explained the CO of Corona, VI of Virus, D of Disease, and from 19 the day the first event occurred: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to prevent the name of a particular geographic palace and cave (also known as China), the animal type, or the group of people, taking into account international recommendations for preventing the namelessness. The virus caused by COVID-19 has been named Coronnaire 2 (SARS-COV-2) symptoms of severe respiratory disease.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 Virus" and "COVID-19 Responsible Virus" in public letters and books
Sickness and illness are commonly referred to as "Cournaine Iris".
Wahan, during the initial outbreak of the plague in China, was commonly referred to as the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "Wahan Virus".
In January 2020, according to WHO's 2015 guidance against using the name of the place in the name of the disease and virus, WHO proposed nCOV-2019 and nCOV-2019 as the transitory name of the virus and the disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 continued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the sophisticated limitations of the Standard Splice Chances, some digital manufacturers are printing medical devices such as wired wires and ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed fans, and the seller did not provide them at the time, a local handicraft prepared a copy of it and made 100 people at night.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, the disease began, the duration, prevention, treatment and other early ideas, misinformation and misconceptions spread over the Internet.
Humans can spread viruses in some other animals
The study failed to find the testimony of Wirel Nashonma in the Sura, Tsars, and Birds.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
Public organizations, educational groups and industry researchers are conducting research on COVID-19 vaccines and medications.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Excellent Experiences" to examine the effects of the current anti-viral pathways.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively preparing vaccine expectations
The latter research on SARS-COV is being used because both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are using the same method to enter the ACE2 human cover.
The three wise volunteers for vaccination are currently under investigation.
First, the aim of the researchers is to prepare a vaccine for the whole virus.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, will provide immediate anti-COVID-19 against new diseases in the human body.
Another practical wisdom, the underlying vaccine, aimed at developing a vaccine that makes the virus sensitive to some of the underlying components of the immune system.
In the form of SARS-COV-2, the center of such research is the SPICK protein, which helps the virus enter the enzyme entry of ACE2.
Third wisdom is the method of preparing the vaccine.
The experience with these wise practitioners will be examined for the protection and effectiveness of the vaccine – the first medical test of the vaccine started on 16 March 2020 on four volunteers in the plant.
The vaccine is contained in the genetic code that was transferred from the virus that causes the disease for SARS-COV-2, and the anti-body-dependent vaccine preparation was potentially a challenge, but this is a warning.
Abi by April 2020, more than 300 active medical trials are ongoing
Seven studies have examined the drug that has already been prescribed for malaria, including four studies of Hydra-Axe Chlorquine or Chlorquine.
Most of China's research is based on a redesigned antiviral drug, reports of nine Phase III experiments on remise in several countries by the end of April.
By April 2020, the preparation and use of the COVID-19 vaccines had been subject to a movement test for hopes. For the treatment of COVID-19, a number of present antiviral drugs have been tested, including rheumatoids, chlorine and hydroxy chloride, lupinavir/ritonavir and lupinavir/ritonavir, which have been developed together with interferon BT.
By April 2020, there are temporary witnesses to the disaster from Remedieswier.
Medical improvement has been observed in patients treated with less radiation.
In the United States, China and Italy, the medical experience of Phase III is ongoing, with the initial results of a study on cloricin, which was used to treat malaria in February 2020.
Yes, we're holding voices to investigate the research.
Korea's and China's Medical Administration proposed the use of cloricin.
However, Wawan Institute of Tate for Wirelogy, although recommending a gram of daily food, recalls that the double dose can be extremely dangerous and dangerous.
On March 28, 2020, FD issued a letter of formal permission for doctors who are involved in treatment of patients with COVID-19, using their mild prohydrochloronic and chloroquin. Interferon, ribavirin or amifinavir are among the drugs used against COVID-19 in the 7th edition of this China Guide.
Initial data show that more than one planet is needed to prevent SARS-COV-2 in animals.
Nateaxanid has been advised after demonstrating low activity in the arrest of SARS-COV-2 for the use of voice studies. Information has shown that first-time recruitment is necessary to enter the SARS-COV-2 through TMPRSS2 for access to the first-time recruitment.
Chloroquine and hydroxial chloroquine have been severely prevented from taking this medicine without or without it, and are not prevented from taking it without further medical examination. The under-named SARS-COV-2 does not prevent it and is not known for its treatment of OVID-19.
In the wake of severe COVID-19, the cytokine stream may be a compaction
It has been observed that the hydroxial chlorine anti-situation is characterized by the stream, which has been included in the National Health Commission of China's medical instructions after a short study.
After positive results have been found in severely ill people, step 2 tests at national level in Italy are being carried out.
Associated with Sharm Feriton blood test kit to identify the stream, its purpose is to combat such progress, which some affected people consider to be cause of death
In 2017, the steroid refrigerator for the treatment of cytokine relieve disease, which was approved for a different reason, C RT cell therapy, on the basis of a previous study based on the FDD, Masantrlickin 6 receptors.
So far, there is no unintended, unintended evidence that Tsilicomab has a major treatment against CRS.
COVID-19 is a clear and focused anti-Badze, which is prepared by the anti-infectious system of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, but is being investigated as a non-active protective strain of a non-active vaccine.
This wisdom was tested with unending results for operational SARS.
Wire Neutralization is an expected way to prevent inactive anti-body therapy from SARS-COV-2
But other ways, such as the anti-body-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or Phoscytosus, can be possible.
Other forms of inactive antibody therapy, such as the use of a combined monoclonal antibody, are being used.
The progenitor of a healthy female cancer, which is part of the blood supply of healthy patients and which includes specific ante-buddies of this virus, can be prepared to be used quickly.
Coronnaire’s Diseases, Closely Associated Syndromes
Whohan's central hospital, a doctor, Lewin Lang, was impressed by the awareness of the spread of the virus and died because of COVID-19.
