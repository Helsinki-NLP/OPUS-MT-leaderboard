The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they are being taken by the Monscrets.
Contrection between some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, on the suggestion that they should change the name by MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate took place on plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be object of ridicule.
A member of the Laborist Party said his group was concerned that the new name "rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "foo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the set of "I wasn't content" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the change of name, but he stressed that MWP to Muppet had only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh was pronounced in a similar way to the English word in Yorkshire from the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, declared: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals, which showed great support for the name of the Wales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred Members of the Gales Parliament or WMP, but MWP's option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the operation of the assembly, such as the rules for disablement of the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians welcome the referendums to change the country's name
Voters will vote Sunday if their country's name is changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposes its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the defenders of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep silence while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church in each corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, not one thing or the other."
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which people usually go."
As for the churches, I'm afraid the money for the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll come back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of owners of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th street stores, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted the recruitment and promotion of black people.
A 1939 fire left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's frescoes made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the carriage as "the camps of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng at the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one occupied his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin in recent months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ that governs the parish and that is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "is going to impact the costs" together, although it did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some fries complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hits a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of langostas in California on the first day of the season of that crusade.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with screams, when he swam with a group of people to help get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an emotion to fish a lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting "I was working!
They hired me!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
"I'll drink to everyone who comes out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transferred on a helicopter to the Soviet Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
We don't know the kind of shark that's responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that they divided a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablanca, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the large warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable divestment in the UK's beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and home products fall, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 tents throughout the country, and will then pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the stations that occupied televisions, microwaves and household products on their day.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its supply of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current collections of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those that can be seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that institutions will increasingly look like shopping centers, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with discounts like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of tents, as he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernize its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but partnership came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute the pharmacies' incomes to their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sells his pharmaceutical business formed by 281 tents in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty runners to improve the surroundings for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from business of 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, went "urgent" after the TV shower Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his homewear brand and True accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, Gwynet Paltrow's brand.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing chips away from his life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "hot" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new businesses, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to dedicate to the homewear brand and accessories of both, True.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwynet Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that he would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, went to Instagram to announce that he had left True, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation residences.
One source said, "Truly was different one of Holly's priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the people who were involved in the project with them.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation's abandonment is among Britain's most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products that go from kitchens and candles to clothing and textiles to home, and that it could even delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV I'm to Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said last night, "We shouldn't comment on your business."
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He was playing with the criticisms he received by the media for making a comment that some would consider "no one's own" and for being so positive about the Norwegian leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting on his voice as a "tele newspaper presenter."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearization have stopped.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North does not see the "response" by the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his speech.
"The things with North Korea go well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: to end the tests with missiles, to help free hostages and to bring home the remaining US soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing out to the crowd he had just ahead.
An earthquake and tsunami destroy an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they left it very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, assured us that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that constantly sustain Indonesia, the country is extremely ill prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on the other side.
Although a warning was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's damaged infrastructure, producing money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds in the final line to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontations on the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of the pampate in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea gate with his team losing 1-0.
He played the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second suit.
The balloon flew over the area as it moved toward the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped into the air and entered the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to Kante and they gave me a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in minute 25.
The Blue front passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before it turned close to the middle of the change and entered the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful passage deep leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second pole marking a shot with the zurda that Alison Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool confronts Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the stadium of San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own thing with Videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped between the debris of the buildings that came down with a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho indicated in a press release.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with trash from destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman died in a car accident
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds on John Street, and was arrested by a 32-year-old suspect of murder.
The police asked people in the area to see or hear something of that one step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is in its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call to get in touch with us anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I'd also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to catch anything with the command panel camera who's in touch with us, because they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police officer confirmed that the found body belonged to a neighbor of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that they wouldn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to reenter within a few hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman on stage crying.
I don't stop saying, "It's horrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another right outside.
Several officials remain inside the cordon watching the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or who anonymously contacts Crimestoppers on the phone number 0800 555 111, quoting the 247 of September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewrite history"
Their ban would be poetic justification for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by their fanatical and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and to "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure located outside the Palace of Westminster became an objective.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they had sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary defender in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a full representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the divide.
Your achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig sneezes a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a Southwest China market.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the name, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered with blood close to a cut in the Liapanshu market in the province of Guizhou.
A fat pig prepares to place the vaccines on pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, province of Qinghai, China.
Apparently she traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave the other adjacent cut.
He said there was a big man with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and sneezing," said the cousin, called "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to let him eat his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the stage.
It seems that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they are not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, an almost 300-pound pig hit a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a pig farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs don't usually be aggressive, but that the blood taste can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that the pink hurricane weakens as it crosses the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds exceeding 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and to move east, towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to push tropical humidity to the north, which will penetrate the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring over 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, floods of garbage and the possibility of land discharges in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest there is hope of 50 to 100 l/m2 rain, especially on a large part of Arizona.
Possible sudden floods with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
We strongly recommend adventure in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms would bring locally torn winds and dust.
The valley will bring strong local rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause the flow of small debris and svardish roads.
These would be the first rains from the wet station in the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and the first of Monday, before the rain extends to the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes implies significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the south-east plains to the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last Friday hour: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, to get the FBI to conduct an investigation of a week's office.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made his toys drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other chains that forwarded it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have problems measuring people watching TV from offices.
To make an idea, it's a similar audience to a football final or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being hit by protesters when he was trying to enter an elevator at the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with the low-view for several minutes while he was being reconfigured, live TVed at the CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator closed, added that he would have more than to say in the committee's hearing.
All television and cable channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said he'd only do that if the FBI was investigating the allegations against the nominee next week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused anyone of criticising his plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to prejudice national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called Chequers plan from May to Brexit saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs from the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU, Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
The officers posted the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims would lose the glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the screenglasses and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to the affiliated CBS channel, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he had a $350,000 deposit imposed on him.
The Forensics Office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the State Police Flight Unit of Louisiana, at the state police crime lab, the South University police are to the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva thanked the local command forces for their "difficulty and search for justice".
Yes, I was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played the ballad for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 turns.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "defeated" and "smoothed" by the death of Wayde.
"That's what we care about all the time," said Wade.
Volcano Drops Gray on Mexico City
The ashes that throw the Volcano Popocatepetl came to the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to leave the volcano on Saturday after they detected activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of shocks and tremors.
The images of the social networks showed fine layers of gray in the suburbs of Mexico City neighborhoods like Joachimilco.
Geophysicals have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres south-west of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Meeting between the police and Catalan separatists before the independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors pro-independence faced the anti-disturb police and while thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by the police anti-disturbing guns and paints that created dark dust clouds in the streets that are often haunted by tourists.
There was also refrigeration later that same day with the police, who used the dicks to contain the lyorta.
For several hours, pro-independent groups that co-operated on "Do Not Forget or Forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long live to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues to flourish in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted hard for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The independent groups camped all Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but they were forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to his wife's independent demonstration, said that he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote, but now we're stuck," he commented.
Despite obtaining an adjusted victory, although decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan independent parties fought to keep the momentum, with many of their most known leaders in a self-imposed exile or detained in waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with her cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament in elections.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: They arrest a man after a car crashing against a house
Three 33, 34 and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (Summer Time in Britain).
Police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings has declared the fence and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It's also possible a beast was shot against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston the victory 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The uplifted Livingston surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second victory in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to get Gary Holt's team to go up one level after the hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, who separates them eight points.
But sooner the Rangers will get to Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
However, Livingston continues to be invited into the division by the sixth consecutive party; the main coach, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston lets out opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to move forward a long time before they scored, because with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross-shoot did not cross the threshold of the gate; then the shot of Alan Lithgow went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put the visitors at risk in the standby ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a bag where Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who played the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, Rangers dominated the property, but he met with an impenetrable defense that avoided much work to guard Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Ranger's guard, Allan McGregor, caught a shot of Scott Pittman with his weight, and Lithgow sent the ball out of another play at Livingston's stop ball.
There were many cross-steps in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two Penalti petitions were rejected: one by hand and the other by Halkett's entrance to replacement Glenn Middleton.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
"And unanimous, they were excellent and still surpassing expectations in their ascending path.
Their game style and players have only changed since they returned to the maximum category, but part of the merit is Holt's way you pushed the team since their arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, ruled a perfectly organized defense in a proud way while Menga gave them no breath all over the party to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers missed inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's order, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to hack into the host team once. A full call for Rangers, which is found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous greeting in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO allies.
They discussed many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then directed the Colony to launch a giant new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to avoid a crowd of 25,000 meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurdish) also raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the decision of the German receiving government in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision in which a car came around in London.
The accident took place near the crossroads between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street passing from Deptford, in the south-west of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (Summer schedule in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died in an accident with a leak in Children Street just over a mile and a half of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and the drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers are injured in disturbances
Six prison officials were injured in a high-security detention facility, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at Workestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 09:30 (Summer Time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officials received attention for minor facial injuries.
A prison official said: "The prison personnel were specially trained to deal with a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between riots."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disturb officers had to go to jail to calm down a revolt in which the staff was attacked with ball balls.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa storm passes through the South West Desert leaving the possibility of sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alerts of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesdays from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the southwest of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will walk directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service reported in a Twitter publication that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-kilometre Phoenix radio since 1950.
Katrina Hurricane (1967) was a hurricane that spread on a 64-kilometre radio from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service include 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with quantities isolated from up to 150l/m2 on the Mogollón border in Arizona.
Other areas of the South West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Grand Conca could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible total isolation of 100 l/m2.
For those who were in danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, for the region is very affected by the droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dryness, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, the Rosa Hurricane will land on the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane in the morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north to 19 km per hour.
The storm is meeting with cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is hoped that I will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or the night of Monday.
It could rain very much in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important flood risk.
"Total precipitation is expected from between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and can be found with up to 250 l/m2", weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as tropical depression and then will continue to climb up through Arizona and enter the South of Utah the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of her is the strong precipitation in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the South-West Desert of the United States," the U.S. National Centre of Furacans reported.
It is hoped that these rains could cause sudden water drums and waste streams in the deserts, and land discharges in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys 17, 18 and 20 were arrested during the night in the Radstock area respectively.
The officers asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the cell phone of the event.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh 'suffered the wickedness and cholera' of the Democratic Party
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the defiant and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump to a myth in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the wickedness and cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she sexually assaulted her decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial about his charge.
The president said on Saturday that that day the "US" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an impotent public service history," he said, addressing the crowd of West Virginia admirers.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican results in the mid-term elections.
"It takes five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't care, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "oppose and hinder".
It is expected that the first parliamentary vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place before Friday, according to CNN an assistant of the Republican Party.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have caused hundreds of deaths, and the number continues to grow.
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the village of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground, taking the lives of many and destroying everything to their feet.
Tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesia BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency in a prison round in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, dragged everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami would travel high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photos broadcast by the national disaster management agency showed a lot of damaged tents and buildings, torn and broken bridges and a watered mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantifying" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels would come down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Dongala and which is closer to the epicenter of the seismic.
The communications were "totally paralyzed and no information" by Donghala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said Cruz Redella in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not informing about the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared amateur on social networks, you can hear a man standing on the back of a building shouting out loud warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water shocks against the edge by taking forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate immediately for writing.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an important closure that led to the cut-off of communications throughout Palau, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuations continue to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami victim balance exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff traveled to get to the city of Palu, where the employees rest in shelters of lona raised in the yard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Dosseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of ongoing assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Paul from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff from abroad can only fluctuate if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster,' we can open up to international help, but that time has not yet come.'
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the missing caught up in the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that alleviated the depressing argument of natural disasters."
They took a kid out of a sink on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the trash for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliding paragliding for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel between the parapentist community, he had desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only a gray mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Stealing $26,750 while reloading a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
In the press release, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had empty a boxer in the leisure complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a purse of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police didn't realize how involved they were in the incident.
If you have any information on your identities, contact the Newport police calling number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West renames by Ye
Rape Kanye West changes the name for Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The former known as Kanye West."
It's been a while since West, 41 years old, is known as Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
It will replace the artist Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled her assistance for "emotional reasons," according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," he said that same year West while he was talking about his record with Big Boy's radio player.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only, only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that exists in us, of evil, of confusion, of all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, even though this year he announced that he prefers to call Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also caught up by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed himself to refraining from using military force against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square that "I would not use the military again to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were rooted in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys into criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in the United States.
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, ex-Employed by Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S.A. should double the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even though the U.S. lacks a formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicateing the research budget in IA would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next great advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicateing funding could double the odds that the next IA achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the American Othello player with a higher score and was later executive in Microsoft Research at the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions like the Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency and asked when it would be the next time to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers usually have to work a lot to get government bags, says Lee.
"China is not who is taking the academic leaders, but the companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university geniuses to work in IA.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include partners from industry and university, and the White House announced the formation of the select Committee of artificial information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, you currently invest over $100 million a year in research in IA.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that was trying to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not been registering movement for months.
The Macedonians vote in the referendum if the country's name is changed.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and that would block applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the referendum paper was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?"
The name change advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have voted for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they would achieve the result of the vote and make it final.
Change of nine would require a majority of two thirds of parliament.
The State Elections Committee has stated that no irregularities were recorded at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters filed their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko filed their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumika, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted for whom they boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our head high and not through the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO accession will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev commented after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, the figure below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people interviewed planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said I'd vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first important blow to the policy of the Western government since it came to power in May of the past.
View: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire Brighton defense and ends up scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took note of Brighton's defense with the Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to mark the goal of the 65th minute.
The first Argentine received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He set himself up for a defense before crossing several more on Brighton's border.
Next, he crossed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to give the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard with a shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero is going through some trouble at the foot," said the city's coach, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's where it happened.
We were lucky to mark it at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the face of the Premier League.
That goal arrived in minute 29.
Aguero got the ball in the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the gap on the right to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several hits before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The blue men put the ball in the gate before they left the camp.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherser wants to cheer up the Rockies party
With the Nationals outside the struggle for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a ever-competitive Scherzer expects to launch a Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still any involvement in the elimination of the Rockies, which brings an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one position of the cardinal with the victory 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to close their first division title.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play the tire knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opening will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to Scherzer whatever it is that launches in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom would be his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 entries this time.
Trump celebrates a myth in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while referring to the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't really do it, but I do, and that's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've already come to this horrible radical group of democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to recover power by any means necessary, evil, and wickedness.
They don't care who hurt them, over whom they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to them."
The democratic mission is to oppose and hinder."
"And they've seen it for the past four days," he said, qualifying the democrats for "fighting, screaming, naughty and lying."
He listed the Senate Judicial Committee, quoting Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong public support.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm.. come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members that we are not well received, and everything to say to our opinion.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she faced anti-Semitism decisions.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, random issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The notification to the working party in Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years I have been an employee, the committee's Friday night meetings have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, that's no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and it is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when partners with whom he was creating a similar political vision began to expect me to retire and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak in public, and in fact something like what I say, there is a tremendous abortion and attacks on the social networks censoring the central policy, telling me that it shouldn't be in the Laborist party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my companions, because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of the partners who face a torrent of racist or sexist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every movement of "untrustable" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes closer to the eyes.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head shut, not to be so frank, and then "it's going to be okay for me."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 still in school, led by the neglect of thatcher's government that literally let my class fall, I have tried to demand better public services for those most in need, both as local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in my last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political position and I do not agree with the party's current direction.
Those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would tell you is that while the country is on its way to a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party's leader.
But actually, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no political threat or convenience will deter me from acting in accordance with what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Inquisitor Ayr takes the lead
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to win this fine match from the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they're leading the table and it's the only invert team of ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk-taking fact, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we have been tested in our party and we continue to be invited, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You have to admit that Air has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put ahead of Air, but a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who surrendered to the Warriors' party, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climate increased the advantage for Air with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, it turned a single shot, leaving the mark 17-5 for Air in favor of rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who left the field in the pavilion and, from the beginning, Air advanced further through a Stafford McDowall test, transformed by the climate.
The captain in functions of Air, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took off from having a player more with Bruce Colvine's not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card to placate the Climus when he didn't have the ball, McPjerson scored a test from the penalty line at the back of Air's maul.
Climate marked, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth test of the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
The Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-protagonizes with his old partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next nine years will be the final, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "proper restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivia expects the court to take the way to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a shipyard covered with equipment in La Paz.
Public buildings run a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are nestled in the slogan: "The sea is our right.
To recover it is a duty."
In Bolivia without the sea, the memory of a lost coast in Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict continues alive, as well as the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits a positive detachment," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX judgment on giant screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will speak in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot in play in Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the reason, and that it would not change much if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to administer Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we've heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert on international law, Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could have been late.
"The topic of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate declares.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile's good will, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have been carrying ambassadors without exchange since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court was making an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open up a new phase of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements."
He also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong says his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is made at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "a utopia" that the United States' continued sanctions and objections to a statement that ends the Korean War can bend north.
In Washington, you resist accepting the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is the generalised skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pumpeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, don't look any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers revealed in the passage a series of extravagance accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that admired the public with the purest style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most surprising creations to the passageway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated hat adorned with a wide abbe, imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories were sands thrown, a magic hat and even a pine tree, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the tall sewing.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melted ice cone.
And if it's a giant fashion fan, it's lucky.
The fashionable people predicted that the giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bomb, the ball hat with a 60-centimeter abbot that takes everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought out another great creation: a beach bag almost as large as the model worn with a bath suit that carries it.
The orange rafia bag decorated with rafia flocks and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight piece of the Spring 2019 collection by Jacques' La Riviera in the fashion week of Paris.
The famous Luke Armitage stylist said to FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and large beach bags will arrive at the tents next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community matters.
With over 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English stamps), strive to offer the best level to students and so on by their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, their career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made study plan, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it gets to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, he will reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that languages are at the highest level in the board and at the highest approval rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an outstanding.
The data, compiled from 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained a mandarin honorary record, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding record.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages have the same considerations as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programmes.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why employers are costing them their vacancies.
Thus, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more working possibilities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case a 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for kids today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interests of their children are, private schools always have a number of languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the necessary skills to triumph, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is the head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron begins with Lakers or Sundays in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the sailors who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach, Like Walton, announced James will play the first anti-Denver Nuggets anti-Denver Nuggets match in San Diego.
But it's still up to you to decide how many minutes you'll play.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, they asked James for his plans to advance six Lakers' games.
At this point in my career I don't need pre-emption games to be ready," he said.
Trump's election acts come to Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign myths tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of the five myths programmed by Trump next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation on suspension for his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks support for the next half-term elections, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's myth in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
The Trump myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's myth in West Virginia to follow through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the subject of this week's trial with the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become stressed by the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and who is holding the Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of myths is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five myths that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dynamizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season," said Reuters a campaign speaker from Trump who preferred not to be appointed.
The middle of the night, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep the hope alive until individual Sunday matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon forum could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the impulse is now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I suppose we'll take that as a little push," said Jordan Speeth as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four more points of advantage at stake.
The Americans, said Spieth, feel they have a little wind in their favor and much to encourage, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and is preaching with example.
Those gutural screams were made stronger as he moved forward his round, making a crucial putt to patter the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the putt that made them win the game at 15, he threw a similar scream, the type of scream that says he thinks the U.S. team isn't out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," said Spieth.
It's the only thing left for these players now.
18 holes to get stuck.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beating on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to win a victory when you put the sun on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole that they had never been near to leave.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between the couples, the advice given, the ones not and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage the last day, but this foursomes session has also shown that the US Team has the strength to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to climb four points to the marker in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who sought to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a U.S. team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursoms, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the edge.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points followed, while Molinari and Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they fit into perfection to defeat a depleted Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4 more categorical.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without a penalty or glory, showed occasional brilliance cracks, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and five follow-up.
Justin Rose, who rested at the fourballs in the morning, met with his partner Henrik Stenson at the foursomes, winning a victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe couldn't always win on a nice day of breeze in southwest Paris.
Three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference point for the Americans, reaching two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 at the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team goes up four points in the individual, although as the current trophy owner, Furyk's team only needs to stick it up to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North color says no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had increased their mistrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho informed the Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming nuclear testing camps and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see the corresponding answer by the United States," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first."
While Ri was recuperating the well-known Norwegian complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as he took action, his statement seemed important, since he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long been searching for a formal ending to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive force, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can make us face is an impossible dream for anyone who doesn't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "bad president" Trump called Kim "man shoot you on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, which last year threatened with "complete destruction" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said there was no time for it, and that "it takes two years, three or five months at the same time."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the United Nations Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey's already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, only a few hours before North Korea complained to him about making mafia requests.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He noted that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing Washington relations.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growing masquerade culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Women's Women's, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
'At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why are they just telling me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," The Telegraph commented.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee boxes, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine when you sleep.
In another section, inform participants how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, we pour out brains, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think you have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending all night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students who had a lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep well enough and that you have a good quality sleep must be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. Even avoid fattering, because lack of sleep makes the brain enter in an inanimate way, which makes you starve constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler draw the course, after attending one of his classes last year's first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to sleep, as well as to wake up. Similarly, it is advisable to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emits electronic displays and LED lighting, which can disbalance the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 victory in Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first victory at home from the 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which he left to his team at eight points of the Hearts, leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before the break and a little inspirational Ranger alignment never gave the feeling that it was getting stuck.
While the Rangers went down to sixth place, Livingston went up to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a different goal.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the judge of the Calum Spence line had to have treated for a head wound after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Air into the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston who drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way that his set-up suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the balloon.
They could have marked in just two minutes when the short passage of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to the doorway of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second suit.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that he and Steven Lawless had to have asked for a penalti at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, only had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in 34 minutes might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the rest by changing the Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the hole made a pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow got his head up from the corn.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, called for another penalty when he was dating Jacobs, but Thomson made the fat look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning lunch: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counted... it was the day that the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A science pillar since then, Count Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film "The Campas de Coronado", starring those apparently isolated vampire scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these ears, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure you're stealing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognise defective cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and inject it again
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. Bethesda National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of patients' immune cells and "instructions" to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after its appearance in the Saturday Night Live (SNL) program.
And the result wasn't good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they joined Kanye West in the study after a confusing presentation in which he praised the US president, Donald Trump, and said he would present himself as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire led by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been broadcast, Chris Rock has taken pictures of Western criticism to social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to joke about West with this publication.
In addition, West complained at the hearing that he had had had a bad time in the builders because of his hat.
"They happened to me in the builders.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going to the pizza," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to get my pick?" saying, "I'm going to use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try it with love."
His comments led to applause in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed to be ashamed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the study remained absolutely silent."
They had appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexed with an interpretation of song I love it ("I Love"), dressed like a bottle of water Perrier.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits:
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful".
"So and so, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "the officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for stabbing at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Justice of Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic malehood
Kit Harington is known for his sword handling role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the Co-Protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt quite "strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel quite strong at this moment, when are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how did we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any Prequela or Secula of Game of Thrones when the series comes to its end next summer, affirming that "a lot of horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will stage a true West replacement by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he felt that his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this program, so, in a way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here on out," she said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, into Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been substantially reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the interim, the number of people living with HIV or with AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people was extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member filters data from the senators of the Republican Party, "dangerous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
On Saturday, the representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the United States Republican Party on the reader's Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereita".
"False lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters commented on a statement on Twitter.
It is noted that the information disseminated included the particular addresses and phone numbers of the senators of the United States of America, Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible for any way of filtration of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately aroused online criticism, including those of the former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This lying man has become angry," wrote Fleischer.
"You understand that you have no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get mad.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accused's motives.
It must remain acceptable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the Waters' reaction to the criticism of Justice Kavanaugh's democrats, to whom the critics accused him of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to decompose Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strong if it was true," he said on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will ensure that the guilty are found," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the parody of spying without the power of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of this parody and comedy of action by Johnny English, who started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will saturate ironic become about the apparently stupid issue that we are on the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent character of Johnny English's eyeballs and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic created for non-anglophone cinematographic territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his grotesque claims of adulation glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that contributed with a single note on the subject of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted into the now forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, in which he was sowing chaos at his own pace.
There's a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval suit of armor and the rotor's steps make a short crack against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious," such as 007 and Impossible Mission, they already use comedy in a convincing way as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed to children, instead of adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant adventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's movie jokes when he incarnates Bean's character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates the British supersecret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for distress of the service agent, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination of a prime minister who is in conflict, who is already in a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors know that, as all spies have committed themselves, they have to get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their old and suffering fellow Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the errors of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of succumbing to the charm of the multi-millionaire technological charismatic that he claims he can solve British computer problems: the leftist Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their hate of ridiculous fakes: dressed in chamberlains, catch fire at an ostentatious French restaurant; create a riot that illegally takes them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use some helmets of virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of the Volta house.
Obviously, all the arrests come out of that last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems taken out of a children's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent right?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but it covers five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but it will cover five.
Supposedly, the party wants entrepreneurs to spend their savings through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would "adjust" the party's economic agenda and its plans to bend the country to the benefit of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day shifts per week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Laborist Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy for the worker, as well as to the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition as a whole.
A spokesperson from the Laborist Party said, "A four-day working week does not enter party policy and is not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shade, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also imply that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a labor government could carry out "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place employees in company councils and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies' shares to employees, which pay annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy count "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the Department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, during an interview, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" reporter asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round."
However, Graham's vote seems to be irrevocable.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know this: Brett rejected it round," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive star cartel that will act and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people come to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like that of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness of the real objective of the event of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizens at 12 years of age to achieve their goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a Jewish way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism," people who think they make the difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, promoting a set of different goals.
It claims that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion were already disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that so far guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executive company that committed itself to "help children develop to their maximum potential" with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national authorities and supporters of Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the history page," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulllman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favour of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to do a "block" to make Russia's energy exports more difficult, US Interior Secretary announced.
"If necessary," Washington may resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government is operating, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the way they did in Eastern Europe," he said, according to the report.
Moreover, according to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels," he commented, at the same time referring to Russia saying that "it has only one tactic" with a dependent hydrocarbon economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of Trump's administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" North Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into "chain" from Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline at $110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The attitude of the United States has reached Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German organization leader of the sector, the German Federation of Industries (BDI, for its German stamps), called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy to the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that he would carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency after mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," said The Hill.
"I will examine my candidacy to the presidency on November 6th."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "carrying this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it has been shown that most of Warren's voters themselves do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Centre and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported that candidacy.
The investigation has shown more support for the candidacy of former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent opposition.
Other prominent names of the Democrats regarding a possible candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it before January, informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in Donald Trump's mitin
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
Monday night, arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with what he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEPT and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning to," explained Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the audience.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans "become different, hardened, wondering if there is any reason why the militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of Wasilla's police department.
18 states and the District of Colombia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a judicial appeal in relation to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner's party to the Grace Sessions v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Union for Civil Liberties) presented in August did not reveal itself against federal policy.
He told her that her "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that the U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers from the states that support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that refuses the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims who were victims of domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her February baby in the evacuation center of Palu's devastated city.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, collecting their stolen belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated in the open air due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel's room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," said Harris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I listened to my wife asking for help and then only silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of abusing "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published an announcement of four pages in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of the US-China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to the Chinese Daily payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of entering the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6th, because China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections showed what the officials of that country had done in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to co-operate with China.
While it is normal that foreign governments publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war testify to the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, China's compensating tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters like Iowa, which supports the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and Governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and North American entrepreneurs.
In an article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China is "intensifying this campaign by broadcasting propaganda ads in the free U.S. press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a payment announcement at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, instead of newspapers located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he claims that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is a journal.
Kavanaugh's disaster causes women's Republican vote to be lost in a few days' term of office.
Although many of the main Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the forthcoming half-mandate elections.
The reactions around these charges were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University of Syracuse in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," thought Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman for the Progressist Group MoveOn, in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the "About November!" flu, appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, informed Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will surpass any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"Of course it's already high,
But it's going to be even more marked, especially among the indecisive polling women from the neighborhoods outside or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the papers."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former member of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week at the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the accused's bank or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the people surveyed believe ford's testimony is entirely or probably, compared to 35% that supports Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, in front of a 30% who thinks the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, informs The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of drunkenness when he was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when she studied in Yale in the '80s.
The Creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what information people can access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky that the intention of hiding Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has a complete control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as a "personal empowerment through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project and a volunteer programming community.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor with Google about entering or not a complete change that would modify their business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a solid-based new web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new web age," Berners-Lee added.
Honor Bernard Vann, priest decorated with the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Cross of Victoria during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was won on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was granted the greatest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were assigned to discover a memorial monument to his honour at a show in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's passion that deserved his title.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the play of an intense fire of meteors".
Later he hurried to get to the line of fire and, with a "great courage," directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no one's help, and to throw down three men of the enemy's retreat.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson still like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the show, which led the young Brentwood Imperial band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this Jewish hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut off the MMA fans' roll at the best time
Imagine you're taking all night awake to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when you get to the best part, something's stopping you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 fights, six mains, and was streaming live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were seeing the faces, the UK viewers were blinded when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these childish drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke."
"The state policy argues that this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and that is why he had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President of Marketing and Bellator Communication, when asked for the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would take into account UK spectators in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started to receive many messages and not all were nice.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise you won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited to the first program of Desert Island Radio Discs 4 led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low by illness.
As invited by Laverne's first program, Daley shared that she felt "less" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He even said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what moved me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was someone so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in Australia's Commonwealth games to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She decided to speak because she felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of impact, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three times champion of the world said to fall in love with the American performer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was all a surprise."
Daley married this winner of a Oscar last year and says that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so long" (with only 14 years of age he first took part in an Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son was entrances to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to deal with that first row," said Daley.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and was at that precise moment, at the time of her death, when I realized that it was really not invincible," she added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling."
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, because it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still puts his hair on his head.

A Mickelson in a low form ended up at Ryder Cup's bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his technique so that this doesn't turn out to be an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the 12th round event, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times for the United States, the five times the champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve their movements.
Although it was never the most accurate of players, not even at the height of their career, at their 48 years of age it does not fit into the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shoots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced on Sunday's ninth match to Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the U.S., four points below the start of the 12 individual games, start with a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, though he couldn't say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, gave me a palm on his shoulder, passed over my arm and told me he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"I fully trusted myself.
It has a prominent place in the Famous Hall and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but that's the way things are, and that's how we think they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
You could mark the end of your career at the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of your individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halfs, although Furyk claims his presence also provides the team with unmistakable.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, with a genius and he likes to interact with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good that the younger players have done to him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup individual can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
Grand Danes started in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesters had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but they ended up on the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brooklyn, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little," Bjorn, in the photo, said after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this has not yet been completed.
We have to go for everyone tomorrow.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This will not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you give the best proof of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to deliver to the players, who take the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
The difference between Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than with their companions, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
The Furyk himself was in about two extremes of these last-day rounds, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending as a loser after the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered, when asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered the players face-to-face the last day.
"We have 12 important games, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brooklyn or Medina.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in these middle games.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," explained Bjorn about his selection for the individual.
The new warship of Germany postponed once more
The latest Fragate of the German Army should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The post of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the baden-Wuerttemberg-class flammates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but subsequent delivery problems affected the destination of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Army commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class wrecks.
It is understood that they will count on a powerful cannon, with different anti-era missiles and anti-bulk missiles, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to spread the newest fractures up to two years outside the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be obsolete when they enter service.
The F125 Fragata disaster was reported last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons behind this return, but the German media were talking about "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors, that is, half of the personnel needed in the old Bremen class fractures.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the Rhineland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons weighs twice as much as the similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the project's total cost, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million is already reached, compared to the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest frogs are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy is being left without ships capable of deploying.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of the baden-Württemberg-class frogs could join the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the bites
A new research that is being carried out in a highlands area in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association, will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus bites, as well as the Myotis daubentonii bites and Plecotus auritus bites in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis carried out by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the bites and what each species is doing.
Then a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to mosquitoes and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and aluminators also pose a risk, as well as fly traps, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTSC, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes the bites very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, inspections of children and, at times, even rescues.
The organisation even has the only and first reserve of Scottish bites in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bites in Scotland.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Thrave we have a great area for bites," he said.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there's a lot of things we still don't know about bites, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of mosquitoes before performing maintenance tasks in the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single motherhood child could kill up to 400 women and children, which could wipe out a whole local population.
Mortgages are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, accuse or disturb them, as well as to destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about mosquitoes and, in the case of many species, we don't know how they're going to their populations."
Ronaldo disavows claims for rape and his lawyers prepare to claim German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know themselves using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, a US woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 so that he didn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, caught this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," said the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for just saying my name, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectful man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they qualify as "an inadmissible declaration of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly violated her annually, according to the documents presented in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying he was 99 % a knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations agreed upon by both parties.
Mayorga also argues that she came to the police and that she had photographs of the wounds, but later she came to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt afraid of reprisals and was concerned about the public scan.
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with the Royal Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he incorporated the Italian giant Juve into an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would abandon the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret the permanent loss of its position as the world car manufacturer's leader in Brexit, according to Greg Clark's business secretary.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say in the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaton plant, near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement," added Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing Auris and Avensis models in Toyota, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandons the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the sub-minister chain in case no agreement is reached in Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is very adjusted, every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU car suppliers arrive at the measure.
If on 29 March, the United Kingdom abandons the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and lack of parts could be generated.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace more than a day on the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid border checks."
"It's essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so to enjoy the current success, but also to make the most of this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent sub-minister chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, employed by Burnaston for 24 years and union coordinator of Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said they presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could get angry again.
The White House stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and Rosenstein's sub-secretary could be delayed one more week due to the fight by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fired the attached general prosecutor, as if he didn't, which would put Mueller's independence at risk, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President by amendment 25.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock at the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In front of the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There is not yet a fixed date; it could be this week or be delayed for another week, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists have questioned this claim, since Sanders has been taking it since September 10th without celebrating a press round.
When the presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of an information session was not due to a deviation from the reporter's large location, although he added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press should increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president said, even though he has not quoted any source that would evaluate this data.
They will continue to hold information meetings, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that's much better than asking questions to her.
You're witnessing how we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and that'll replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, private press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president has shown the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country while Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to covering the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach decisions this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of anxiety for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate the value of each member of staff contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows of the European Union and beyond, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Looks like he fainted when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him to bed to carry out a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville (Tennessee), that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old student in a red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised to 18 his total of the season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This additional money will be used to help people without home due to new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp tax shall apply to those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasure hopes to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the collected money will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second dwellings and the purchases for rent, may be up to 3 %.
Farma expects change to reach up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new buildings in London are sold by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a house for the first time have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in capital, have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy is applied just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to apply a cut in the tax on land transfer to help new people buy their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of the high houses through the purchase of land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on the moderately priced houses to settle the "golden housing sector" that lives in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of reform proposals in relation to housing, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of defamation in which the tenant is not guilty.
He also wants to grant councils greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs. May stated: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And to that end, it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is just as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based on foreigners, to buy homes than for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of a house is too far away, and the indignation that is supposed not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, has stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's electorate at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club in the northwest, which currently occupies the third square in League One, at three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last summer.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew up to play Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager said he didn't feel worried about these so-consolidated figures in such a large club after rejecting earlier proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and installations of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to arrive, but it's probably just that you think I've achieved success here if I can get the club back to the Premier."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period of assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the technical staff of the Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to be about to come down to win the title of the Championship next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crucillation," he recalled, about to take over the Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because I didn't feel bad, I made a reasonable profit in my life, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still suffering from stress and work pressure, but training likes it.
I've always enjoyed training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 (British summer time)
According to one survey, the perfect time to take a picture is 17:30 a.m.
Summer heat wave increased consumption in the British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA's trade advisory board, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the football world for longer time caused a pattern similar to that of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, even though restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of the restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
The food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, employed by RSM for analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to out-of-home consumption.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful if you add to it the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restoration business and the time will be the task of saying whether the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator from the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operational groups with total profits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector benchmark.
One in five children have secret social networks that hide their parents
One in five children (some just 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers from a survey
A survey conducted by 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children (some just 11 years of age) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (referring to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news caused an increase in the fear that sexual content would be published.
Twenty percent of the students claimed that they used a "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "violate."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It is alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the council of the Scottish Federation of Sports
Eilid Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Federation of Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most talented Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom and at the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a strong desire to make a spokesman for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympics and currently working as a usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered from apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and now I'm doing exercise of agility.
Thanks for the encouragement messages."
An announcement of a mother milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion into networks
A parent milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad that compares nursing mothers with cows that are mowing.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "first silent portable breast milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor.
Four real mothers dance in a bowl full of hay for cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like, "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't realize, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Muxe, muxe, I'm feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, I'm mowing my friends."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the viewers. Many of them claimed that it manifests the "horrors" of the milk sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly within a parental suction (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use it to announce a milk extractor for the mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added, "What I announce with so little tact."
Other spectators defended the ad, even one woman said the song seemed "very funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little shot, but I interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad directed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their jobs or in bathrooms) and feel like "vacas".
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk extractor is completely silent, he has no cables or tubes and he can discreetly fit into a mother's subjection, which gives women freedom to move, subject their babies and even get out there while they're taking out their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative executive director of Mother commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By describing the parallelism between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that entailed while demonstrating in a manner that was entertaining and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie extractor has taken over newspaper headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unvariable, partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to allocate teachers to the children.
Traditionally, most of the peasants were also homeless immigrants and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior in charge of the United States Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to take out minors without a company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are natives or who are part of their home are found illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in the courtroom before a month passed from their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through videoconference instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they stay under surveillance, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent kidnappings or attempted escape according to the refugee workers and system reports published over the past few months.
The lawyers have said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions than that of Tornillo, where there is more possibility that the symptoms of a child going through a bad time pass unnoticed because of its size.
They also added that moving the children to the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found in Syria alone illegally, with the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in an appropriate manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," she communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were met and he blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last great rebel battalion of Idlib allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear limit dates" and expressed his hope that military actions would be targeted by the jihadists, including Al-Nusra front soldiers who were linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The UN envoy of the Mixture Staff has the hope of convening the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
They put forward the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the agency should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and alerted to possible interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to re-elect in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to their presidency in a premature manner.
No doubt it would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, premium-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled to reach 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in premium-time, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show's program led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news came.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor", who is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, he asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment inside the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the patterns that appear in Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Still, suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fair", Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar avest coat ("a dress full of arrogance", said Washington Pos) and the implications of the broken description of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what it turns out to be a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with changes in characters and daily argumental movements of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to lose an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made sun and a temperature of 26 degrees out of the house, on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was locked up in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to get out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at that time and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The external money comes to many to fund the chamber's candidacy for the election of half the lecturer
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in career positions to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburgh which has recently been reorganized is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who reached his post in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is present against another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that Republicans would manipulate the electoral districts' electoral districts in favor of them.
The election career in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign funding festival between the parties' main financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee of Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after winning a match in the March special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed extensive follow-up.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political experts give democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing the Savior for his support for China and then put themselves back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even held a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization steering team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order to return to the heads of the US diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "by recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, department spokesman in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million during 2017, included to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was fought.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in the financial assistance and restrictions on visas, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent people from emigrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, important officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions to Salvador.
It is scheduled that Vice-President Mike Pence will head the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations whenever and when the participants' anonymity remained.
His accounts were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction to Mr Trump's justice, of which there is currently ample evidence in the public file.
It is noted that Mr. Mueller is also leading his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must report to that agency, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the western front resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent killings.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexhaustible progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several of these inflexible points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested to record secretly to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information of The Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the cruel allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the half-legislatorial elections for a Congress requiring responsibility for Mr Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who also occupied my house, who was aware of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans player is very optimistic about the encounter with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive pampering achieved in Spain in front of the Villareal this very month, would put them in a very favorable position to be classified in the Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented Central Camper Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 bump in front of the Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since the Villareal is a good team," declared the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the party believing that we could get something positive and get a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were higher.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard among all that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there is an excellent environment at this point.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women are worried about their savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear how they wanted to be looked after, few people talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they'd talk to their children about the subject.
"People want you to take care of a family, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
They can start next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't tell them your wishes in advance.
You work with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to get care, because these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the funding options for long-term care are a policy on long-term long-term long-term care, a life insurance policy that is hybrid in cash to help cover these expenses or self-security covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note that this information is in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors taking care of it?" asked Martin.

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, aged 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place about 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Their wounds are not serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to increase.
Because of the cut-off of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area located in the north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7.5 degrees in magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided you with some key data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regency located more than 300 km north-west of the island of Celebes.
This regiment, an administrative region less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Dongala have been affected several times by tsunamis over the last 100 years according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific fire belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck the south of Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees in magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude affected the Mentawai islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regiment, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami deaths of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died because of the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
They arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29-year-old Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of a domestic violence crime, preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and for resistance to authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed the phone.
Palin remains in preventive prison in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility units with a $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He was brought before the judge on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, since then" when asked, he informed the chain.
Palin faces three minor A crimes, which means he could go to prison for up to a year and get a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time you have criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and of possession of weapons in a state of emergency in relation to the incident.
His bride will accuse him of putting a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with post-straumatic stress disorder syndrome that suffers from serving with the army in Iraq.
A earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
At least 384 were killed after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and it is expected that the dead's balance will increase over the course of the days.
The earthquake occurred right in front of Central Celebes, northwest of the Indonesian capital, Iacarta.
Circulate videos through the associated networks where the impact time is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply the death penalty a few times to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike from the West Side Highway Avenue of Lower Manhattan, following the lives of the footmen and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intentionally" injuries, according to the notification of the intention to apply for a death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight crimes of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by the prosecutors of organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared when describing the way Saipov carried out the "trouble, cruel and devious" attack.
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci" as indicated in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South District of New York did not process a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being condemned by conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he displayed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
It was declared innocent of the charge of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with eternal chains without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved," Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team would have asked the prosecutors beforehand not to apply for the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the EU.
In front of the Birmingham demonstration, ordinary Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would have "already left" the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her party's divided ranks was evident when she joined the Tories favouring to remain in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between Brexit, the opposite and the EU supporters' attacks.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and their chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the concentration of the Solihull's Leave Means Movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that he should have consulted Mr Farage to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been appointed, we would have already been outside the EU at this time," he said.
Member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan'.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that indicated that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false".
Brexit's member, Andrea Jenkins, has also been on the march since he told reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity between the public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, first of all, occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a topic of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and we're here today to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of stay in the EU took a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
Several activists flocked to the Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) message after the group's launch this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept does not exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or introduce himself to the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd seriously think about his candidacy to the presidency after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about his future on Saturday during a municipal meeting in a locality west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that set it up as Trump's successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his voters using the council format since Trump took over the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that this is the time when "women are going to Washington to solve the problems of our government, and for this to happen a woman needs to be in the seat of the presidency".
A kill shot by Sims, the LSU player has been arrested
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old detention of Diteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (early east).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out of the pictures.
Yes, 20 years old, he was shot near the Southern University campus in the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head and finally died as a result of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and placed in custody in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Yes, a two-foot-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to the team orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas was ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who was leaving the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton just as he defended his position during the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxes first and left Hamilton in traffic in the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes a second time and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton followed him after several wheeled maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to leave behind badly gainfully the inside the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the output grid and went back to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he led the career during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get to the end faster and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally went into boxes around 44 but couldn't move any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real knight.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
A poorly-sorted body language
President Donald Trump scoffed at Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence on not filtering Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech given in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee and commented on what was happening in the Senate instead that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying".
"The only thing that could have happened and the most beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate in the last few days when you see anger, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
«When you see these publications and filters and they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you do any filtering?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the committee as reported in The Hill newspaper.
"We asked you to keep your privacy and do what you asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night's event: "I told you that corporal language was not the proper one.
It may not be filtered, but it used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual misconduct inadequate by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to recover power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repulsive, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to find to regain power and control," said the second Mediate president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday at the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants achieved an early advantage through two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie flocked to the local set before Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard pampered for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third victory in the Elite League of the Age for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to win the Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of three victories before the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was at 3:35 p.m. with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvilier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In a troubled initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the goal of the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance in the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard re-attached the game with a goal through power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the party at the end of the second period and secured victory through the fifth goal of their team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home at Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
A Indonesia air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely be disembarked.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday or Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people trapped under the shells of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu airport which was violently balanced.
He stayed at his post to make sure that Batik Air, which was on the exit track at the time, could safely be cleared.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirat said it is possible that this decision will allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"It breaks our hearts when we understand us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death rate may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Donganga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the shells and many of them could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting help and shelters.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
The drinking water is scarce.
People are picking up the minimers."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what will be found there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after a plane crash in a lake
The aircraft that operates a flight that starved into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after stating earlier that the 47 passengers and crew left the plane that was sinking without incident.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Zone ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continues to be unclear.
Both the plane and the U.S. Army confirmed that the plane landed in the lake before arriving on the landing track.
Some witnesses say the plane passed the landing trail.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little time.
"That's an extremely positive thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their belt to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight assistants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Army indicated that sailors working close to the scene in a pier's improvement tasks also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sinks about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one has affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composed the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors refer to the evidence Saturday to repeat the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to compensate the movements of the defendant of 29 years old, Quinton Tellis, and of the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones that demonstrated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous claims as reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up the road on Saturday and testified that that day wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that one time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"Borrow her of her life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defence will begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge declared that he expected the judge to be seen for judgment by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has drifted away from its sources with political messages and struggle against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the combative hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Refugees and Common have recently experienced a concert in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A New York Children's Guardian asks for a couple after a "racist" message
A New York guardian of children is going to claim a couple for being discriminated against after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares demand with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, showed her anguish by discovering that the guardian of children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NGERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "convenient" Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the guardian who had just gone, who was an African-American, had done his job wrong and who was expecting a Filipino according to New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid the day she worked and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to ask the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and requires a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of domestic work for which she was initially hired even though there was no contract on average.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done," he told Post on Friday, to add "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that to fire Maurice was the most reasonable, for they were afraid they could not trust her after insulting her.
"My wife would send him a message he didn't intend to send.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they were offended, even though it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are they going for someone like that?
That's not very ethical," the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them by their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as it might end in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented about the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
After claiming that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a little toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that if his work was rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aridous" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think he felt Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was a creation of his imagination and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and had to say goodbye through the phone
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nothing regularly called to say it was very bad, which was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
She had died a while before and was now turning off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at that moment of battle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the calvary she was suffering.
"No one's detected it," he said.
"I had my head down and my tears fell all the time.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posters of troubled women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are taking cards on a galley bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any room."
However, he quit his job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm still concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't keep your mouth shut, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"You didn't tell me you were sad or depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in your attitude.
Christmas Day hit the bottom (when the children opened their traps, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must surpass him: "He destroyed the family.
He's been calling us off.
But we have to keep moving forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread while the FBI launches the investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what we were asking for (a limited period of research and limited scope), maybe we could get some unity," Mr. Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "depleting" due to the paralysis of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Your delay is due to a matter of time.
If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI carries out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently employ 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea is below Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, stated that 1,127 desertions will take place during the past year, away from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the rising rates charged by people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
It is only stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them went across China, which has the largest border line with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone existing between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them compulsorily.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continues in war) has improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which they agreed to work a great deal to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we don't trust in the United States, we can't trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and claims that it is not suitable to access the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and ensured that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman would ever behave like this, she would call it hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost shouting and staying talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats, cataloging the charges against him as a "sacrifice of grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection to the patient and the care of accessible health or the Roe v. Wade case, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the context of confirmation, Kavanaugh ignored questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and still above hope that we say, look at that well!" said Pelosi.
And women need to exercise it.
It's about a justifiable diabetes, months and years of anger overcoming, and you can't expel it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem commented 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted in that, when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then I went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my finest memories in one of my first works in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from behind the neck, a higher distance that always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the void of the stairs.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an affair outside of marriage in a ship called Monkey Business and was removed from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not be considered to be presented to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," I remarked 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the career and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the seven years."
Because the campaign was advanced, it took a long time to collect funds, so he swore he wouldn't be in the race for the presidency unless he could collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of the supporters contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported it, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates and anger for existing sexism) that remained speechless.
"You'd think she had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my stone?
"Do you hear?"
How trade between the United States and China can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were horrific and, despite the war being far from over, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning early this year recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was produced this week with new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming from the United States of China.
Pequín countered the same thing every time, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent to six billion dollars in U.S. products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to surrender to his demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the US trade war could have favored China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions needed to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than it was previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries that support the uprising.
Europe achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National Club located outside Paris, France.
It's the sixth consecutive U.S. victory in European territory and it's been running a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain's team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, which was the most battle he offered during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th pair hole, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was installed in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was defeated by a player with a worst-class European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, in Denmark.
The first world ranking man, Dustin Johnson, lost 2+1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups quarreled, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to recover the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods for 2-1 in the individual Sunday party.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up to play that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now he has a 13-21-3 record on Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, a 14-year-old winner, located just behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had problems all weekend so they wouldn't get out of the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf course throughout the tournament.
The captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I was proud of these boys, they fought.
This morning, for a moment, they put Europeans in difficulty.
We fought.
I'll take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior."
