Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) are concerned about the possibility of being "recognised as ermes"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament" (Parliament of Wales).
AM throughout the political spectrum is concerned that it can make them a funny object.
One of the Leborist Party AM explained that their group is concerned with "playing with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh "twp" means "single", but "pwp" means "cake".
The Plaid AM indicated that none of the group was "not satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of the Wales Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to examine the change of name, but added that "MWP" is very similar to "Muppet", which means "herm".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the word "w" is spoken similarly in the English language of the Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up to change the name of the draft legislation, informed: "The final decision on the terms to be used for the appointment of members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 conferred the right of the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposals and received broad support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name AM, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but MWP received the largest support in the public consultation.
AM clearly recommends alternative options, but the struggle for an agreement can lead to headaches for the Assembly Speaker Elina Jones (Elin Jones), who is expected to submit a bill of amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the assembly, including the laws on the structure of the AM disqualification and the committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will take place when they have discussed the legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in the referendum on the change of national name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country name will be changed to the "Nordic Republic of Macedonia".
The referendum was organised to resolve the long-standing dispute with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, for decades.
Athens has long argued that the northern neighbour's name has been an impression of claims on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gorge Ivanov (Gorge Ivanov), one of the plebiscite for the name change opponents, announced that by ignoring the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev (Zoran Zaev), object that the change of name is simply a matter to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls to the goddess are silent, and the churches of Harlem are fighting for existence.
"As the old people I've talked to before, there were at least a bar and a god," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there's not one anymore, not another."
He admits that the loss of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the gods, he is concerned that the money received by selling property will end sooner than expected leaders, "and sooner or later they will return at the beginning".
God, he added, may be replaced by multi-dwelling buildings with apartments that will be used by people who will not help the rest of the temples around them.
"Most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come when these gods will turn around forever, because it is unlikely that most people who enter these apartments will become members of these congregations."
Both the white congregation was formed before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolis (Metropolitan) community in 1870, and St. Martin’s, 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the buildings in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had served God nearby.
St. Martin’s Divine Black Congregation took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. He led the boycott of the working small merchants who had refused to take up work or grant them an increase in the 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem.
In 1939, the fire was seriously damaged, but since the members of his father’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call.
His blessing was David Johnson (David Johnson), his father's son Johnson and his successor in the St. Martin's congregation, with pride called the call game "the calls of the poor".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "Cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionysius A. Lind (Dionysius A. Lind), who moved 18 years ago to the larger call game in Riversaida church.
Mr. Merivezera (Merriweather) said that the congregation of St. Martin did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s goddess reflected the relationship between the fragmented architects and builders, some of whom had been employed by the secular authority, and others by the bishop’s diocese.
In July, the Council of the Congregation, which is made up of secular leaders, addressed the diocese in writing with the concern that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the council, although the council had not been involved in the settlement of diocese-sponsored architects and builders.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Sharks wound 13-year-olds in an oar fishing place
On Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California who sneezed after the lobsters and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services told.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the coastal city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel (Chad Hammel) informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had a kidney about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and then the group rushed to him to help the boy draw out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought that it was just a feeling about the damaged lobster, but then he "understanded that the boy was crying "I'm crying!
It's my fault!"
His whole neck of the key was torn apart," Hammels said, who noticed it right away when he got to the boy.
"I cry for everyone to leave the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammels added.
The boy was transferred by air to the Rady Children’s Hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of sharks that have been attacked is unknown.
In a brief briefing by Captain Larry Giles, the rescuer reported that a shark had been observed a few weeks earlier in this territory, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jails added that the victim was traumatized by the upper part of the rumpet.
For 48 hours, officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca (Casablad) to Swami (Swami's) Ensinitas (Encinitas).
Jules pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to impress the UK Beauty Industry Market
"Sainsbury's" takes place in the attack "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with a universal-style beauty treatment product for hair rows and trained sellers.
As part of a significant contribution to the UK's large beauty-care market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while the cost of fashion goods and household items will decrease, 11 shops in the UK will be tested by larger beauty-care products in turn, and, if all wheels are successful, there will be more such shop next year.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for the possibility of using hair that had previously been allocated to televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" reported that it would double its offers in the area of beauty handling up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybellline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more seats with brand areas similar to those in boats stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique decorative cosmetic line, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly required by younger customers in the years.
In addition, the fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try a concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, but the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to small food purchases in local shops every day means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's Executive Director Mike Coupe has said that trading venues will become more and more like universal stores, because the store chain is trying to fight discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed the Argos trading venues in several hundred shops and has opened several Habitats, since the purchase of both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the supplies and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to improve its beauty management and pharmaceutical departments ended with a collapse.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots tried in the early 2000s, but the Union came out after the dispute on how to share revenues from pharmaceutical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy is being developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds 3 years ago.
According to this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with supplementing the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hiks (Paul Mills-Hicks), Business Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve our customers' thinking environment, we have transformed the appearance of our beautifully crafted products and the impression they create.
We have also invested funds in highly trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment with a comfortable location means that we are now a hugging goal towards beauty, a goal that challenges the habits of today's purchase."
Peter Johns "full of pleasure" after Holly Willubia refuses 11 million pounds of business
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "takes over the niche" after Holly Willoughby, TV broadcast director Holly Willoughby, turned down 11 million pounds of business with his lifestyle brand to pay full attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilubia doesn't have time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to the "Truly" brand.
The pair business was compared to the Guinean Paltrow (Guyneth Paltrow) brand "Goop".
The 37-year-old broadcast manager used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Hollya Wiloubia has left the Dragon Den star Peter Jones in a frenzy, for the last time he left his profitable lifestyle brand business – to focus all his attention on his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The information sources claim that Jones was "full of fun" when a TV gold girl was busy at a meeting on Tuesday's business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that she no longer had time to dedicate her home clothes and accessories to the brand "Truly".
The company was compared to the Guinea Platrova brand Goop, and according to the house, it will double increase the Vilnius wealth, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Vilubia (37) used Instagram to announce that leaving "Truly", Jones moved away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truly" was the very main priority of Holly's priorities.
This was to become her long - term future, to which she would be dedicated in the coming decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlov there is a warehouse for full sale of ready goods."
Experts believe that these Morning leaders, who are one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions to the company, because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from sinks and candles, to clothing and household goods, and will be even more late to market them.
And it can mean a long end of friendship.
Three children’s mother, Wilubija, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close relations with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Vilubia "Truly" together with Keppa was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both of them spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in the company of the producers of Boldvina TV.
Willubia must become the M&S letter and she will replace Entu McPartlin (Ant McPartlin) as the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business business!"
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism received from news companies about a comment that some might consider "indecent to the President", and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is the president as much as he has refused?
Tramps said in his image in the voice of "the dictator."
"I don't care how!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Tramps recognized their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step against North Korea's denuclearisation.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the main North Korean diplomats Ri Yongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" to the original steps towards disarmament in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Tramps was much more optimistic in the speech of his mistress.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results — the cessation of missile testing, the release of the winners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach to dealing with Kim.
"It's just to make the president's impression, but instead of standing out there 10,000 people trying to enter this densely populated area, we have 200, here, here," said Trump, pointing out the effort right in front of him.
Cunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations abroad were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the people of Lomboka were displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a known problem," admitted Sumbung's (Sumbung) novelist.
Although "Save children" gathers groups to travel to Pala, it is still not clear whether foreign workers can work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that the Indonesian officials appreciated the situation of Palu in order to see whether the international agencies would be able to make their contribution.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely negative to natural beauty.
Although Aceh has been established in cases of shelter tsunami, these are rare on other shores.
Likely, the loss of people was also a result of Paul’s failure to heed the warning message about the tsunami, even though the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, who had arrived in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims, is now going to the Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the new victims of the postage.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) had made the improvement of Indonesia's damaged infrastructure the central point of his election campaign, and he has allocated a large amount to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has taught Mr. Joko’s administration, and he is awaiting a re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to face the long-standing problem of tension between the sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using cats, volleyballs, and other primitive weapons.
See: "Liverpool" player Daniels Stridjs with a wide range restores balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturidge rescued Liverpool from the loss against Chelsea by winning doors at the 89 minute Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge in London.
The rod received a play from the Jordan Shakiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate when his team lost at 1:0.
He moved the bomb a little to the left of himself and then pushed the bomb in the further direction of the gate pole.
In this attempt, the bomb flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the network.
At the end of the bomb, the head of Kepa Arizabalag (Kepa Arizabalag) was crossed and landed on the network.
"I was just trying to get their position to get to the bomb, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible," Starridge explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Kante (Kante) approaching, hit the bomb, and, without much thought, the sperm."
In Chelsea's half-life, she was in charge of 1:0 after the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard (Eden Hazard).
The Blues attacker played the bomb back to Mateo Kovacic (Mateo Kovacic), before turning to the middle of the field and moving as fast as possible to the side of the Liverpool field.
Kovacič played and received a bomb back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful match between the players, allowing Azar to enter the area.
Azard's speed of victory protected and finished the combination by making a seat on the further pole network, along with the "Liverpool" Elison Becker (Alison Becker).
"Liverpool" The Champions' Teams will fight "Napoli" in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea with Videoton UEFA will meet at London on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The number of victims in Indonesia reaches 832
Earthquakes and tsunamis have reached 832 people in Indonesia, the state disaster agency announced early Sunday.
Many people have been reported to have been simpled in buildings on the basis of a 7.5-magnitude large earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 high waves (~6.0 m) and reported by Sutopo Purwo Nugroho (Sutopo Nugroho) at the news conference.
In Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, the ruins of the fallen buildings were covered.
Police suspect of murder of a woman arrested by a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was initiated after this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside, found a female body.
At 7: 55 a.m., the 44 - year - old victim was found in Grayson Mews Street, John, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have called for people in this neighborhood who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan (Brian O'Hagan) reported: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite us to contact everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhed and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite every taxi driver, especially those who might have fixed something for his car in video recorders, to contact us, because they may have information important to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local resident of Birkenheda, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation will continue and, as the police have reported, they are working on informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Greison’s Museum tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not even say a word when he learned what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours to return.
He was hearing a cop tell a man that the whole neighborhood is being perceived as a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She goes on to say, "It's so horrible!"
Two afternoons inside the cordon were two police vans, and another one was placed right next to the outside.
Several policemen were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment.
All who have information are asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact "Crimestopers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 by name 247.
The Kromvela Statute in Parliament becomes the latest "history overwriting" scandal
It would be ethically justified in view of the activities similar to those of the Taliban, which resulted in his fanatical Puritan followers burying so many of the monuments of England's culture and religion.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Kromvell Society, said: "In view of the ongoing debate on the abolition of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Kromvell's figure outside Westminster's castle would also be aimed at.
Cromwell himself did not intend to do so, nor did he do so during the wars of the citizens of England.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed to his forefather, for centuries, because of the actions of Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft (Syr William Thorneycroft) is a beautiful image of Cromwell in the 19th century and is part of the history of a person who, according to many, is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith informed Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, were more than today, considered to be a parliamentary defender against external pressure, which in his case, of course, was a monarchy.
There will be further historical discussions on whether this is really a completely accurate picture of the topic.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the conflict determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable person who represents one of the parties to the then-as-you-know-how.
What she has achieved, being a patron of the Lord, is worth warming up and mentioning."
Pig-slaughtered till death of farmed farmers in China
According to the local media, the pig market in southwestern China attacked the farmer and killed him.
A man — mentioned only by his name Juan — was found dead with an arterial artery, all in the blood at the pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
Piglets are preparing to inject pigs into the Chinese Kinshasa (Qinghai) province on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had left the neighboring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found the man dead and discovered that the door of the door was open next to the pigs.
He told me that there was a big pig's father in the pig's chest with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the medical investigation of the courts confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) had taken the farmer’s heavy liver.
"My brother's legs were bloody and twisted," said the brother, "are mentioned only by his name Vu (Wu), written "Guyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan enters the market at about 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong to him or his brother.
The market manager informed Evening News that the pig was turned on to prevent its attacks while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, Juana’s family and market management discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other pigs are known to be attacked in humans.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man suffering from serious injuries.
Even 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of heavy pig in Wales had farmers forced by the tractor until his wife was killed by the animal.
After the farmer in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can act as a "gun shooter".
"They're just playful.
They like to enter, they're very knowledgeable... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The Orcana Rose End brings a wide and powerful case to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Orcana Rosa will weaken as she moves across the coldest waters along the northern coasts of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods of rain in northern Mexico and southwestern USA.
On the 5th afternoon (after North American Eastern time) the pink wind bras reached 143 km/h (85 July hour) corresponding to the Orcana category 1 and its point was 620 km (385 June) south-west of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
While above the Pacific there is a low pressure layer moving east towards the east coast of the United States. For pink with tropical winds approaching the coast of Laja California (Baja California), on Monday it will begin the mass of moisture deep from the tropical strip to the north-west of the United States.
On Monday, the pink part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (~25,4 cm) of rain.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the nearby low pressure inlet, will create a vast, powerful rainy zone in the southwest during the next few days.
1–4 inches (~2,6–10,2 cm) will cause hazardous sudden floods, double currents, and possibly landfills in the forest.
The moisture will be deep from the tropical strips of rain gases, which will reach 2-3 inches (~5,1-7,6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west part, especially most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (~5,2–10,1 cm) of rain is expected.
There are possible sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to go into the woods because of the tropical rainstorms.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into swift rivers, but they will soon bring local winds and sandstorms.
Low pressure will bring local strong lines to the South California coast as soon as possible.
It is possible that rain gases together exceed half a inch (~1,3 cm) and this can result in small double currents and sliding paths.
It will be the region's first rain gas during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain gases will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain will take over a wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday in the Four Routes region (DR Colorado, DA Jūta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October there is a potential for intense temperature fluctuations across the United States, as Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of the dramatic temperature differences in the Central US on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demoin (Des Moines), Aiova, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, try to form and expand the long summer heat.
It is expected that in most parts of the Central and Eastern USA, the beginning of October will be warm, reaching 80 degrees and more degrees (after the Farenheit; ~27 degrees by Celsius) in large areas from the south-east to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (after Fairenheit; ~27 degrees after Celsia), which would exceed an average of about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high probability that the first half of October will exceed the average in the eastern US.
More than 20 million people were listening to the Breta Caveno case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television channels were thrilled to see the Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno (Brett Cavenaugh) and Christian Blazesia Ford (Christian Blazey Ford), who accused Caveno of sexual harassment, which was claimed by a woman in the 1980 ’ s.
Political unresolved policy has still continued to cease broadcasting to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement organised by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had robbed them of their drink and tried to pull clothes during the high school dance.
The coffee unmistakably showed that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, on Friday, it was all observed by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the average interest of the viewers.
Data on other broadcasting organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And Nielsen is usually a problem, including people who are looking at the office.
To get a better idea, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of exclusion games or Oscar ceremony observers.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of the Cave, was the largest number of viewers, on average 5.69 million during the long-term hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS tied 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The interest continued to grow even after the hearing.
Fleik was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After issuing a statement that he was voting for the appointment of Caven, the senator noticed the CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by a protestant call, attempted to come to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
On the live radio, CNN stood for several minutes in the eyes of the naked, like a stork.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said some woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Flekks explained that his team had made a statement and informed before closing the elevator door that he had something else to say at the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasting organisations reflected on the live radio several hours later when the Committee of Justice was preparing to vote on the nomination of Caven to the Senate.
However, Fleiks claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would next week deal with the accusations made by the candidates by the minority of Democrats.
Flekiko was partly convinced of the negotiations with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Küns and several other senators, Fleik made his decision.
Fleika's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote for the approval of the Caveno without an investigation.
President Tramps has commissioned the FBI to investigate the charges brought against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja charges critics in political games about Brexit
In an interview with Prime Minister Tereza Mej, the newspaper Sunday Times accused people of criticising her plan to leave the European Union in "political games" with Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Tereza Meja arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to an interview with his first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexita's plan for the future of Britain's relations with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "completely absurd".
Type of Sims Shooting: Police have arrested Diteon Simpson, suspected of LSU's murder
Police have arrested suspects of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and arrested as accused of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge reported.
The officials posted a video showing Sims' match with Simpson, and the police mentioned that Simss lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS daughter WAFB reports that police glasses were found in the scene of the crime and that Simpson's blood was found on them.
After understanding Simpson, the police informed him that he had admitted to shooting the Way.
As the lawyer reports, he was given $350,000 in large security money.
On Friday, a team of medical experts from the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish presented a temporary conclusion stating that death was the cause of a gunshot in the head that hits the neck.
The Department thanked the Operational Group for seeking refuge in the State Police, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and the local population for their assistance in the investigation, which resulted in the arrest.
The LSU sports director Joe Alleva (Joe Alleva) thanked the territorial lawmakers for their "tolerance and work on behalf of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) the long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, he won on average 5.6 points and 2.6 dropped bombs in one game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "tried" and "shocked" about the type of death.
"That's what people always worry about," said the Way.
The volcano spreads its ashes across Mexico
Ash rising from the volcano of Pokatepetla has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
After an activity was observed in the container and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The Centre has observed multiple sweating and shaking.
The pictures on the social networks showed that the car windshields around Mexico, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are present with a flat ass layer.
The geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 km) to the south-east of the activation of the existing volcano in the capital, since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake devastated the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the annual independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of supporters of independence with the public order police and when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of a polarising separation vote in Catalonia.
The group’s masked separation supporters, who were blocked by the public order police, had their eggs filled with dusty paint, forming dark dust clouds on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements then arose later, and policemen used knives to prevent fights.
Several hours of independence support groups were involved in the confrontation with the united supporters of the protests, who scandalized: "For a long time for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people received medical attention because of minor injuries during protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid recognized as illegal but which the Catalans declared to be illegal, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains a great strain.
The voters expressed strong confidence in independence, although the voter's activity was low and those against separation voted mostly by boycott.
According to the Catalan officials, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region, and violent clashes arose.
The independence support groups had arrived on Friday night in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose another path.
Narkiss Teremezs (Narcis Termes), a 68 - year - old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won the last year's regional elections with a small but significant overpower, these parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or have been arrested and are awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and its subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig (Joan Puig), who filmed on the phone in support of police protests, said that the conflict had been fuelled by politicians from both sides.
"The judgment is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Uriol Junqueras, who has been in custody from the previous year to the court, announced that he will be candidates for the European Parliament's election next year.
"The candidacy of European elections is the best way to expose the democratic values of the regression and repression that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderia: men arrested after car crash in the building
Three men (33, 34 and 39 years of age) were arrested after repeated beatings against a building in London.
The incident took place at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reported that the doors and the building themselves were damaged.
It is possible that the car was shot simultaneously from the plane.
The Menga strike allows Livingston with 1-0 to win "Rangers"
Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) was the first door to ensure Livingston's victory
The supported Livingston rocked the Rangers, bringing Stephen Gerard his second loss in 18 games, played in the role of Ibrox Club Manager.
Dollija Menga's hit turned out to be decisive because the Gary Holt team was balancing the situation with "Hibernian".
The Gerard team in this season has not won guests, and the next week they will have to meet the leader "Hearts", of which they are left by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the European League "Rangers" took over the Vienna "Rapid".
As yet, Livingston continued to extend its series without losing in the division to six games, and the main coach Holts has still not felt the taste of breaking, since the previous month changed Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
Livingston doesn't take advantage of the opportunity against blue guests
The Holta team with its direct game, which in various ways made "Rangers" difficult, should have been in charge long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but dragged his attempt at the front door, and Alan Littgow’s attempt on his feet to block Craig Halkett’s head over the door line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the crucial doors came.
The Rangers allowed the freelance, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in order to provide the opportunity for Menga, who sat and got the doors from the center of the area.
At this stage, "Rangers" managed the bomb, but the protection of the guests turned out to be impenetrable and the guard Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) had to save Kelly’s doors.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop "Rangers" from working with Alan McGregor, and Litgovs left long doors in the combination of "Livingston".
The Livingston area continued to show up with central bombs, but two calls for punishment — after Halkett’s fight for a bomb with a replacement Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" Livingston performance — Analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdairs Lamonts (Alasdair Lamont) in the Tony Macaroni arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
Each of them was a fine man, continuing to cultivate hope, always improving his performance.
Their game style and personalities have not changed since their return to the highest asshole, but Holt has earned great praise for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was the great man who maintained the first-class organized defense, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall always remained discreet.
But the Rangers are missing the inspiration.
No matter how good they sometimes were under Gerard, they were far away from these standards.
Their last bomb was long-lasting — only once they broke into the farm area — and it is basically a call to rebuff "Ranger, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan waiting in Cologne with shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO partners.
They have disagreements about various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to the King to open a new giant mosque.
In the city live the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, as a reason for security, blocked the 25 000 people's efforts to avoid meeting in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — a large part of them were Kurds — also made known their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take him.
The mutual protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guest, some of whom German Turks consider a hero, while others deny it as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies in a car crash
In a car accident in London, a biker was killed.
Satursme took place on the Bestwood Street crossing with Evelyn Street, on the road with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, approximately 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the doctor provided help, but the man died at the scene.
Satursme took place several months after another bicycle wall in the Chialders Street (Childs Street), about a mile from the Sunday crash site. Then the driver left the crash site.
The headquarters police department announced that police officers were engaged in identifying men and informing their relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the scene, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured during trouble
The Prison Authority (Prison Office) reports that six prison staff were injured in an accident in the prison of a strict male regime.
The riots occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire approximately 09.30 BST on Sunday and continues.
In order to prevent irregularities involving eight prisoners and confined to one wing, Special Service staff were involved in the "Tornado"
Employees were treated with mild facial injuries at the site.
A representative of the Prison Service stated: "In order to resolve the incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, special training personnel were involved.
Six staff were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We are not going to settle for violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be sent to the police and will probably spend more time after the rest."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison chief was reported to have been treated in the hospital after the arrest of a prisoner.
And in October last year, officials responsible for dumping were sent to prison to resolve the serious accidents that staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Orkans Roza Féniques, Lasvegas and Soltleksitia are threatened by sudden floods (maybe they will benefit from the situation in the affected areas of the drought)
Arizona suffers from tropical depression rarely, but it is likely that it will happen early next week when the Orcana Rosa with the rest of her strength will move across the forest in the south-west, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, on the south and east part of Nevada, on the south-east part of California and on the south-east side of Jūtai, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Lasvegas and Soltleksitia.
It is expected that Rosa will head straight across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix Twitter reported that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical wind or depression status 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane of 40 JW (65 km) from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) predict 2-4 inches (~5.08-10.2 cm) of rain gases, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other woodland areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Klins Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches (~2,54 to 5,08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (~10,2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the pink rains can become a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although the possibility of applause is of very serious concern, some of the rains are likely to be good because the southwest is now suffering from drought.
According to Drought Monitor, Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, the Orcana Rosa road leads to Laja California (Baja California) peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose still with Orcana force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 JS (137 km), is located about 385 JS (~620 km) south of Punta Eigenia (Punta Eugenia) in Mexico and is heading north at 12 JS (19 km) hour.
The wind encounters later Pacific waters and is therefore present.
It is therefore expected that the hurricane with tropical wind forces will reach the coast in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rainy part of Mexico can be strong by creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rain gas will reach 3-6 inches (7,62-15,24 cm) from Lejascalfornia in the southwestern part of Sonora, for falls, possibly reaching 10 inches (25,4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rosa will head north, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then cross Arizona and arrive in the South Jut in the late evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its residues is very strong rain gas in Lejascalifornia, Sonora Northwest and the US in the forested southwest," said the National Centre for Orcanas.
It is expected that this rain will lead to life - threatening floods and floods of floods and droughts of land in mountainous areas.
Attack Midsummer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
A three - year - old and 20 - year - old man was arrested in suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16 - year - old boy in somerset with a hole wound.
The injured adolescent was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 BST.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition remained "stable".
The police reported that a 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers as well as a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Redstock, Eivona and Somerset.
The police have called for an appeal to anyone who could have a mobile phone about what happened.
Tramps claims that Kaveno is suffering from the Democratic Party of "malicious and Angry"
"The vote on Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the cruel and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramps announced at a meeting at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Tramps stressed that Kaveno was suffering from the Democratic Party's "wickness and anger" throughout his appointment process.
Caveno witnessed before the Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally rejected any Christian Blazey Ford (Christian Blazey Ford) charge of sexual harassment several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing of his accusations.
On Saturday, the president announced that "The Americans saw the Caveno "of excellence, ability and courage" on that day.
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a history of sporadic service to the people," he told the supporter's effort in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the environment in terms of the importance of the Republican activity in the interim elections.
"I have five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't apply, but I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Tramps objected that the democratics have undertaken the mission "to protest and oppose".
It is expected that the first of the main votes of the procedure in the Senate for the nomination of the Caveno will take place no later than Friday, the CNN informed the Senior Assistant of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people had been killed, many were simply injured when giant waves were striking the shores after a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulaves.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival in Palu, where up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves hit the coastal chair, destroying many of them dead and ruining everything that was on their way.
Cunami was born after a severe earthquake of 7.5 balls.
"When there was a tsunami threat last night, people were still working on the beach and not running away immediately, and they became victims," the representative of the Indian disaster reduction agency BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) briefed Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, beams and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that before heading toward the coast, the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people laughed in trees to save, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs taken by the disaster agency in the flight show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, and water-encompassed mosque.
After the drought, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency highlighted in the BPPT Communication that the energy released by the massive global earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times higher than that of the second world war on Hiroshima.
The location of the city was long, possibly at the end of the narrow curve, and the size of the cunami was increased.
The damage was described as "wide" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some bodies of victims were found lying under the roofs of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and injuries could be higher along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in the area called Dongala (Dongala), which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
"Communications" were completely broken, information was not received from Dongala," Nugroho informed.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Communication informed the Red Cross, adding that its personnel and volunteers are moving towards disaster-affected regions.
"Now it is a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not being informed that the tsunamis had hit Palu, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
A video that spreads on social networks is that a man on the top of a building deliberately calls people down the street that he's approaching a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall cracks against the shore, decomposing buildings and machines.
News agency "Reuters" failed to immediately confirm whether the material is true.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious electropade loss, which turned off the communication of the Pale, making it difficult for officials to coordinate salvation.
The officials announced that the army had begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still require much food and other first need items.
The city airport is open only to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo (Joko Widodo) planned to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba (Dosebau) said that the World Vision staff who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala, and now live in the muddy state of the office, had gone on their way to the long damage heaps.
"They told us that many buildings had been destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups have set themselves up to help victims of disaster, some have complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to the city with great experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, the financing of foreign organisations, resources and personnel may only occur if the postal area is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government declares, 'Well, it is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international assistance, but such status is not yet established.
When Paul arrived the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the people were still missing, hoping that their love would become a miracle that would make life more pleasant during natural disasters.
A little boy was dragged out of the tax Saturday.
On Sunday, the woman was released safely under two days ’ dust, beside her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandon (Gendon Subandon), a national paragliding team coach in Indonesia, had prepared two of the unknown paragliding paragliding Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others from the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their grandchildren.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I'm learning emotional burden."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released on the paragliding team, he sent whatsApp's reports for hours to the participants in the Palu competition who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
The bugs break 26 750 dollars at the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement by the Police Department of Newport, on Friday morning, a robbery would cost 26 750 Brink's to a staff member who filled out the ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the entertainment complex ATM and had prepared to fill it with more money," said Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "from the back hit a Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money for the ATM.
According to the press release, several suspects were reported to have left the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
All who have information about their identities should contact the NYPD 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the repertoire changes its name to Ye
Reperis Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced the change on Saturday, he wrote: "Boutne, who has previously known as Kanji West."
At 41 years of age, West was already called Ye, and used the title "Ye" as its eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The composers of this show tell us that he is replacing the singer Arian Grandi, who stopped the work of "emotional cause".
Vest has told us that it is not only the abbreviation of his current professional word, but it also has religious significance.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "You"," West explained earlier this year, discussing his album name with the radio director Big Boy (Big Boy).
"Then I am you, I am us, it is us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought about good and bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more thoughtful about what we are."
He is one of several famous repertoires that have changed his name.
Sean Combs, who has so far been known both as Puff Daddy and Fr. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love (Love) and Brother Love (Love Brother).
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with the West, is also, and has not used thought marks and big letters.
The President-elect of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador, has promised never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody return of students.
Lopess Obrador on Saturday "Tlatelolco Plaza" promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by the army was launched, killing even 300 people during the time that the left - handed movement of the students spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has vowed to support the new Mexicans by issuing grants to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and the lack of education brought young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains the investor and artificial intellectual practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after the various US government bodies had made announcements about the artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacked an artificial intelligence strategy.
Until last year China started its plan: its goal is to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The bilateral research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries have so much left in the US, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Li said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that double funding could double the possibility that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US.
Li, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, is the executive director of the "Sinovation Ventures" who has invested funds in one of China's most important art companies "Face++".
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon (Karnegi-Melona) worked at the University of Carnegie worked to create an artificial intellectual system that would impress the best Othello (Revers) player in America, but later he was the leading worker of Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese branch of Google.
Li acknowledged the previous technology competitions organised by the US government, such as "Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when it would be prepared next to identify people with ideas about the future".
"Scientists often have to work very hard to obtain government grants," says Lee.
"It's not China that drives leading scientists, it's big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have paid university awards for their work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with the degree of philosophy doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China published its next generation of artificial intelligence development plans.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Fund provides funding to people in academic institutions, like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the U.S. Defence Department (USD) established a single joint intellectual centre to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the White Nams announced the establishment of a special committee on intellectual matters.
And this month's DARPA (the Central Research and Development Organization of the US Ministry of Defence) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Fund, on the other hand, is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, the US legislation, which was responsible for setting up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been operational for several months.
Macedonians in the referendum on the change of national name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the "Nordic Republic" by taking a step to address the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name shows claims to its territory and has imposed veto Macedonia on NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that the changes were affecting the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gorge Ivanov (Gorge Ivanov) has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns as to whether the voter's activity will reach at least 50% that is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
The referendum newsletter asks the question: "Are you participating in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev (Zoran Zaev), object that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation, such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians to live freely, in the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgeevska (Oliver Georgievska) in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in Parliament.
The National Elections Commission informed that no violations had been reported until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I am going to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski (Gjose Tanevski), a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and his son Duško (Dushko) gave their vote in a referendum in Macedonia on a change of name that will open the way to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica Macedonia.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardakov), prepared a small scene and arranged chairs for tents that had been laid by those in the referendum boycotts.
"We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with an elevated head, not through the door of a servant," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have a self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the European integration of Asia."
Prime Minister Zajevs argues that NATO participation will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that most of the votes will be cast because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote.
He said the result "yes" will "approve our future".
In a poll published on Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research (Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research) shows that 30 to 43 per cent of the voter – less than the required activity – will take part in the referendum.
Another interview conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57 per cent of the voters planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, there must be 50 per cent of the voter's activity and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchester "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) goes through the entire "Brighton" protection to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling (Raheem Sterling) added the protection of Brighton by allowing Manchester City to win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England with 2:0.
Agvero had the impression that the benefits of his door were ridiculous at 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a hit in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He wrote out between the three Brighton defenses, and he was in the open field.
Then Agvero's got four green hooks.
He's bringing the bomb to one of the guards, and then he's running his victory on another side of Brighton's field.
Then he made a left-hand turn when he reached Sterling.
The attacker of the English center used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put in the case a good football tooth to reach the Brigton guard Matthew Ryan, striking the bomb on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," "City" manager Pep Guardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We discussed playing 55, 60 minutes with him.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the doors at the time.
But it was Sterling, which provided the original advantage of Sky Blues at the Prime Minister's speed.
The doors were opened at 29 minutes.
Agvero played in that play the bomb got deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful bomb along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
Several seats were made in the Sane until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the bomb to the next gate pole.
The ski blues center attacker easily entered the bomb network just before crossing the border.

Sugar wants to get problems "Rockies"
Since "National" does not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart.
However, Scherser (Scherzer), who is always ready to compete, hopes on Sunday to use the option against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies will be the current exclusion games. And Rockies in the Western National League group is in charge of one game against Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies has printed at least a white card Friday evening with 5:2 winning Nationals, but still haven't won their first title in the division.
"Even if we play the same game, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the air here, in Denver, with the effort and the other team, will probably be the worst I'll ever meet this year.
And then why would I not want to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced which will start the game on Sunday, but, as the news says, is ready to allow the Shercer to make a move.
Schers, who will have it at the beginning of the 34th, on Thursday the annual sessions were held in the "bulpen" part of the outdoors, and on Sunday the usual rest will be the bomb.

Tramps organize myths in West Virginia
The President-in-Office mentioned the situation in which his elected High Court candidate, Brett Caveno, had entered, while at the same time talking about the importance of the activities of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
"In November everything we've done is under threat.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is really very, very serious — I did not apply, but I did, and that is why I am everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Tramps continued: "You see this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats who are acting right now.
And they have committed themselves to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal.
They don't care what they hurt, which they have to violate to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission "to protest and oppose".
"And you have seen the same thing in the last four days," he stressed, calling the democrats "good, bad, bad and unfair."
He called on behalf of the Senators of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee of Justice Dianne Feinstein (Dianne Feinstein), to which the viewers responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It's intolerant to the open
No wonder the Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to submit to censorship.
Finally, I am in the last line of Members of the Socialist Party, who have been informed that he is not desirable, because we do not hide our views.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, in Parliament, went along similarly because she was determined against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policy, national security, Europe, ironically, but those were issues in which Jeremiah did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the Leborists meeting in the eastern part of Notingema said on Friday that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my local Labour MP were exactly those.
Unfortunately, at many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and the promises of a "friendlyr, safer" policy have long been forgotten, if at all.
It has become increasingly clear that the Leborist party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable for party management.
This began soon after Jeremiah became the leader: colleagues, whom I think are similar to our political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never otherwise agree to — whether it is national security or the single EU market.
When I speak in public — and I do not, in essence, what I say — is followed by a talk about the use of social networks, calling for a ban on candidates for the next elections by exposing the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more successful than some of my colleagues because my comments are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and commitment of my colleagues who daily face up to the flow of sexual and racist accusations, but never hate obedience to avoid.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin announced that the Leborist party had to select a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity and with every expression of distrust or change in the rules of choice, the party will be narrowed down.
Over the past two years, I have often been given advice by asking not to go to bed, think what I'm saying, and then with me "all will be fine".
But that is not why I have decided to take part in politics.
Since I had joined the Labourers back 32 years as a student in response to the failure of the Techera government, which had literally led to the destruction of my integrated school class, I have had the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need — both as a member of the local council and as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I been in the past.
No one in the East of Nottingema had reason to doubt my position on politics and in areas where I would not agree with the existing government.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the state is determined to move towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leborist Party.
However, the only thing I want to report is not meant for Notingema's "Momentum", but for its voters regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of the refusal to apply or of reminders that no one in politics will stand in the way that I think is best for all of you.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unquoted "Air" reaches the highest level in the table
The last two attempts may have resulted to a certain extent in the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Air has deserved to triumph in this amazing Scottish championship match today.
Now they're on the top of the table, the only unaided team in ten.
After all, it was both their great protection and much better use of the opportunities that led the farmers, and coach Peter Martyr (Peter Murchie) has every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in all our games and we are still not killed, so I have to enjoy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All respect "Ayr," they used their opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, made by Frazier Klimo, was "Air", but the yellow card for Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, where he had been awarded "Warriers", changed the numbers of "Melrose", and Jason Begots (Jason Baggot) held an unrealized bomb.
The climate increased Air's control with a penalty, just at the end of the half-time, he won points, then carried out a solo attempt, so the air stopped with 17-5.
However, Melrose half-time started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was made by Begots, reduced the retreat to 5 points.
There was a long break, because Ruiris Nott suffered a serious injury and was delivered to the courts away from the field, but when the game began "Air" moved forward rapidly when Staford McDowell (Stafford McDowall) made an attempt to implement the Klimo.
The captain of Air then received the yellow card by Blair Macpherson, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player — with Bruce Colvine’s attempt that was not carried out.
However, the farmers got caught up, and when Struan Hachinson (Struan Hutchinson) received the yellow card about crossing the Klimo without a bomb, from the punishment corridor, Macferson made the song "Air" in the back of the mill.
As in the past, the Klimo bomb was carried out almost immediately after Kyle Rowe (Kyle Rowe) took over David Armstrong in the field and sent the Flanders to Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt.
The "Still Game" star seems to plan a new career in the business of restaurants
Ford Kieran (Ford Kieran), a comedy serial "Still Game" star, seems to be planning to take part in the hospitality business, as it was revealed that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he creates and which he participates with his old partners in the Greg Hemfill comedy.
The duets have announced that the next ninth season will be the last show, and Kirnan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Avingermorn Limited.
The shareholder refused to comment on the story, although the source of "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kirnan planned to participate in the "future restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us!": the plain Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the pipes in the Fleet Stabe Lapas.
Public buildings have raised blue flags in the ocean.
Fleet base ships from Lake Titicaca until the Amazon is hit with a guess: "We have the right to the sea.
Its recovery is our responsibility."
The memory of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century in the land of ordinary Bolivia is still alive, just as it has been in the Pacific for a long time.
This hope is likely to be the highest for decades since Bolivia has been awaiting the International Court of Justice's judgment on 1 October after five years' examination.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts, the outcome is expected," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla (Roberto Calzadilla).
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice judgment on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of the Bolivian requirement that, after decades of negotiations with interruptions, Chile is obliged to discuss the sovereign exits to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic local president, Evo Morales (Evo Morales), who is waiting for a controversial fight for a re-arrangement next year, is also very interested in the Monday judgment.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific," he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that Bolivia’s judgment for the benefit of the courts is unreliable and, even if it is adopted, there are no major changes to be expected.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the territory of Chile, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is taken no more than six months after the final examination shows that the case was "not difficult", explained international law expert Paza Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And not for the last four years, but on the contrary, they have been slowed down.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morale’s military rhetoric in Chile has depleted the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their negotiations once again, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged consignments since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, when President Edward Rodríguez Veltzé (Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé), did not agree that the court had made an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have the "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility "to place the point for 139 years in the long conflicts from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used marine problems as political hooks.
"Bolivia will never give up its rights to access to the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to discern what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will renounce nuclear weapons only if it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) said that his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons unless they were able to trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the pledges made by the leaders of the two countries during a meeting in Singapore.
Her comments came to light at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was ready to resume diplomatic measures to prevent nuclear leakage, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leaders Kimu Chenu.
Ri claims that they are "fantasias" hoping that the United States will continue to declare the end of the Korean war unresolved and will leave North Korea on its way.
Washington is cautious about consenting to the declaration before Phenjana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up the weapon that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee her safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare the next Kima meeting with Tramp.
Paris fashion show introduces with the latest massive headline on the way to you nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced the viewers with a row of absurd, huge head-to-head object in the spring/summer season collection of 2019, which sparked the Paris Fashion Week style background.
These designers have sent their amazing achievements to demonstrate fashion.
Valentino’s most outstanding conclusion was a beautiful blue hat decorated with colourful broad edge that surrounded the heads.
Massive accessories included gemstones, magic hats, and even pineapples — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a series of strange masks — just before he was born.
Many of the colored masks were made up of lips, and they were soon added to Hannibal’s reading rather than to high fashion.
One of the compositions was a reminder of the breath movement, with pipes and glasses, while the other resembled the frozen cone.
And if you want to go on in a massive fashion, then it's time.
Styling observers believe that huge abrasions are possible on the way to you nearest High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" – the soles with two feet (~60 cm) on the broad sides seem to have worn all the way from Rianna to Emily Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkovski).
Very impractical hats as a cult object’s status on all social networks lead to another major conclusion on the subject — the sum of salmon, almost as large as the swimwear model that carries it.
Reddish-yellow rhinestone bag, processed with rhinestone bars and equipped with white leather gloves, took a special place "Jacquemus' La Riviera" in the spring/summer season collection in the Paris Fashion Week.
Slavenių stylist Lukas Armitage (Luke Armitage) explained FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in central business street stores next summer because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge size accessories."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has preserved it in 2018 when the results of excellent exams have been obtained on a regular basis, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art and other social events.
The aim of this school, which is attended by 30,000 educators in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to ensure the best level for their grandparents and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their children for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that today’s languages are still popular and desirable in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to people in the language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it will remain in his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to establish relationships and gain trust in people from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams held in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The data from the Scottish Independent Schools Council of 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest grades in Chinese A and 72 percent of those who received German, 69 percent who received French and 63 percent who received Spanish.
This shows that support for independent schools in Scotland is a vital foreign language skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, as an object of choice, are assessed in independent school programmes as high as those of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) groups.
The 2014 survey of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17 per cent of employers as a reason for the inability to fill the vacancy mentioned a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
By increasing the work opportunities that will require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will bring them real benefits in the future as a result of such long - term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several languages.
According to your 2013 survey of more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 per cent did not understand the foreign language well enough to hold the conversation, but the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit number of people, 15 per cent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to learn the language.
Several languages, especially the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with a better opportunity for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of learning languages.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while other languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the future of the United Kingdom, will be taught by 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be experts in the field.
The independent schools of Scotland are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to make progress in order to have a future.
At present, the global business environment cannot deny that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il must be done (It must be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron will be debited by Lakers on Sunday Sandjego
Fans have finally waited for the moment when Lebron's first game will take place in the composition of Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the pre-season opening game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets Sandjego.
However, it is still important to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudelt wrote on Twitter that James is most likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As James continued his practice this week, he asked about his plans for the six pre-season games series of Lakers.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trampa myth in West Virginia time, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Willing, West Virginia, launches a series of myths.
This is the first of the five planned Trampla meetings next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his election to fill the vacancy has been suspended in the Supreme Court, the purpose of the Trampa is to gain support for the interim elections expected, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control in Congress after the vote is delivered in November.
What is going to happen today in Trampa in West Virginia, and how can you view it online?
Trampa residence in Villing, West Virginia is planned on Saturday evening, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trampa myths in West Virginia You can watch online channel YouTube.
Tramps is supposed to be talking about hearing this week in the Bret Caveno case of the Supreme Court candidate who has been charged with sexual assault and the Senate's vote is expected to delay approval for a week while the FBI conducts the investigation.
However, the main objective of this bat is to help improve the situation for Republicans that are expected to be elected in November.
Therefore, the campaign of President Trampa shows that this next week's five meetings are "achieving volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority belonging to them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to "Reuters".
"Congress control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible because we are launching an active campaign season," said Trampa, a campaign representative who did not want to reveal his name, "Reuters".
This evening's residence, which is planned for "Wesbanco Arena" in Willing, may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and reflect it in Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time during the last month when Tramps will visit West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help the candidate of the Senator of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign to Morse that the president has to come in to help improve the results of the survey," according to Professor Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Riedera Cup 2018: The United States has demonstrated its commitment to fight to maintain high hopes for Sunday matches
After three sessions in "one word" afternoon games in the form of "foursome" were possible exactly what was needed for this Raider's cage.
The athletes like to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
So, where do they think success is now?
"They were in charge with six points, but now with four, as I think it means in its own sense that success has turned to us," said Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth).
Europe, of course, is privileged because it is managed by 4 points, but 12 more will be played.
Spitt explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their seas and they have reason to be optimistic, of course, also in the person of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast about three points out of four.
Spytis has been destructive from the first site to the hall, and is an example of the winner.
Those gutular bells became increasingly louder as his round continued, the decisive sitter was made in the brat to reach four times the same number of seats when he and Thomas had retreated for two seats after two.
Her sitting in the throttle, which won their victory 15 , was perceived with a similar call, from them, for his conviction that the American team had not yet been expelled.
"There really must be a deep rock, and worry about your cat," Spitt said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 minutes to make a success.
The only players who have won more points in the last two days than Spīts and Thomas are French Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, who will undoubtedly enter this Rider fight story.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are left behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molivud was the only couple who had gone without a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at nine last rides on Friday morning.
This happening and how their energy flows to this lunatic effort and again convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flitwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun drops across the Le Golf National.
I want both at the same time in different situations.
However, the talks on the European triumph were early.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quickly finished with this morning's fourballs hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren.
Bogis and the two doubles in the front nine led to the Spanish and Swedish cassava, and they were not even close to be exploited.
But there is no one who will help us to finish Sunday.
The games "fourball" and "foursome" formats are so exciting to watch in close proximity due to the interaction, watching what advice they give, and what not, and how the strategy can change the situation in a moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last few days it is in far-reaching, but this game in the form of "foursome" has shown that the US team is committed to fighting for which many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
European selection of Raider's cup last day is in charge 10-6
The European selection of Raider's team will start on the last day in good leadership after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" competition ended in 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari (Francesco Molinari) were in charge of two victories over the heavy-working Tiger Woods, which increased the number of "Le Golf National" to four.
Tomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) a European team to maintain the trophy that Hazeltine lost two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning competition in fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. was more energetic in the form of "foursomes", winning two cats, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Fury's team needs 8 points on Sunday at 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European first-year who won four points in a row with Molināri, named Molliwood after a sensational week's end, is only the second couple in the Rider's battle history, who won four points in the first four cats.
The experienced Woods and Patrick Reed in "fourballs" they then broke the weary Woods and American youth Braison Deshambo (Bryson Dechambeau) with an even more sensitive result 5&4.
Wood, which held two games on Saturday, presented a great game for the moment, but he has lost 19 of the 29 girls in fourballs and foursomes formats, in addition seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break before the morning games "fourballs", returned to partner Henrik Stenson's "foursomes" to call Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who took the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, although the day in south-west Paris was a pleasant and stormy wind.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spitts and Justin Thomas, set the stage for two points on Saturday.
They expressed 2&1 against the Spanish John Ram (Jon Rahm) and Ian Poulter (Ian Poulter) in "fourballs" format and returned later to call Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 "foursomes" after losing the first two posts.
Only twice in Raider's history has the team played 4 points in deficit games, but as owners, the Farika (Furry) team only has an undisputed result to maintain the trophy.
After two days in the second place, it seems, Sunday counterattacks will be problematic.
North Korea has declared that in no case shall it be unarmed unilaterally, without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had experienced "significant good will steps" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear-weapon and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear-weapon attempts and the promise never to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the US," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be unilaterally armed first."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korea's rejection of Washington's "staged" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea will be rewarded for steps taken gradually, his statement left the impression that it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation as Phenjana had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Čenuna and Donald Trampa, the first US president and North Korean leader, at a meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve the "Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Tramps promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has announced that Phenjan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not acceded to the call to facilitate serious international sanctions applied to North Korea.
"The US insists that "denuclearisation must be first", and increases the level of pressure created by the sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even in opposition to "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on the road is empty fantasies that people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not discuss the intentions of the second meeting of Kim once with Trump, whose US leader had specifically mentioned speaking this week at the United Nations.
In his speech, the Minister particularly highlighted three Kim meetings with South Korean leaders, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months, and added: "If the other party were South Korea, rather than the USA, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this end."
However, Ri’s tone of speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the designation of North Korean missiles on the continental part of the United States is inevitable after the name Kimu was named “Smoker” in the suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done, and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it does not matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for what he has done.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously continued without any errors until final and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up its sanctions since 2006, in an attempt to secure the financing of the phenjan nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then informed that he would visit Phenjan again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were not successful.
He left Phenjana in July, saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of "gangster's worthy demands".
North Korea's meeting with Mun this month was committed to disassembling the weapon polygon and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to his statement, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Tramps promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject of how to get enough rest
A new subject of study at Harvard University this year has found that students are sleeping more, and it is an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutalism, which includes the over-represented study of caffeine overnight.
One professor found that the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital (Brigham and Women's Hospital) a specialist developed a teaching subject that he believes was the first subject of such a kind of training in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject of teaching was given to him after his talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, "Why is this telling me just now that I'm in my last class?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the subject presented, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sports achievements and improve overall well-being.
Paul Bareira (Paul Barreira), professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University Health Services, informed that the university decided to take a course after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly training process includes interactive series of tasks.
One part is a picture of the doors of the dormitories where students click on coffee cupboards, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports affects sleeplessness and how important a sleeping routine is.
In the other part, students are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how your health will affect smoking cigarettes," added Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that boasts the ability to learn all night still exists and added that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became a more serious problem.
He explained that sufficient quality sleep must be the student's "secret weapon", to combat stress, stress and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain into hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a subject after attending one of his professors last year’s lectures in Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of the lesson had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who are receiving post-graduate education to develop a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students install a modulator not only at the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as keep in mind how people damage "blue lights", which emits electronic devices screens and LED lamps, because they can disrupt the daily rhythms by making it difficult to sleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": The man's door surrounds the Gerard virus
"Rangers" played another sad game when Dollija Mengas (Dolly Menga) satin Stephen Gerard (Steven Gerard's cover team decided 1 - 0 to lose against Livingston).
The Ibrox team has been hoping to win the first victory since February 4:1 St Johnstone triumph, but the Gary Holt team has won his second loss to Gerard in 18 games since he became the club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish championship leader Hearts.
Menga was pumped into the doors seven minutes before the end of the half-time, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration was never seen after an attempt to balance the result.
"Rangers" falls to sixth place, while "Livingston" climbs to third place, and only "Hibernian" can overcome it in the face of the door difference.
And "Rangers" may be another problem, because the judge's assistant, Calum Spence, needed medical attention because of the head trauma, which was apparently caused by the further end of the exhibition.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind Air, reaching the Betfred cup semifinal.
Holts, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players, who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained team suppressed the opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the bomb more often, but Livingston made better use of what they did.
They had to get the gates two minutes after the start of the Mengos first game in the direction of Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's (Allan McGregor's) gate, but the center player left his big chance.
The remote Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense of Alan Litgovs (Alan Lithgow) was able to spread the bomb only to a long-standing rear pole.
"Rangers" took control, but there was the impression that the last third was expected to play, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that he had to take a 15 - minute sentence, after he had met Stephen Loles (Steven Lawless), but Judge Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian invitation.
The Rangers did only two seats in the first half of the year, but the end of the attack by former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly did not prevent Lassana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibaly) with his head, nor the faithful Ovie Ejaria (Ovie Ejaria).
Although Livingston may have changed the course of the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that they had already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" was no longer finished with Jacob's long planned combination.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Galagher (Declan Gallagher) launched a bomb to Scott Robinson, who maintained balance and chose Meng for a simple end.
On the break, Gerard Kulibali replaced Rayin Kent (Ryan Kent), and it almost immediately affected the game, because the semi-guard sent a bomb to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately block from his line.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play how they like it, Lithuania and Halket performing one spirit session after another.
The Holta team could have continued to lead in the final phase, but MacGregor played well in stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a head start.
"Rangers" replacement Glenn Midlton (Glenn Middleton) later asked for another sentence, after he had hit Jacobs, but he ignored Tomson's request again.
Almanahs: inventor of Geiger counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morning almanah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelms "Hanss" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist, was born.
Geigers developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result, was a device known as Geigera’s counter.
In science, the adopted and retained Geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" (Coronado bells), where the main roles were played by externally unconvinced cowboy scientists Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these ears, you'll be able to hear how the atoms work because of the radioactivity produced by these minerals."
Evans: "It's really a bird!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that is called on his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells
When using this method, the patient obtains immune system cells that are converted into a laboratory
Then they will be able to see the protein characteristic of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine presents promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced that her ovary cancer had died for more than 18 months.
The method is to obtain from the patient’s immune system cell by converting it into a laboratory in order to ‘monitor’ a number of tumour-like HER2 proteins and then inject these cells back into the body.
In Betesd (Bethesda), the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Professor J. Berzovsky (Jay Berzofsky) informed: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumours," including breast, ovaries, lungs and severe and right-wing bowel cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach when the patient receives immune system cells that were "learned" as an attack on the human tumour cells has occurred in one type of leukaemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, clothes in MAGA shoes, attacked Trampa critics.
It didn't end well.
Kanje West was staged in the study of Saturday Night Live during the performance following an independent presentation in which he celebrated the US President Donald Tramp and announced that he was in the presidential election in 2020.
After finishing the third song last night, which was called Ghost Town, during which he wore Make America Great hats, he began to whiten up the sound phrases about the democrats and again stressed his support for Trappam.
"Only many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was interested in racism, then it would be a long time ago to leave America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with an exhibition with Matt Damon in the main role in which Hollywood star praised Brett Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) at the Senate Judicial Committee on the charge of Christian Blazey Ford.
Although this has not been transmitted, the material with West Loved Social Networks has been uploaded by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to throw West away like that.
And Vest still felt sorry for the viewers for having treated him badly because of his baldness.
"They mocked me in the back!
They said, "Don't get out there with those hats in your head!"
They mocked me!
And yet they said that I had lost touch with reality," said West, according to the Washington Examiner.
The Vests continued: "Would you like to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to wear "your Superman's cover", because that means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love!"
"Variity" reported that his comments caused the viewer's swings at least twice, but the members of the show's team looked samurai, and at least one person told the press release: "The studio had a complete silence."
The wedding was last called to replace the singer Arianna Grande (Ariana Grande), who had died a few days ago by a friend of the rapist Max Miller (Mac Miller).
Vests samulsed many with a song (I Love it) that he performed in the champagne bottle costume.
The wedding was supported by the conservative group's leader, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most powerful people: PATEICOS, WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO!"
However, on the website of the talk show leader Karen Hunter (Karen Hunter), Twitter reported that West was simply "what he is, and it's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward people (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art"), which, I think, supports and whitens with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before this show's repertoire on Twitter, he announced that he had changed his name, saying that he has now become "a being known in advance as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another reperist Snoop Dog was earlier Snoop Lion, and, of course, an unsuspecting music legend Prince, replaced his name with a symbol, but then to "the artist who was once known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder at Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was found at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the Court of Justice on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Star of "Tron Games" Kitts Herringtons directed against toxic manhood
Kit Herrington is known as the sword-toring John Snow HBO's evil medium-time fantasy series "The Throne Games".
However, a 31-year-old actor has addressed the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kits explained that he thought there was a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic manhood in #MeToo era.
Another, who recently got married with his "Tron Games" partners Rose Leslie, also 31 years of age, acknowledged that this problem is important to him.
"I can't even think about what mistakes we've made with honesty right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in the aspect of this problem when they grow up, taking into account the existing problem?"
Another believes that television with its very male characters may be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity.
He continued, "What is born, but what is taught?
What are being taught on TV and on the streets that make young people feel that they need to be viewed as men?
In my view, this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because the problems with the young men are obvious."
He also acknowledged in the interview that he would not participate in any "Tron Games" continuation or device, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "the battle fields and horses are apnicated".
Starting with November Kits will play the main role of the restored "True West" by Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother's kidnapper.
The shareholder recently acknowledged that he considered his meeting with his wife Rosa as the best thing that happened to her as a result of the Throne Games.
"I met my wife in this show, as it in itself ensured my present family and my life from then on," he said.
In the series of fantasy games won by Rosa Emmy the other character John Snow's favorite Igriti.
The couple married the family owned by Leslie in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14% rapidly.
Health - care professionals report that over 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which shows changes.
Traditionally HIV spread rapidly as a result of blood transfusion in some parts of China.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased almost to zero, Chinese health care officials informed the conference in the province of June.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 each year.
The transmission of HIV as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but LGBT is said to have been frequently discriminated against.
In view of national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee has leaked the data of the Republican senators, focusing on "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the allegations that her staff member had published three personal information from the US senators of the Wikipedian legislature.
The L.A. Democrat said that the allegations were being spread by "ultra best" of air news and websites.
"Meals, lies and more negative lies," Twitter tweeted Votersa in its statement.
It is reported that the leaked information includes residence and phone numbers belonging to the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Jutta.
Information online appeared on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a hearing with the Senate group on the charges against Bret Caveno appointed by the Supreme Court for sexual misconduct.
The flood occurred some time after the three senators questioned Caveno.
Conservative, website sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the entry's identification IP address is related to the Waters office and revealed information about Waters staff, Hills informed.
"This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and completely false!" spoke Waters.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security is compromised by this fraudulent and false claim is in no way responsible for the flow of information.
This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and completely false!"
The Waters statement soon led to online criticism, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleiser.
"It leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not fit the Congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a warrior.
He must not speak of the accused's motives.
He must be calm and framed."
Fleiser's task was to compare the Votters' reaction to the democratic fall of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of excessive anger at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate who is running to get Votersa to lose the mid-term vote, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he recorded.
In its communication, Votersa informed that her cabinet had warned the officials and law enforcement bodies responsible of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the guilty will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John England 3's comment: Rovan Atkinson's half-lived exhibition on spy movies
It has become common to look for association with Brexit in every new movie with British charms, and it seems also applies to what has been revived, Johnny Anglà (Johnny English) showing adventure comedies, which began in 2003 with "Johnnie Angl" and was born in 2011 with "Johnnie Anglís Returns".
Is there a new export option for our nation, the extreme self-satisfaction, of how hopeless we are?
In any case, the unqualified John Anglim with his chosen eyes and unusually moving face has the right to create a garbage after the second resurrection — his name is more than any other signal that he is a broad spectrum comic character designed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the clever secret agent, who, despite his strange claims of overwhelming detail, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bin, and a little boy who plays one of the songs "Chariots of Fire" themes at the 2012 opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, unintelligible person whom Atkinson once pictured in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements in which he left chaos on his way.
The latest experience of Johnny England has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where John England is going on a helicopter in the middle of a armored suit, and propellers are just looking at his body for a moment.
Rekinson's ability to create a visual comedian impression is well visible, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially because the "serious" film brand, such as "007" and "Impossible Mission" itself, uses a comedy as one of the ingredients.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny Angilla's absurd fate is not as creative and objective as Atkinson's fake movie tricks of Bina's skin.
As is usually the case, Britain has fallen into serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has hacked into the British super-blind spy network, discovering the identity of British agents in all these areas, about a bad active agent — sadly the small Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the Pomozian and conflicted person who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing something with Theresa Meja-like characters, but there is not much in the scenario to work with.
In the field of research, her advisors inform that, as all active pressures have become apparent, she will have to recruit someone who has already retired.
And this man is the unmistakable Johnny Anglis, who is now working as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and he teaches obedient people how to work as a secret agent (a couple of funny jockeys), because Anglis offers to acquire a spy profession from his own foundations.
The English is being returned to the Vitalole emergency meeting and is being joined with his once-in-a-life assistant Bo, which is also playing Ben Miller.
Because now a married man is married, married to an underwater commander, a fun character who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role that Vicki Pepperdine (Vicki Pepperdine) has not been fully used.
And so Bethman and Robin have returned to the secret service of Her Majesty to meet the beautiful destiny of Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) of Ophelia Lodi (Ophelia Bulletin).
While the prime ministers have been dangerously trained by the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer cache.
Anglis and Bo begin their wild fun odise: masked about officers, they light a fine French restaurant; they create a distraction to sneak into the Volta luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
As much as possible is done for the end of the movie, however, the attractiveness and the craziness of the film has a lot of children's television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
Like the other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party rejects plans that British will work four days a week, but will receive salary in five days
Jeremiah Corbin (Jeremy Corbyn) is preparing to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to grant workers saved by the artificial intellectual revolution by giving them another holiday.
In such a case, the staff will be able to enjoy the three-day end of the week while receiving the same amount of salary as before.
Sources say the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The four-day workweek shift has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the senior representatives of the Leborist Party informed The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not take place in one day, but four days' work week is an idea that meets the Party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already promised to introduce four days of work in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Leborist party as such is not currently in favour of these hungers.
The representative of the Labour Party said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Leborist Conference last week to describe his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonella explained that he is committed to withdrawing the power of "directors for mass" and the public service company "speculants".
The Minister of Shadow Cabinet also plans that existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package because the Leborist government could implement the "reporting" because of the alleged injustice.
He also approved plans to include working companies in boards and to establish exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the private-sector companies' capital to employees who receive up to 500 pounds each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy answers "60 Minutes", or the FBI investigation into the Caveno case could change their views
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the Office could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Radio correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, in the course of the hearing procedure, that I spoke to Judge Caveno.
And I called unto him after that it came to pass, when the accusation was established, and said unto him, Didst thou do it?
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, the Grem's vote is evidently embedded in the stone.
"I have made a decision about Bret Caveno, and there will be a crushing accusation," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett strongly rejected it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the Festival of World Citizens, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens' Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will meet in the Grand Duchy of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes (Shawn Mendes), but also to increase their understanding of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the Global Poverty Project International Defence Group, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to this event (unless you wanted to pay for the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, making a telephone call or other important activity to promote an understanding of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, which has remained for 12 more years?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another so-called "clickivism" case when people think they really have something to influence by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter report?
The Global Citizen movement has claimed that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "operation" from its supporters in order to achieve various objectives.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to report commitments and policies equivalent to more than US$37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from activities for which at least US$ 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership established in the United Kingdom by investors and contractors who are committed to "helping children grow fully", promising to secure Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's incomplete diet after more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the United Kingdom government, donors, governments of other nations and citizens of the world like you, we can leave incomplete food in the history of social injustices," Treisija Ulllman, a representative of The Power of Nutrition, announced to the London concert in April 2018.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5000 measures were launched, calling on the UK Government to provide better food for mothers and children, the government announced the granting of funding to the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide food for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website— "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long way in which we will be able to cover up and suffer failure.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartement movements have done before us, so we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use war fleets to "block" Russia's energy exports – says Minister of Interior
"If necessary" Washington can use its war fleet to prevent Russia from entering the market, including in the Middle East, as US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke (Ryan Zinke) quoted as saying "Washington Examiner".
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, particularly in the areas where it operates under the legitimate invitation of the government, are an inspiration for research into new energy markets.
"I think the reason why it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe — in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
"The United States, through its military fleet, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot put its energy on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to visit the action taken by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization called the 'Energy consumer voice' in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation of Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and substitution," he mentioned, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent solely on fossil fuels.
It is further argued that the Trampa administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with much cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trampa administration officials and also US President Donald Tramps are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas management project that, according to Trampa, would make Berlin "dependent" from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which doubles the existing gas power of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlis believes that Washington’s project of fire-fighting is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," he said after meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Periju in Moscow in September with Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novaks.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation — the German Industrial Federation (BDI) — has called for the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a great problem if a third country interfered with our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) Ditter Kempfs, after a recent meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Vorena of Massachusetts will give serious consideration to his candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Verena announced on Saturday that she was serious about applying for the presidency post after the mid-term elections.
At the meeting of the House in Holioka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the presidential election.
"It's about time there were women in Washington who would "save" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," so her words are reflected in The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the election of the President of the United States."
At the meeting of the House, Warren referred to President Donald Tramp, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"My heart is troubled by what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticised Tramp and the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bret Caveno.
On Friday's Twitter report Varena said: "Of course, FIB investigations are needed before the elections."
However, the poll published on Thursday revealed that most of Varena's supporters did not believe that she should be candidates for the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe survey of the Political Research Centre/Journal of Suffolk University, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters claimed that the senator should not run for election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that more support had been received by former Governor Devals Patrick, with 38 per cent of the election and 48 per cent against.
In the context of the possible nomination for 2020, the election of a high profile will show the names of the members of the Democratic Party as former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
The news agency Associated Press reported that Baiden is committed to making an official decision by January.
Sara Peilina quoted Treka Peilina at the settlement of Donald Trampa
Treks Peilins (26) spent the year in Iraq following the call of the Karadesh in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"To whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after returning, I can extend to other families who face the consequences of PTSS and some dose vulnerabilities with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at Donald Trappa's residence in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilina called her arrest "an obvious problem that everyone remains invisible" and said about her son and other war veterans that "they return a little bit differently, they return patiently, they return wondering whether what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given to this country are being respected."
According to a representative of the Vasila Police Department, Den Benet was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women and with the holding of arms while in a riot.
18 states, Colombia with a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian region support a legal challenge to the new US policy that prevents refugees fleeing from the gang or violence in the family.
On Friday, representatives of these 18 states and the Colombian region in Washington submitted a brief statement to the court council to support the asylum seeker who faced the obstacles created by that policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the applicant Grace v. Session in the case, which the United States Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal policy, has not been discovered.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of her violent gang member" abused her badly, but the US officials rejected her request after asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Greis described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of US asylum seekers, as countries where the problem is widespread, as gangs and violence in the family.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing violence in the family to seek asylum.
On Friday, Attorney General of the Colombian District, Karl Racín, announced that the new policy "is ignored by some of the national, federal and international laws".
"The Federal Law provides that all requests for asylum shall be examined in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," was stated in a brief statement by the court councillor.
In addition, the lawyer mentioned in his statement that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants would probably become entrepreneurs and would "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sesons addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from violence in the family and gang abuse.
"Abstinence is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sesons said in his statement on 11 June on politics.
Asylum has never been designed to address all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Extensive rescue efforts by Paul, doubled in the search for survivors
The situation of the survivors was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Rice Kusuma, calming her naughty little girl in the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
"For a minute, the rapid medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants were visible when they returned to their ruined homes and moved into the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had suffered from an earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Haris (Dwi Haris), who had a broken spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army hospital, where patients were cared for by the strong after-harsis outside.
Her eyes burst with tears, recalling how a powerful earthquake began to strike the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he and his wife and daughter were together.
"There was no time to save.
It seems that I was impressed by the wall droplets," said Harris to the news agency Associated Press, noting that his family had arrived in the city for marriage.
"I listened to my wife's name for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador charges China's invasion efforts with advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came forward with four page long advertisements, highlighting the mutual benefits of the U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. Ambassador accused China of using the Beijing American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the annex paid to China Daily in the most sold newspaper in the state of Aiova, Des Moines Register, accusing China of attempting to interfere with the will of the United States Congress on 6 November, but China rejects it.
Trampa's complaint that Beijing is trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials told the news agency "Reuters", that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal that foreign governments place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasing trade war, as a result they apply a series of tariffs to each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Aiova, which supported the Trampa Republican Party, said experts from China and the USA.
Terijs Branstads, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Aiova, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion on Sunday's "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this inception by placing advertising advertisements on our own free press."
"By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses for its own benefit the so important freedom of speech and free press tradition for America by placing paid advertising "Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the ordinary Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of different views and you will not see the true reflection of such different views that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's disturbing economic trajectory, given that the media here is under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans who withdraw female voters from the mid-term elections involving the Caveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that the expected mid-term elections will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high and it is apparent that most Republicans have already been prepared to give their vote.
Such things cannot be recalled, "the Saturday article "The Hill" told Professor of Science at the University of Syracuse, Maksvela School of Policy, Grant Reeher.
Ríhers doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison)'s last-minute incentive to conduct an FIB investigation will be quite a reason to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or November," she said, according to Washington, D.C. on Friday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and national representative of the progressive movement "MoveOn".
On Friday morning, protesters in front of the Senate sang "November!" when the Republicans under the control of the Court of Justice chose to continue applying for the Caveno nomination despite the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg (Stu Rothenberg) told the news portal.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among the city-dwelling fluctuating voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29 years), who often do not go to elections even if the President does not like it."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she made allegations of sexual violence on the part of the Supreme Court candidate, analysts refer to the potential failure if Republicans continue to apply for this candidacy.
"The Republican Party has become a ridiculous mess," Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, who leads this group, who helps to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little divided about what they believe in fords and fords and fords, a little more reluctant to believe in the latter.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 per cent of respondents strongly or mostly tend to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent claim that certain or most tend to believe in the Caven's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleik’s encouragement, the FIB is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and at least one more prosecutor — Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee that Caveno had been drinking at the age of 17 against his sexual assault.
Ramireza claims that during his studies in Jeil, a candidate for the Supreme Court judge in 1980, a ballet showed her her genitals.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Børners-Lei (Tim Berners-Lee), an inventor of the global web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project "Inrupt" is a company based on the first code platform "Solid" opened by Børnersa-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with "Fast Company", Børnerss-Ley joked that "Inrupt"'s hidden intention is "dominating the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the new company.
"It's a historic moment."
The utility uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of work to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available simultaneously in one view.
The storage of personal online data is unique to the fact that only the user determines what and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company is referred to as "personal powers using data".
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates in Bärners-Li, Bruces, IBM's security platform, some external developers who are dedicated to the project work, and a voluntary encoder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the "Inrupt" website.
Kinderss-Li said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce complete changes during one night completely turning all their business models.
"We don't want their permission."
On Saturday, published by the platform Medium, Børnerss-Li said that "Inrupt" is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based "Solid".
In 1994, Bērners-Li transformed the Internet through the establishment of a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bērnersam-Li has had an impact on the discussions on network neutrality.
Even after the "Inrupt" launch, Børnerss-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web age," Berners-Lei pointed out.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Victorian Cross awarded to a priest during World War I
For the past 100 years in its hometown, the event is marked by the fact that the only Church of England priest has received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lt. Bernard Wen received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
On Saturday’s show in Richden, Northamptonshire, her two little children discovered a stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "excellently symbolic", that such a stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather had received an important award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazettee" on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vens led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very frequent fog and heavy fog and firefighting."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and with the utmost certainty led this line forward before the adoption of the large-scale zone, where three groups were formed.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Vena — just a few months before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's action was "like something I could never do and that at the same time is a very humble action".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also present at the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the show.
Michael Wen said that he felt "deserved to participate in this debt" and pointed out that "the value of the true hero shows the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead waited for Pig Pepu
Imagine spending the whole night watching Bellator 206, but at the end of this main event you are not allowed to see.
The Sanhos exhibition included 13 fights, including six main maps, which were broadcast live throughout the entire night in UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mosessi (Gegaard Moussi) and Rory MacDonald (Rory MacDonald) were about to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were reluctant to surprise the transfer to the Peacock.
Some were really confused when all night long, even early in the morning, they were left alone waiting for the battle to begin.
A fan on Twitter described the change of transmission to a child's multifilm as a "successful joke".
"The government has determined that the content of this kind is unacceptable after 6 a.m., so there was a switch to the children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President of marketing and communication.
"Stolen Pepa," "yes."
The company's president, Scott Coker, said he was working on schedule planning so that future viewers in the United Kingdom could see these transmissions.
"When we think about the re-transmission, I think we can sort of solve it," Kokers said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switchover, and they weren't positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical error.
But that was not the case. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem the next time.
We will stick to five fights, not six (as it has been so far).
It's a bad situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daily didn't feel good enough for his sexuality
The Olympic kidney Tom Daley (Tom Daley) claims that he grew up feeling less valued than others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he started attending high school.
While visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he began to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term programme, has been given several months of rest because of the disease.
As a result of Laverne's first programme, Daily said that growing up feels "less valuable" than others, because "the society is not accepted that both girls and boys can like".
He said, "Even today, I feel that I am not as good as others or that I am different, has been the main engine that has given me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there's something to keep people from being disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze medal of the Olympic Games has become the leader of a high-level LGBT campaign and has used his appearance in this year's Consistency Games in Australia, calling on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he could live openly and without difficulty and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champions said that the man of love, the American filmmaker in Dustin Lansa Black, whom he met in 2013, "suddenly not prepared".
Daily was 20 years old when Oscar’s senior prize winner last year said that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much for so little age" (his first Olympic games were 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who would have experienced similar surfaces and falls.
The couple became the parent son of Robert Ray Black-Daley (Robert Ray Black-Daley), and Delhi claimed that her "all perspective" had changed.
"The first year everything that mattered to me was the acquisition of a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? Life is the most important thing about the Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robby."
Her son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daily mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dead, and one of the last things he asked Delhi was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics in which he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I simply knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – entering the home in front of the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Heather Small performed "Proud", which reasoned with him on his way to the Olympics achievements and still lifts the zosad.
The program "Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11.15 a.m. after British summer time.
Michaelson, who left the form on the reserve floor on Saturday's Raider's ball game
The American Phil Mickelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record Sunday playing his 47th Raider's Cup game game match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turnaround.
Michaelson, who has already participated in the two-year-old championship, sat on the reserve floor on Saturday four ball games and two pair games.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as has often been the case with the US teams, the fifth winner divided his day by acting both as a supporter and taking part in his game with the hope of correcting what he was teaching.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even on top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the forced fight "Le Golf National" in the uneven field where inaccurate sitins are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Michelson will fight the exact British winner of the French Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four games this week.
If Americans who are left with four points at the start of 12 single-game cats are successfully headed, the Mikelson match could play a decisive role.
Furick expressed full confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, stretched me over my back, applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furiks.
"He is very convinced of himself.
He is an excellent athlete who gave so much to these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've ever imagined him playing in two cats.
I imagined more, but everything was threatened the way it was, and that's what we're going to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will send Nick Faldo's record in connection with the most played girls in the Raider's fight on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Rieder fight career, which it never really coincided with his individual record heights.
Michelson has won 18 victories, suffered 20 losses, and seven unsolved games, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some material benefits.
"He's fun, sarcastic and smart, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the latest players also liked to beat her up this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just games."
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a significant take-off can soon be achieved
From experience, European Selection Captain Tomas Bjorn knows that a major setback can easily turn into an unpleasant situation when fighting for Raider's balls in the last day's single game.
Denmark won five points over the Americans in 1997 in Valderram, where the opponent team, the captain of the Sive Ballesteros, won five points over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small score, winning with 141⁄2-131.2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we were significantly in the leadership of Valderram; we were in the leadership of Brooklyn where we were lost; and Valderram where we were winning, but only with a small advantage," said Bjorns (in the picture), looking at the victory of the 2018 release group with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, in the leadership of the 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me and every member of its team that nothing has ended.
Tomorrow you'll give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and focus on it.
I have always said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we are very well aware of what is on the other side of us — the world's greatest players."
Relaxing about what the performance his golfers showed, Bjorn said: "I never enjoyed being early.
There are new challenges ahead tomorrow.
Individual games are scheduled for tomorrow, and it's quite another thing.
It's great if at times when everything goes well, you have a partner with you, but in individual games your golfer's skills are fully checked.
This message you must pass on to your players, that is, that they will return everything in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partners, and he must also be able to show his best performance."
Unlike the Bjorn opponent team captain Jim Furiks will watch his players show their best performance directly in individual games rather than in partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of these important last days’ tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later as a result of the failure of the European teams to achieve sensational success, which is later known as the Miracle at Medinah in the golf world.
"I remember every damn word," he said, responding to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, joined his players in the fight of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the fast-paced scene you've experienced in Brooklyn, which you've experienced in Medina.
When such a impulse is broadcast in one direction, it creates great pressure for middle-range games.
We created our composition accordingly and engaged the boys in a way that seemed right to us. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the attack, and he joined Rory McIlroy in the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I cut the guys in such a order, because, in my opinion, it is best suited during the tournament," said Bjorns regarding the selected players.
Retired transfer of the new German flag to the operation
The German fleet's latest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014, thus replacing the ageing Cold War war warships, but it would not happen at least until next year due to the faulty system and the increasing costs, the local media reported.
The transfer of the main vessel of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ class of the ‘Badenes-Virtemberg Frags’ class to the operation is now delayed until the first half of 2019, reported in Die Zeit newspaper, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to join the Caraflot in 2014, but the adverse post-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the extensive project.
Four boats of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the car fleet in 2007 replaced the old Bremen class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful large-scale range, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it must be possible to place the new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the constant delay means that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries, have already become obsolete by the time of its entry into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate last year was believed to be in all headings when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard 'Blohm & Voss' in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned it back to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and equipment defects", which would render warships invalid if used in the battle mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor as the boats of the Baden-Wirtemberg class are operating around 120 large crews, which are only half of the older Bremen crew.
It also showed that the ship has too much weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to improve it in the future.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as those of similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the costs of the entire project (including training of the crew) also became a major problem.
It is said that its costs amounted to EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion originally foreseen.
The problems associated with the new frgates are becoming particularly important given the recent warnings that the German maritime forces will decrease.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the car fleet really "starts missing a useful ship".
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly congested, as older ships are being removed from operation but no new ones are being delivered instead.
He said regrettably that none of the baddens-Virtemberg class frigates have joined the Caraflot.
"National Trust" listens to the life of hidden birds
The new study carried out in some property of the Scottish Highland is aimed at discovering how bats use the screen during the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help them in their future protection measures.
Scottish "National Trust" scientists in Invere gardens in Westeros will explore punturs, pygmies, and brown gulls and water nightbirds.
Special recorders will be located in the main premises, which will track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all the records to determine the frequency of callous birds and what species of activities are taking place.
A biotope map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behaviour of bats.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which biota areas are the most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biota management such as the creation of stilts and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen significantly.
This land is threatened by construction and development works affecting the loss of the shelter and habitat of the silhouettes.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can mush paper and some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes during hunting.
They use a complex method to determine the location of the aid to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land maintenance throughout the country, is very serious about the problem of birds.
The organisation has at its disposal ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspection of bats and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for cod in Scotland owned by "Threave" in Damfris and Galova, where eight of the ten species of cod found in Scotland are slaughtered.
The property manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideally suited for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and generally suitable biotopes.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about birds, so the work we do here and in other property will help us to understand better what they need to survive."
He emphasises that it is important to check that birds do not move in the place concerned, as it may happen that, due to the unknown destruction of one mother's shelter, up to 400 mothers and their babies are killed, thus possibly destroying the entire local population.
The birds are protected animals and must not be killed, hunted, disturbed or destroyed by their hideouts.
The Scottish Bat Conservation Trust (BAT) staff member Elizabeth Ferela (Elisabeth Ferrell) has invited the company to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about birds, and we just don't know how they're doing."
Ronaldo's rejection of the indictment by ordering lawyers to sue the German Journal of the Court
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned him in the defamation of the charges against him as "bad news", claiming that people "want to pay attention to themselves", using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to file an appeal against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
Portuguese origins and Turin's Juventus football star are accused of excavating American Kathryn Mayorg (Kathryn Mayorga) in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid the woman $375 000 to keep her silent about the incident, he announced on Friday "Der Spiegel".
A few hours after this statement, Ronald 33, via Instagram, addressed his 142 million followers, calling this information "bad news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the camera told the handsome Ballon d'Or award winner.
"They want to become famous using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for my word, it's part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's good," laughing at the add-on player.
According to the information provided by "Reuters", Ronald's lawyers are going to sue the journal "Der Spiegel" in court for the statements they have made as "unacceptable reporting on suspicion of fundamental privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the infringement which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" class room "suite" in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Court of Justice of the state of Nevada, Ronald and Majorg went back to the hotel number of the player where he had won the female analytics.
Majorga claims that after that incident Ronald had fallen on his way and said that you were "by 99 per cent" "good boy", but had fallen into this "one per cent" trap.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronald confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it happened after a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of the injuries she had suffered at the hospital, but later she agreed to an outlaw settlement because she felt "fear of rape" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to agree to the terms of this agreement, as the incident left a lasting injury.
At the time of these claims, Ronald was threatened to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer, for 100 million euros, he moved to the Italian capital Juventus.
Brexit: The loss of car manufacturers in the United Kingdom "for all time regrettably"
"The United Kingdom "will regret it forever if after Brexit it loses its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars," said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Their concern is that Toyota UK has announced BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production near Derby's existing factory in Burnaston.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese auto-producer said that delays at the borders in the Brexit case could be put to the workplace without agreement.
In the last year, the Toyota plant, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Toyota Managing Director in Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have hesitated to withdraw from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims to close its mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are about the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line operates according to the principle of "specify time", where cars manufactured by order are required to supply parts from both the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disturbances at the border that could lead to some delays and shortcomings.
According to Toyota, it would not be possible to hold more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr Clarke said that the Chequers (Theresa May) plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that I would like to say not only to benefit at the present time, but also to use this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
"The certificate not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, is that we must be able to fully pursue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to state how long production could be stopped, but warned that long-term increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsuvallaris), who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is working at the factory as the Union's merger coordinator, said that his members felt more and more concerned: "From experience I can say that once someone's job is gone, it doesn't come back."
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trampa's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "refused for another week", because the fight with the High Court judge's candidate Bret Kaveno continues, he reported on Sunday to the White House.
Rosenstein monitors the link between the funds used by Trampa and Russia, as well as the possible failure to comply with the President's rule of law by Robert Mueller, who investigates interference with Russia's will.
For months now, in Washington, D.C., it has been suggested that Tramps will release the Deputy Attorney General and thus threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of the negotiations with Tramp and the possibility of leaving the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
On the last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he spoke up about his resignation.
Instead, we were notified of a Thursday meeting with Tramp, which was then held in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Tramps said he would not "be willing" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Committee, in which he testified to both Caveno and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Kristine Bleizia Forda.
On Friday, Tramps had the FBI investigate for weeks in connection with the charges brought by Caveno, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trampa Press Secretary Sara Sanders visited Fox News Sunday.
She replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or another week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sandersa has not conducted a White House press briefing since September 10.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sandersa said that the lack of briefings is not related to a bad attitude against the television reporter 'slava kaji', although she added: 'I do not deny the fact that they are famouskaji.'
She then proposed direct contact between Trampa as a result of an increased interest in the press.
"The President is involved in more questions and answers sessions than any president before him," she said and, without providing more information, said, "We are interested in the number."
Sandersa claimed that the briefings would continue, but "if the press would be able to ask the President of the United States questions indistinctly, it is certainly better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it a lot, and you see that we have done it a lot in the last few weeks, and it will happen in the press briefing place when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Tramps regularly answer questions by leaving the White House or by participating in open sessions or press conferences that are attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences rarely take place.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason this week in New York, devoting the reporter to an uncontrollable effort and a strange expression.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff of Scotland NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and support for Brexit.
Gina Freeman (Jeane Freeman) MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Frymana wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the summer on the withdrawal which led to the decisions to be taken this fall.
However, the UK Government is also preparing a possible scenario if no agreement was reached.
I know this is a very uncomfortable time for you.
Therefore, I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee regardless of their nationality.
The colleagues from both the EU and outside provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service and benefit our caring patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head trauma, Kristen Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation
In Tunisia, for the protection of Christian Abercrombie, an emergency surgery was carried out following the head trauma he received in a Saturday game, resulting in 31-27 attacks on Vanderbilt Commodores, reported the sports reporter "Tennessean" Mike Organs.
Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma was soon over.
"He came to the side line and said it was broken," said Reid.
While Abercrombie was on the side line, the coaches and medical personnel handed him oxygen, then put him on a stand and delivered him to the hospital for further investigation.
One of the state officials in Tennessee told Chris Harris that Abercrombius had been operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that at the moment "there is no information on the type of trauma/seriousness", and in Tennessee the state team is trying to understand when the trauma was coming.
Abercrombius, a representative of the Red Crescent, is in his first season after Illionise's exchange against the Tennessee state team.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had made a total of five blocks, which made up a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher national tax on the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will receive a higher national fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in line with the new Tory plan.
Such a step will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased national tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The national cash register provides that up to 120 million pounds per year can be collected, to be turned over to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher national levy by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and by diverting the funds obtained to provide assistance to homeless people, it will today notify Tereza Meja.
Such a step is regarded as an attempt to neutralise the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and speak to the more affluent part of society.
An increased national levy will be applied to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money they have obtained, to the government’s efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current national levy, including the application of a higher level charge imposed two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another home for rent, could be up to three percent.
The State Fund provides that such a measure may supplement its budget by up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built London property is purchased by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to stay at their home.
Many rich countries, especially in the capital, have become "spock cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson) called for a reduction in the national tax so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices while grabbing the land, but not using it, and urged Ms. Mejas to give up quotas for affordable dwellings in order to address the problem of British housing.
Mr Korbina has proposed a number of attractive house reform, including a reform on rent control and removal from the house for no reason.
He also wants to grant councils greater powers for the construction of new homes.
Ms Mejas said: "I mentioned last year that I would use my Prime Minister's position to restore the British dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means putting our woven housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and equip their lives.
It is not right, however, that housing can be equally easily purchased by foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many dreams about their home have become too far away, and the problem of expensive homeless people is still up to date."
Jack Ross: "My greatest goal is to lead Scotland."
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, claims that his greatest goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has taken the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now taking third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This evening he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren's introduction back in Scotland's prime season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B box, and that's all," said Ross to the Scottish BBC.
"But I grew up, together with my father looking at the game "Scotland" in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I was successful in running the club."
Rosa's predecessor is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims that he was not disturbed by the fact that he was following so many well-known leaders at the club's feet, before rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsvičas.
"My progress will now be evaluated as to whether I can return to this club as a prime minister.
Because of the structure and opportunities of this club, it is undoubtedly in the prime," he said.
"Returning to the club's prime minister will not be an easy task, but I'll probably think that I'll only be successful when this task is accomplished."
Ross is only in his third year in his career, some time ago acting as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period in the composition of Hearts coaches.
He then helped the Alloa club recover from the fall to the third level and during the same season helped St Mirren to win the title of the champion.
Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than his player's career at clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academic".
"They were perhaps true crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa."
"I really believed that management was my true call – much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange because I have made good progress, I have been able to live and enjoy certain heights as well.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of the stress and pressure involved, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to lead and now I do it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so well all my life."

The summer heat wave has caused Britain's less popular circles to collapse, but it has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The data collected showed that sales of freight and bar had increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but they had decreased by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin, representing the CGA’s business consulting agency, which collected data, said: “The time of the sun and England’s prolonged participation in the World Cup fight meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. the crop profit had increased by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurant experienced a fall.
Restaurants, whose sales decreased by 1.8 per cent in June, experienced an even more severe situation in July.
The situation in the bowls and bars was most grateful because they experienced much higher levels than the restaurants experienced a low level.
The food - based bowls are also hard from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant workers felt.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In bowls and barrels, the market for beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the market for food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM relax and hospitality analyst Paul Neuman (Paul Newman) said: "These results continue the trend seen at the end of April.
Situations and the impact of broad social or sports measures are the main factors determining the off-the-spot market.
It is no surprise that the groups of restaurants continue to fight, although the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the extra real cost pressure.
With regard to food providers in the long and hot summer, it was not possible to arrive at an even more inappropriate time, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we normally experience in August will provide the most needed accommodation."
In July, the total sales increase between the bowls and restaurants, including in the new companies, reached 2.7 per cent, reflecting a decrease in the sales volume of the brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the sales monitor for the UK freight, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and this has been incorporated into the industry criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey involving 20,000 high school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have the "main" account to show their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years of age, forms social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey involving 20,000 high school students, the number of fake profiles on Instagram’s photo sharing site has grown rapidly.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clean main" account to show their parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who was assaulting her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to beat her.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them recognized that they maintained private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elida Doila will be "lightweight voice" in the Scottish Board of Lightweight
At the annual meeting of the Board of Eilid Doyle, the Executive Director was elected to the Scottish Executive Board.
Doila is Scotland's most award-winning space and outdoors lightball, and President Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to use her extensive experience at international level in the last ten years.
"Eilida is highly respected throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world in the light-platform community, and we are convinced that Scotland will easily get an enormous amount by engaging in its government," Betijs said.
Doila said, "I want to act as a "light voice" and I hope that I can really get involved and help drive this kind of sport into Scotland."
An American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, thus winning in general four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pandit, is unable to follow a transitional ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day of the month before, I experienced an stroke.
I couldn't go.
Doctors claimed that only time would show whether and to what extent I would improve.
It was a terrible job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I can already do business training!
Thank you for the inspirational words!"
Indications of breast milk pump advertising that compares mothers to cows
The breast milk pumping company has taken care of shared views online in relation to advertising where nursing mothers are compared to laying cows.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "world-wide silent-bearing breast pump" into circulation, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a lipstick advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance with a wall-filled cow kiss at a song whose words sound like this: "Yes, I've heard myself, but you don't see any bones" and "if you haven't seen them, they're not trimmings, they're my breasts."
The greeting continues: "Drive out, cast out, I feed the little ones, cast out, cast out, I praise my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the Facebook page of the company has called for a broad online resonance.
The 77 000 times and hundreds of times commented video have received shared viewer feedback, and many claim that it highlights the "shoots" of the milk industry in the light.
"The very wrong decision to use beef for the advertising of the product.
Just as we, they, to produce milk, have to become difficult and have to be born, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they were born," wrote one.
"Elvie" breast milk pump is not falling within the range of breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "The advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others advocated advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incentive".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had breast feed.
Milk withdrawal made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a great product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It is fun advertising, meant for mothers who remove the milk (non-working places or toilets) and feel like a cow.
It is not an advertising that celebrates or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovered that they all danced with the non-slip pumps placed in their breasts.
The concept of campaign is based on the observation that many women who break up their milk claim to feel like a cow.
But the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, it has no pipes and pipes, and it does not fall into the breast designed for nursing women, allowing them to move freely, hold babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarina (Anna Balarin) "Mother" partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a courageous and provocative placing on the market.
We wanted to draw attention to the elimination of milk, while at the same time showing in a fun and understandable way the sense of the disturbing freedom that the new pump will carry."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has come to the center of attention.
In London Modes, two children’s mothers showed up at the scene of Marta Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children's silences moved to a small town near the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has risen rapidly, although the borders are relatively large each month, as many people as before, and have achieved this in part by the precious rhetoric and policies of the Trampa administration, which have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Usually most sponsors have also been immigrants themselves without documents, fearing that openly refusing to accept a child will endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to allow fingerprints to be removed and these data would also be transferred to other immigration-related institutions.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior officer of immigration and customs law enforcement, before the Congress, testified that the agency had arrested ten people who had applied for non-adults.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or sponsors' household members are illegally staying here, and a large proportion of these people are criminals abroad.
That is why we continue to pursue such people," Mr Albens said.
According to the asylum officials, in an effort to speed up the examination of child cases, officials have introduced new rules which provide that some of them will have to be brought before the court within a month of detention rather than after 60 days, as provided for by the previous standard.
Many will use the videoconferencing call option rather than come in person to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for exemption will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they will become uneasy or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or escape attempts, the information provided by asylum workers and the evidence obtained from the system during the last months.
The lawyers argued that these concerns would be increased in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of suffering are more often seen because of their width.
They added that moving children to a tent city, without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to leave their friends, could lead to injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria forces the US, France and Turkey 'occupiers' to immediately execute their forces
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valids al-Moualem (Walid al-Moualem) also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was already running for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria by defending the fight against terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualems said that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "war against terrorism is almost over".
He stated that Damascus would continue to "fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed", cleansed from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States of America has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualems stated that the conditions were great for them to return, and he blamed the "separate Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears", which is why refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive help to rebuild the country before an agreement on the end of the war is reached between Asad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the last dumping ground in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russia's supported Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "is a certain deadline", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-related group "Jahbat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura (Staffan de Mistura) hopes to convene soon the new committees, including government and opposition representatives, first meetings to develop the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and to pave the way for elections.
Moualems laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to "the revision of the existing Constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Tramps will be selected for a second time
From this point of view, Mr Trampa will be re-elected in the 2020 election, unless, and possibly so, many liberal observers, impotentness and scandal will not put an end to his presidency.
And then "it will always be the most dramatic final of the Presidency!"
At present, there is no evidence of the release of observers.
Since 2014, ratings have been more than doubled in the CNN’s most favourable broadcasting time to reach 1,05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled to reach 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News is looking at 2.4 million viewers in the most favorable broadcasting time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen informs, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichelas Medovas show) is in the highest position on cable television rankings with 3.5 million main news viewers in the evening.
"It's a fire that attracts many people, because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama support.
Nellai Skovelai (Nell Scovell), comedy writer-veterane and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is his theory.
She remembers the trip by taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that I would vote for Mr. Trampa.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he mocks me,' said the novelist Skovela.
Chaos is to some extent entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the judgement of Rou against the Ways case, whether immigrant families can unite, and the situation of the global economy.
Ignoring is a beauty that can only be allowed by the most privileged observers.
And yet this is more than to be informed to the citizen when at six o'clock to look at the expert group's consultation, as Bob Woodward has used uncalled sources of information for his book Fair, Paul Manafort, $15,000 worth of bomber jackets from a stream of colors and skin ("the clothes from which it smells high," said "Washington Post") and the role that Stormy Daniels (Stormy Daniels) will play, to say, in the description of the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never understand Super Mario again as before.
"Part of what he does that creates the impression of reality show is that he rounds you every day with information," Brents Montgomery (Brent Montgomery), Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Pawn Stars" explained about the variable team of the Tramp show and the day-to-day trends (the N.F.L., the fame of Kim Čenuna).
You can't let go of any one episode because otherwise you'll stay.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss on Thursday, the time for the Kauis on the north coast (Kauai) was sunny,80 degrees (~27 after Celsia), but he sat in rooms where, without losing sight, he watched MSNBC broadcast while recording CNN.
He was unable to stand up even when Brett Caveno (Brett Kavanaugh) had to stand before the Senate Judicial Committee and his future in the Supreme Court threatened to be discussed.
"I remember the time when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "it's the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleys told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from abroad into the pre-election campaigns of the most pressing Parliament
No wonder that the 17th Congressional region of Pennsylvania is trying to obtain money thanks to the conversion of Congressional regions, which will result in two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently transformed locality of Pittsburgh is linked to the Democratic Representative of Connor Lamb, who obtained his place in another region in the spring of last year's special election.
Lembs will fight with another existing Member, the Republicans Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th area of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th area.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally distributed for the benefit of the Republicans, the maps were processed.
Competition in the new 17th area has led to the fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won a small victory in the March 18th session of the Congress in Pennsylvania.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide for a little over-the-counter for democrats.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for China's support, but then thought
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without great pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trampa had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners left behind the team of the management of the Trampa organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a "new decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", his department’s representative Hither Nauert (Heather Nauert) indicated in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were intended to apply only to Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars from America, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reducing financial assistance and limiting targeted visas, would be painful for the Central American country where the amount of unemployment and homicide has reached the highest level.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic well-being, followed by a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an effort to avoid the migration of migrants to the United States.
In mid-September, senior public officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the considerations of punishing Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice-President Mike Pence has now decided to take part in the conference scheduled for October to show how serious the administration stresses the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious statements or sentences on the part of Washington.
The White House representative, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to provide any further information on the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to enter into internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
Their story was confirmed by an external analyst approaching the administration, who also spoke with the condition that his anonymity would be maintained.
History study
The second stone garden could have been the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trampa may have delayed the justice of which the public has a lot of evidence.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party gets the upper hand at Congress, Trappam will have to respond to this structure and perhaps also to his fellow jury at the very moment when he is about to meet with the voters again.
There are many 'but', and I do not claim that the fall of Trappa is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are options that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to turn against Hitler, unless the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We got out and let go of the possibility of avoiding a blood alcohol that had been ingested for years.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trampa releases General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he secretly proposed to sign up to the president and thought about his inapplicability to the office.
Mr Rosenstein claims that the "The Times" story is not accurate.
"How do we answer if the FBI's inquiry into Bret Caveno is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed to be a judge of the Supreme Court in spite of his false testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And what is most important, will we vote on the interim vote of Congress, which is called the Trampus for responsibility?
If we do not endure all these trials, then democracy will be in the spirit of winter.
However, I believe that we will all succeed in responding to what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once threw into my missionary home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and was sent 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a toast.

"Rangers" star Graham Dorrans (Graham Dorran) feels optimistic about the fight against Vienna "Rapid"
"Rangers" will join in Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive undisputed games in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League G.
The road trauma did not allow the center's attacker Grem Dorans to re-enter the season games until the undisputed result with 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can enjoy it because Villallarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game to believe that we could make good progress, and we got this point.
We may have been able to reach them in the end, but in general, there is a noble result.
They were probably better in the first half of the day, but we were out in the second half of the day and were a better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they won a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was obviously hard, but now there are new colds that I would feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue our fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they are worried about their pension stocks
Although the respondents were well - informed about the care they wanted to receive, few had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they were not talking to a spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent replied that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can’t prepare your family for you if you don’t make your wishes known before.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your opportunities to provide long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid insurance policy with the amount of money to cover these costs or the provision of your property, the main thing for you to have money.
Draw up your legal documents. Avoid legal battles before they start.
Talk about the health issues of the authorized persons so that you are a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you fail to express them with your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial authority.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you fail to do so with your own strength.
And don’t forget to look at the details! Imagine that one of your parents is being taken to the hospital to get urgent help.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please indicate these facts in a written plan so that such a situation does not surprise you.
"And this is not only about finances, but also about who the doctor is," said Martin.

Take care to draw up such a plan."
A man has been shot several times with an air shot in Ilfracombe (Ilfracombe)
The man received several shots with an air rifle when he went home at night.
The 40-year-old sufferer was found in the Oxford Grove (Ilfracombe) park, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and chest.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, at least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday.
As a result of the decommissioned communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala (Dongala) area north of Pala and are close to an epicenter of an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Slaves:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the edge of the narrow lake on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived there in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is an area that stretches about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of the island of Slaves.
It is estimated that in 2017 there were 299 200 people living in the province-based administrative region.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic support of the Province of Central Sulavesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongal.
The production of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated Morovali (Morowali), on the other side of the Sulawesi.
As reported by the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, over the last 100 years, Pala and Dongal have suffered from tsunami several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
Cunami also gased over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismic active Pacific fire ring where earthquakes are regularly formed.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a severe earthquake in the western coast of the province of Acehas (Aceh) in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries on 26 December, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean Coast, more than half of which were in Aceh.
2005: a strong series of earthquakes took place at the end of March and early April in the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias (Nia) near the coasts of Sumatra.
In 2006, 6.8 magnitudes of the magnitude of the earthquake emerged from Java, Indonesia’s most inhabited islands, in the south, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-strong earthquake broke out near the city of Padang — capital cities of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentavai (Mentawai) islands on the coasts of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters of high tsunami waves that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: an earthquake near the ground hit the Paddy Jaya (Pidi Jaya) area in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as it reminded of the destruction that the 2004 earthquake and tsunamis have brought.
This time, the tsunamis did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes struck the island of Lomboku (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake broke down thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sara Peilina's oldest son was arrested after the charge of domestic violence
Treks Peilin (Track Palin), the eldest son of former Governors of Alaska and Vice-President Sara Peilin, has been arrested for having been charged with the attack.
According to the report by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested in suspicion of domestic violence and arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report on what she claimed had happened, he took her phone.
Peilin is detained in Mat-Su's Pre-trial Detention Authority and has a fixed $500 security deposit, reports KTUU.
He stood before the court on Saturday, when the question of whether to confess himself guilty was declared "not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three Class A violations that could result in a year-long prison sentence and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which can be punished with a long prison term and a 2000-dollar fine.
It is not the first time that charges are brought against Peilin in criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Tom Peilin.
Her mother, Sarah Peilina, summoned the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of delaying the report on domestic violence and of carrying weapons in a riot in connection with this incident.
Her friend claims he's going through it with a hole on his face.
In 2016, veterinary groups criticised Sarai Peilina for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, returning from the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes caused by tsunamis in Indonesia: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake rose close to the central part of Slaves, south-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
There is a video on the social networks that shows the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu, a town on the shores of the tsunami.
Federal prosecutors want to request a rare death sentence for a person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
The federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfillo Saifov (Sayfillo Saipov), who is suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As it is claimed, 30-year-old Saipov used Home Depot rental cars to attack the bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit the pedestrians and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "with intent" killed eight victims and "with intent" caused a serious injury, as mentioned in the statement of intention to request the death penalty submitted to the Court of Justice of the South York Region.
According to the court document, in the case of both of these complaints, the death penalty may be imposed.
During the weeks following the attack, the federal grand jury adopted an indictment article on the appeal of Saipova to 22 charges, covering eight counts of charges of murder for the purpose of extermination, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of abuse and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and a prior intention", the prosecutors explained, saying that Saipova's attack was "slow, cruel and inhuman".
"Saifillo Habibulajevičs Saipov (Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov) injured, damaged and caused losses to these people's families and friends: Diego Enrike Angelini (Diego Enrique Angelini), Nikolas Klíss (Nicholas Cleves), Anna-Lorija Decadat (Ann-Laure Decadt), Darrens Drake (Darren Drake), Ariel Elich (Ariel Erlij), Ernáns Feruchi (Hernan Ferruchi), Ernans Diego Mendoza (Hernan Diego Mendoza) and Alejandro Damjans Pagnocco (Alejan Damian Pagnucco), ".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutors of the South York District Court brought charges in a death sentence case.
Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug suppliers, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in the New York federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being accused of engaging in a conspiracy in the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The death penalty in the electric chair was executed on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, in the course of days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
According to the police, he informed the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the complaint article, Saipov told officials that he had been inspired to attack after viewing the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his room.
He has rejected the 22nd indictment.
David Patton (David Patton), one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said he was "just naturally dissatisfied" with the prosecution decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand a death penalty rather than to accept a confession in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only extend the current injury to all parties involved," Paton explained.
The Saipova defence team has previously called on prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party declares that the management of Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAIDŽELAM FARAZAM
Naijgel Farajs promised to "mobilize the people's army" at a conservative conference today during the protest.
A former British leader of the Independent Party said that politicians should feel Eurosceptic anger when one of the members of the Parliament of Terezá Meja suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative member Peter Bone (Peter Bone) announced to the march in Birmingham that Britain would have long gone if Mr. Faraz was the minister of Brexita.
However, the challenge that Mrs Mejs will face in trying to unite her opposing party was demonstrated by conservatives who supported the EU's stay and joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain his compromise plan on Britain and the European Union's future Chequers compromise, and to feel attacks on those who want to leave the EU, those who want to stay in the EU, and those who want to stay in the EU.
The public said that she would strive to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a negative reaction, and would make it possible for the Europeans and leborists to choose between her offer and "haosu".
Mr. Bouna at the Solihall (Solihull) meeting of the "Leave Means Leave" said that he wanted to throw out the "To Chuck Chequers" plan.
He proposed to make Mr. Faraz a fellow citizen and to entrust him with a conversation with Brussels.
"If he were to say, we would have already gone," Bones said.
Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must launch the May Plan!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not hesitate to be servants!
We want to adopt our laws in our country!"
Mr. Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit's supporter Andrea Jenkin also took part in the march, and the reporters said, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please answer from Chequers and start listening."
Turning to May, she added: "The Prime Ministers remain in their place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians in the camp should feel pressure if they were to fail to comply with the decision adopted in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – people – and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to transfer Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message, he emphatically added to the effort of the people: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to transfer Brexit, feel pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and we will never be relieved until we have achieved that we are independent, self-glorified, proud of the United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Palais promised to go through Birmingham before two hours ’ stay in the city center.
Unknown activists welcomed conservatives with Brexit banners after a group meeting this week.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, outlined the Conservatives on the security issues they experienced with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, an undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is approaching the title of the world championship after the team allows him to overcome Sebastian Fetel
From the time that Valter Botass qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the work of the Mercedes teams would play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Botass began well and almost left Hamilton in the drought, defending his position on the first two trips and invited Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first got in the garage and left Hamilton in the lurch to deal with the others, it was probably the decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled around later and retreated from Fetella, but Hamilton continued to stand up to the leaders after the adjustment of the forces that saw the Ferrari driver continually leave the inside free, risking leaving after the double maneuver to defend themselves in the third corner.
Max Versapens started from the back row and was the seventh on the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on the tires to reach the finish quickly and settle Kimi Rikonnen’s fourth.
Finally, he arrived in the garage at around 44, but unable to increase speed in the remaining eight circles, because Rikonen remained the fourth.
This is a difficult day because Valter did a fantastic job all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one or two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump praised Senator Diān Feinstein for her inability not to make public the letter of Christian Blessing Ford, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking in the House in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about Ford's testimony he gave to the Senate's Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "bad, random and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening during the last days in the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, mean, unwary and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak a document? "Oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, Senators intonation.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter explaining in detail what Forda accuses Kaveno, and in early September the letter was made public, but Feinstein denies that it would have happened in her office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, "I re-charged" her story, "Finestein told the commission," reported "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did."
But her refusal was not pleasing to the president, who said this situation in Saturday evening: "I will tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the High Court candidate, whose three women are charged with sexual harassment, the President proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are objectively determined to regain power through any means."
Whether you see evil, unhappiness, they don't care what they hurt what they have to destroy to gain power and control," says the president, "the media.

Air traffic controller dies allowing hundreds of people on the plane to escape during an earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself so that a plane with hundreds of passengers would safely get up from the ground.
More than 800 people have died, and many have lost their lives after a violent earthquake struck the island of Slaves on Friday, causing tsunamis.
The territory continues hard after harvest, and many are trapped in a double town of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues were saving their lives, 21 - year - old Antonius Ganavāns Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport, which was severely damaged.
He remained in his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, would probably be taken up in the air.
Then he stepped out of the traffic control station, thinking it might break.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesia’s air navigation agency, Johannes Siratis, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're heartbroken to hear it," he fills.
However, national authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the State Disaster Prevention Agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Botong) is limited.
"It is believed that there will be a beautiful increase, as many more bodies of people are under the rubble, as well as many cannot access," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The waves, reaching a height of six feet [6 m], destroyed Pala, where the massive barge will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old new mother, Sky News, said: "Just a minute ago, the emergency medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, International Red Cross leader in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is urgently helping the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived at the Pala and the state military deputy said: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out all the eviction tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has already been hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline took a flight during which it landed in the Pacific Ocean Bay in Micronesia and is now claiming that one of the people has died, although before it reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing aircraft.
Air Niugini reported on Saturday afternoon in the press release when they were unable to answer for one of the passengers — a man.
The airline reported that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped save other passengers and services after the plane landed in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
There are still unclear reasons for the accident and the sequence of events.
The air carrier and the U.S. Navy report that the aircraft landed in the bay shortly after the take-off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses seemed to have reassessed the length of the runway on the plane.
The American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Jens says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane using emergency exits because the water was only up to the vent.
He said that the Stuarts were panicking and crying and that he had a slight head injury.
Seafarers from the United States who worked nearby to improve the ship’s port also helped rescue operations using the inflatable vessel to deliver people on the coast about 30 metres (100 ft) below the water before the plane crashed.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last twenty years in PNG registered airlines, none of them related to "Air Niugini".
A psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events during the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution provided evidence in the case under review in which the man was accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Commenting on the psychoanalysis of the Department of Justice of the United States, Paul Rovlets testified for several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the swearers how he used the information he received from the phone to put together what the 29 - year - old defendant Quinton Telis and the 19 - year - old prisoner Jessica Chambers did on the night she died.
Rovlett said that he had received location data from several telephones that showed that Tel was with Chambers on the evening of her death, arguing about her previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday at the courthouse, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing because my car was in Nesville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlett said that shortly after the death of the Chamber, Telis would delete the shorts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He will wipe him out of his life," said Heil.
The defences are expected to provide their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the oathers later that same day.

It's black again!
In New York, a couple complained about dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York, the suspense accused a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a wrong message from the mother who complained that the suspense "is again black."
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the case to "pressuring".
Lindsia Plasco-Flaksman, the mother of two children, expressed her rejection of the fact that the new babysitter, Jizele Maurísa, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"Don't don't be, as long as MELNAIS," Plasco-Flaksman wrote to his husband in a short.
However, she sent a message, not to her husband, but to Maurice, twice.
By examining his inaction, the Plasco-Flaksman's resignation to Mauritius, pointing out that his previous afro-American who had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice has appealed to the court for compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with a secure residence, which she originally applied for, without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things do not," she said on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the accusation that they were racist, claiming that the termination of Mauritius’s employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that after her accusation, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, the man said "Post."
"But would you trust your children to someone you have been rude to, even if it was just because of a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
The Court of Justice's hearings as "pressurized", Plasko said that his wife had been born for only two months back and was in a very "complicated situation".
"Are you really looking at something like this?
It is not acceptable action," the investment banker added.
As long as judicial proceedings are still taking place, public opinion is quickly tried across social networks, condemning them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the editors of Paddington’s books were afraid that readers would not be able to associate with the speaker
Bond daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put yourself in some shoes", who reads the book for the first time before it was issued.
It's very surprising now to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
When she said that her father, who had worked for an operator BBC before he felt the inspiration to write a book for children about a small toy, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "sweet acid" after the father’s departure in the past year.
Speaking of Paddingon, whom she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted about his potential success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and he wasn't great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was just like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he saw Padington's success in a similar way.
Even though it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to leave my dying daughter on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter quickly was taken to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said that it is very bad and expected that she will not survive," Ednana-Laperuza said.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she would die within the next two minutes and I had to get rid of her.
And so did I.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly ended and left her body.
She would've died sooner and it's all over now.
I had to sit down and wait knowing that this was happening.
I could not get or cry because I would find myself in a situation where there are families and people around me.
I needed a lot of power to control myself."
In the end, then already facing the loss of her daughter, Ednana-Laperuza was on an airplane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I've nodded my head down and the tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but just during the flight, I felt deep compassion for Neda.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Embarrassing women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide act to help others not to take their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphrey strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
David’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydia, said that her son was a promising meal with a dependent smile.
"Everyone recognized her after a laugh.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted up" always and everywhere."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davida said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davida created the cards, "to let me know that there are people who can turn around and talk, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit quietly, you have to talk."
Hamphrey, who has been a member of David’s family for some 15 years, lost his partner, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he would feel sad or depressed or in any other way feel," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when children opened gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
Her death was a major injury to children, but they have to deal with it: "It brings together the whole family.
It separates us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Breta Caveno's future in the war because the FBI is launching an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he requires -- in a time- and volume-limited investigation -- we might be able to get a little consensus," Fleiks said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "shared" between the fixed partisan bill.
Why do the supporters of Caveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstinence is only coincidence.
Intervention is after five weeks, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to go bad, their efforts will be much weaker to elect a man from among them in the highest court.
George V. Bush called the senators, praising them to support Kaveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans, but 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pensam, Vice-President, to vote and approve them in the Supreme Court.
Kim's management "reducing" North Korea's number of asylum seekers
North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea have fallen since Kim Jong came back to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 applicants for political asylum compared to 2011, when the number was 2706.
Park said that stronger border controls of North Korea and China and high human smuggling rates are the main factors.
Pyongyang did not submit any public comments.
Most of the political asylum seekers from the end of North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and deported in a forced manner.
Relations between North and South Korea, still technically fighting, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation talks.
This took place after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Tramp and Kimu Yongung in Singapore, when they agreed to cooperate on large trains to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the progress made since these negotiations.
"If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and in such circumstances we will never be unilaterally armed first," Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nensia Pelosi calls Bret Caveno "histrian" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The head of the Chamber of Minority Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno a "histrian" and claimed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelos commented on Saturday's "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if the woman had acted like this, they would call her " hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to the testimony given to the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Caffeine emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment to Dr. Christiana Blezia Ford, when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the demonstrators on the Commission, calling their accusations about "the destruction of a fragile and coherent nature", organised by liberals who are angry that Hilaria Clintone lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos said she believed that the Caveno testimony was a reason he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with such claims and attitudes with which he is addressing Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelos objected when he asked her if she would try to question Caveno if she would approve it and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so -- if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only fit for office in the Supreme Court, but also for work in the existing court," said Pelosi.
Kaveno, now, is a judge in Washington County Court of Appeal.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about the possibility that Kaveno would take decisions against the "Affordable Care Act" or Roe v. Ways, because he considered him a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno examined questions as to whether he would reject the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and two-way man to work in court, but we would expect that we would be happy to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'," said Pelosi.
But women need to keep their hands on each other.
It's the denunciation, months and years it's all gone "by the side", but she's not allowed to get it all out of her crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once I was very helped by a woman who was the head of a company, who said that she also wept when she was angry, but created a technique — when she became angry and started to cry, her person who was talking to her said, "You may think I was grieving because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
The type of anger discharge of the Asherites is recognised only in part because they are translucent on the basis of their own.
One of my most vivid memories is from the older job, which was the men’s share, when I once cried because of the unexpressed anger, when my older woman, a distraught manager (the woman), always a little frightened, took me to the stairs.
"Never let them see that cry!" she said to me.
"They don't know that you've been transferred.
They think you're awake, and they're just happy that you were able to "fall under the skin."
Patrija Schroeder, then a Congressman of the U.S. Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gerry Harta at his election as president of the campaign.
In 1987, when Harts, who was engaged in extramarital relations, left the ship, also called "the making of fools" and left the election, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for the president's office.
"It wasn't a careful decision," she laughed and told me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to have another.
There were those who called it "Snow White and Seven Ridings."
She took part in the campaign, backed up her fundraising and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that many of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to the male representatives, had donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, broke up into a system that made it very difficult to collect money and voter rather than to speak to delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "smacked".
"You'd think I had a nerve breakdown," recalled Schroeder, as the press responded to him.
"You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my hat.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing
The main arguments about how the US-China trade war began are hidden and until the fighting ends, disagreements between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, imposing a tax on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week with new rates affecting the unit's value of $200 billion (150 billion) and immediately placing half of the goods exported from the USA from China.
Beijing also responds to "welcomes" every time, the latest is five to ten percent of the $60 billion interest rate for American goods.
China has announced its commitment to respond to the US alone and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be reduced.
To withdraw from Washington, certain requirements should be agreed upon, but public worship in the United States would be too overwhelming for Chinese President Xi Shi Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision has been taken either in Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any country that are really more dangerous than those previously recognised by observers," said New American Security researcher, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria claims to be ready for the return of refugees voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild a country that has suffered war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualems said the country's circumstances are improving.
"Now the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The United Nations assumes that since the beginning of the war in 2011, the country has left 5.5 million Syrians.
Another six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that helped to sponsor the riots.
European golf selection sensational victory in the Raider fight in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Rieder Cup in the US match with a result of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe recovered the cage when the team led by Tomas Bjorn acquired 14.5 points needed to intercept the U.S. sample.
The U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the whole tournament, threw his T-shirt into the water at PAR 3 at the 16th floor, entering the match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever succeeded in winning the 5-0-0 result since 1979 when the tournament is played in an existing format.
The American Jordan Spitts lost five to four sensational European teams, after ranking the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Jan. Polter from England, for which this was probably the last chance of Raider.
Eight Rider's team veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the best player from Europe all the time with 25.5 career points.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't control tears."
This was a tough year.
From my heart, I am grateful to Thomas for raising me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cage.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European election victory.
He further gives the name to his nation, John Rama, who won the US Gulf Legend of the Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 against 1 games.
"The pride I felt when I won the Tiger Woods, I grew up following this player's footsteps," said 23-year-old Rams.
Woods lost all his four cats in France and now he has a career entry with 13-21-3 in the Raider cage.
Uncorrected statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14th level golf tournaments are the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all week to find their opportunities, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
The U.S. select captain Jim Furik said after his team's disgruntled performance, "I was proud of the guys, they were fighting.
This morning there was a time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will be restructured, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must wear your shoes.
He beat us."
