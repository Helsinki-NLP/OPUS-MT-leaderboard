They don't make any trouble because they live five floors above us.
Don't you worry about your signs?
Sunday's the last day of the week.
Don't make me better than I am.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

I won't let them marry my dog.
I won't let you go there unless Tom comes with you.
I won't let Tom marry my sister.
No, I'm not afraid of ghosts.

Don't throw it at me.
I wouldn't throw it at Tom.
No matter how you do it, the result will be the same.
The accident happened because of Tom's carelessness.
The accident caused a traffic jam.
Don't play with her feelings.
I don't play the chimbal as well as I played.
Somehow I was inspired.
We haven't seen you in a while.
Some man.
Some Sioux gave that old trapper a gold nugget.
She first met him in Boston.

The most important thing is health.
Not when I'm standing next to you.
He didn't eat for two days.
Not only does Tom have to study, but so do I.

According to the Tatoeby directive, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language or translate them from a language that they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose natural and familiar sentences in their native language. When writing in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate the phrase only if you know for sure what it means.

I'm not paying for this.
Tom's gonna punish you for this.
I can't talk about Tom's behavior.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
For Tom's mistakes, the whole group was punished.
I love you for that.
I'm not paid for this.
In three months, Tom was dead.
They paid me five dollars for that bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back for something later.
I'll call you back for something later.
He'll call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call rescue!
They locked Tom in the store so he can't get away.
I closed the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I've closed all six windows.
Close your book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Close the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We'll sing another song.
I rang the bell and waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The arms industry brings benefits, but also suffering.
We've got the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What's the butter made from?
I don't entirely agree to be treated like this.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
She seemed to be shut up.
I thought I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I thought I'd changed my job.
I thought it was a chip.
I felt like a friend of my workmate.
I thought about Tatoebe.
I thought it was this day.
It seemed to me about Tom getting up from the dead.
The officer seemed to be afraid of their revenge.
Looks like Tom didn't notice Mary was there.
It seemed Tom has everything he needs.
It seemed Tom doesn't understand any of what you told him.
It didn't seem like Tom was alone.
He seems to be very sleepy.
I think Tom's responsible for Mary's nervous breakdown.
It seems too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
Looks like spring's coming too soon.
It seems like I'm still asleep during the day, but it looks like I can't sleep at all at night.
Looks like I've done it all for free.
Looks like you're happy.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
No one seems to understand me.
No one seems to understand me.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
Looks like he's made a lot of money.
No one seems to have noticed anything.
Looks like the war's not over yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do this.
Looks like Tom's cool.
It seems Tom trusts as much as possible less people.
Looks like Tom's got a problem whether it's gonna happen or not.
Looks like Tom's telling the truth.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember any of us.
Looks like Tom was asleep.
Looks like Tom's lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
Looks like he's losing his motivation.
Here's a picture of my school.
We need to use the connector here.
We left home early in the morning.
I'm going to be able to get her on this topic.
I think Tom might ask for help.
Health relations develop freely.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
She's keeping her from work.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
Which airport am I leaving?
Which one of those glasses did you drink?
The green's gonna bite you.

She died at the age of 54.
He's dead.
They died in battle.
He died ten years ago.
The woman you married is very beautiful.
My wife left me in October.
The woman denied everything.
Women must feel that they have the opportunity to do whatever work they want.
Women don't care about him.
Women like tea.
Women don't care about him.
I asked him if he'd hurt my back.
She asked me if I was okay.
She asked me if I knew this woman personally.
They asked if they were going to write a new dictionary.
They asked Tom if he felt safe with them.
I asked them where the train station is.
I asked Tom where he went.
I asked Tom where to put him.
He asked if he was coming.
He asked if he was coming.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He made a sound, so everyone heard it.
He made a little radio.
He grew old, he became confused and divorced, but he also grew rich and became famous.
He tried hard not to think of her anymore.
I didn't like him at first.
Turn it off, please.
Get out of here!
Jubla.
We live alone.
We've been living in this town since 1960.
Do you like living here?
She's living in comfort.

The life of the banker is hard.
Life is a riddle, and love is the answer.
Life is like a soap bubble.
Life is beautiful!
Life is nice.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
Life is hard and difficult.
Life is wonderful.
Life is a lot of suffering.
Life is not easy.
Life is not just about work.
Life will go on normally.
Life doesn't always evolve as you would like.
He's living in fame.
Where are Marco and Maria from? Maria and Marco are from Rome.
What chapter is this verse from?
Find out where Tom was going.

We've found out where he lives.
Did we find out who the woman is?
Did you find out where Tom was going?
I found out the food is a little sharp.
I found out my bike was gone.
Did you find out how much Tom is?
When she got off the bus, she got so bad that she started to throw away.
You let me down.
You let Tom down.
Who are you afraid of?
Make sure you didn't forget anything.
Check it out for me, please.
I've tried everything.
I've tried everything.
Son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried it herself.
I've tried everything.
He tried to attract her attention.
I'll try to do something about it.
Try to have a little compassion.
Try not to be stupid.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
Try not to read it that much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.
Try it again.
The evil witch of the man swore and turned into a wreck.
Gold is precious metal.
Gold is heavier than silver.
Gold is heavier than iron.
Evil people will be arrested and sentenced for their crimes.
She hurt him.
I'm mad at Tom.
The criminals managed to escape.
Criminal Tom stepped out and killed.
You broke your leg.
He changed the address.
Did I miss something?
For my part, it's not exaggerated.
She disappeared in the dark.
He's gone without a foot.
He disappeared in the dust.
He disappeared from the surface of the earth.
Get out of here!
Kill it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Knowledge of itself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I know him, and that's why I don't trust him.
I know him very well because I've often seen him in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the real reason why you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your younger brother very well.
Rape is a terrible crime.

Does anyone know this guy?
He knows the wine.

Suddenly the captain left the ship.
She abused my ignorance.
They're abusing me.
You abuse your authority.
Destroy your enemies. Make your friends out of them.
You'll be happy again.
I told them again to shut down the radio.
I'll read it again.
The snow fell from the sky with rain.
Juggling is another thing that I'm not very good at.
Pack it.
They sing in the congregation.
She sang a song. She's laughing at me.
At first, she didn't attract me.
A cat came under the writing table.
Two guys came out of the room.
The report of Tom's death left me confused.
I've made him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me.
The mature apple fell out of the tree.
I got hurt.
The mirror is rusty.
The mirror is sealed.
The mirror's broken.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd destroy all the corpses if I could.
You cancelled the meeting.
Cancel the advice.
You're gonna cancel the meeting.
She's rubbed her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from that book.
You're out of your mind.
I wouldn't make fun of that.
Tom's a man now.
It's wasting time.
The loss of the job she loved so much was a wound to her.
We've lost all our equipment.
He lost her.
I lost the rain that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the rain that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You lost your head, didn't you?

You're wasting your time.
Losing a job that she loved so much was a serious wound to her.
She stabbed the knife.
They took part.
I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We're still quiet.
Stay home.
Are you gonna stay or are you gonna leave?
Are you gonna stay or are you gonna leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the motel.
I'm staying with you.
The curiosity has won me over.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We'll call you.
We can do better.
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it on your own?
Can you handle it yourself?
I chose the path of least resistance.
My phone's ringing!
The bells went off.
The bells started ringing.
They're talking about it.
I turned my ankle.
We're used to everything.
I'm used to it.
The habit is second nature.
I used to live alone.
I'm used to winning.
He's used to not having a hot meal every day.
You'll get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
