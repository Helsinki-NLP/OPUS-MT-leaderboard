Number of trainees from Ukraine to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Police of the self-declared Lugan People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass in winter 2018-2019.
According to him, thus, Kiev plans to “make some sort of doubly complete the units”.
"Ukraine citizens' unwillingness to serve in the lines of Ukraine's U.S.A., mass dismissals have led to a low number of units," said Maročko, quoted as "RIA News".
He also did not rule out that real figures for the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO), which was later changed to a Joint Force (JO) operation.
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian rapesters in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DNR Alexander Zachenko.
The authorities of the D.N.R. classified what happened as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the investigation of the criminal case.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special services.
The U.S. authorities have forced Mask to leave the post of President of the Tesla Government
The American businessman, Ilon Mask, will leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla based on the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the department allows Mask to remain in the lead post in Tesla.
However, it is required to pay $20 million and to leave the post of chairman of the Board of Directors for 45 days from the date of the agreement and for no less than three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clear that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it was known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders with a statement of sufficient funds to redeem the company ' s shares and had brought it to court.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla's shares for $420 per item, but he didn't.
After Twitter, the company's shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDI compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, Jeremy Hunt, compared the Euro Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being a prisoner of the member countries of the Community.
The diplomat made such a statement at a meeting of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU out of prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only one who wants to escape the prison," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the EU would only exacerbate the crisis, notes "Gazeta.ru".
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated that Brexit ' s negotiations had come to an end.
So she commented on the outcome of the informal Euro-Union summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following the referendum.
The United Kingdom is expected to exit by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

In August, Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and cell phone number of the suspected user in terrorism when receiving the relevant judgment.
Telegram's audience after blocking to RF has decreased by 1.2 million

Ilon Mask is forced to leave the post of Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Mask have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the telechannel, the agreement reached by the Mask will require the post of Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
The commission allowed Mask to retain the post of Head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
They'll take the same amount with Tesla.
In this way, money is distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who lists the 50 richest people on the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX space corporation, Neuroteological company Neurolink and the Tesla electrician developer, and the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously brought Tesla Ilon Mask's Director General to trial because of his statement published on Twitter about the possible redemption of the company.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on a fixed-price stock exchange of $420.
The cost of a $420 share was allegedly “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture”, Bloomberg reported earlier with reference to the co-director of the Security Division of the Commission, Stephen Beijing.
However, Ilon Mask subsequently gave up his plans to buy shares.
Commenting on the claim made by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against him, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Purity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," said a businessman in a CNBC interview.
In August, Tesla’s group of shareholders filed a collective claim against Masca with a view to financial losses.
The complainants claimed that the businessmen’s posts had caused them harm.
In particular, one shareholder stated that tweets of businessmen were misleading, so Tesla shareholders were forced to buy paper at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the unwarranted statements of Ilon Mask led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilon Maska accused even the head of the Citron Research research company of stock exchanges.
However, if Mask had not been able to settle its dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with a removal from company leadership and even prison.
In particular, the former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission stated this to the CNBC television channel.
The mask is a bad guy who can't run a car company.

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the age of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming the world glory and made it the Nobel laureate.

Trump told us about "in love" in Kim Chen Yin
From the mutual cruelty of U.S. leaders and the CNDR, Donald Trump was joking.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was a successful joke about his success at the North Korean crisis resolution front.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now made so much peace that it is hardly in love with each other, the American President noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had taken the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that the Barack Obama team had so much to do with the CNDR that it could not even call the country's leadership - they simply didn't shoot the tube there.
At that time, the United States and the United States were at the threshold of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “pretty letters”, said Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also " cruel" to Kim Chen Yn, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved to such an extent that the leaders have “in love with each other”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile tests by Phenyan, as well as the closure of military sites.
All of this is the work of his administration, guaranteed by the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump approached Kim Chen IYne from the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps taken to descale tension.
However, Trump noted that sanctions against the CNDR would remain pending the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The meeting resulted in the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the CNDR, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remnants of US soldiers.
However, other practical steps have been taken to denuclearize North Korea so far.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had already been sent to the CDC since the Singapore United States Summit, but Phenyan rejected them, calling them gangsters.

Nice called for the "Moscow language by Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's novelist and cleaner Larissa Nice urged Ukraine to press "Russian Moscow product and Moscow language".
To do this, it offers Ukrainian product, “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
In his views on “the purpose of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine”, Nice shared it with the Ukrainian edition of “Observator”.
According to her, the Ukrainian product in question is now ready - it is even now and continues to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians are "relieved" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, it said that the Russian language had been widely used on television and radio before, but that it had practically not remained in public space.
However, in Nice’s view, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, only “the extension of borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Previously, Nice had shared experiences of maintaining the Ukrainian-language regime in a child camp in Carpathian, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons bookstores, one of which was contacted by the court in Russia.
When she didn't make it, Nicky slammed into the girl's hand.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called a "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger was not even avoided by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the staff talk to each other in Russian, she did a scandal and left, banging the door.
A man’s conversation was interrupted, and this led to his own fruit.
Urala Protector Denis Kulakov is a victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the ninth round match of the Russian champion.
"Dennis, what do you think made it possible to win?"
"I think we wanted to win more," says Kulakov's official Ural website.
"This complicated game was achieved, a serious man conversation took place during the break, and it brought fruit: killed two balls and didn't miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did he feel today?"
"If he took 90 minutes, then it's okay!
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a little bit of force to keep nothing going.
And yes, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevic Hashnev brought me to this game, and thank them so much!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery, and the mood in the community is good.
Now we had a white band, although it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice with the sick."
"Did you miss the game when you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's not much to worry about, because it's really a bad situation.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
The main thing is that we won and advised the sick.
And the rest is secondary."

The Head of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs of Constantine Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not exclude it from being a turning point in the perception of the RF as an integral part of the solution to global world problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more intimidating,” said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the RF was “described as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola's disease, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which was sufficiently unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, he stressed that “the subject of Russia was virtually absent in the negative. ”
"If you carefully examine the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not now taking Ukraine, Georgia or the British, but people were not quite right," said the politician, noting that Russia “was not the biggest wall that was trained by tennis ball attacks.”
The head of the Sopheda Profile Committee does not rule out that this is evidence of a trend that he believes would “offend the current [UN General Assembly] session, although this trend may occur in two or three years.”
“I do not rule out that the current session can be reversed in any sense”, Kosachev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia's involvement in international affairs has made progress.”
As an example, he brought situations to Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So long as this is not Ukraine, unfortunately, but I do not doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be exhausted in time," the parliamentary said.
This is related to what he believes is “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible, inseparable participant in addressing global contemporary problems”.
"I don't want to go wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement is no longer going back, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another “interested and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how modern peace should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the Assembly] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, and I had held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian view of the world, in large measure, did not interest anyone, the situation was different now,” said the Chairman of the Committee of Soviets.
In his view, this is because “a so-called new liberal order, which faces the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration”.
“And the demand for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident here,” said Kosachev, stressing that he believes in this sense that “the current session is a successful session for the work of a Russian delegation that is successful for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that Idlib will not have to use military force in the Syrian province, says the head of the MIDI of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the expulsion of Russian-banned combatants from the demilitarized area of Idliba, reports the RIA News.
The chapter of MIDI also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of Eufrat in the event of a desire for Kurds to separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that the negotiations by the Kurdish forces of SDF were good until the United States had stopped.
On 17 September Putin and President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone by 15 October along the line of military opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Earlier it was reported that a 37-year-old defender had been negotiating the transition to Moscow's Spartacus.
According to RT with reference to Mirror, former British congregator John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known game, which has lasted for a long time at the London Club, will lead the team for not more than 23 years.
It is noted that at Terry's training station, Jodi Morris will be replaced by Derby County.
Remember, in September Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but finally he gave up this idea after talking to the family.
The first spokesperson of the Supreme Council of Irina Geraštenko apologized to the convicts in the RF for "spionage" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suštenko for not being able to get rid of the wall.
She said this in a video to a police prisoner who had been recorded before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of the FSB.
She said that during those days, under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there was an action that the participants announced a hunger protest demanding the release of Kremlin's followers.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural actors, including people who know you well, are starving, supporting Oleg Senzov, other police prisoners, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand -- the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all police prisoners of Kremlin and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," said Gerashtenko.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would be carried out by every Ukrainian, making us “bader, stronger in the protection of Ukraine’s national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding that it is good and that it is evil”.
Remember, the correspondent of Ukrinforma in France, Roman Sustenko, was detained by Russian forces at Moscow Airport on September 30, 2016.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage to the Chief Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sustenko to 12 years of a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized the verdict as legitimate.
Russian prisoners met the last request of the Ukrainian prior to his colonization.

"I couldn't even hold the bed"
Kikabidi’s Watch Tower on Cancer Control
Many artists now relate how they have coped with oncology.
Unfortunately, sickness does not spare anyone, but the history of popular people about victory over cancer gives hope to many sick ones.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabidi admitted that he only lived through his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible illness that sounded like a sentence.
"I'm as if a mole came down on my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They're in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the bed there, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
The beginnings of the analysis have turned out to be bad, the artery doesn't get blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big dirty tank in my head, they made an emergency operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw a hole in the chest," Kikabide said in the once-in-a-life program.
The plague has turned out to be a crime.
At that time, 37 years ago, the Tbilisi people even came to say good - bye to his house.
But the actress’s wife did not allow the live actor to be kept alive, she believed that she could cope with the illness and that she had not left the bed of her beloved wife for more than a year.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be in the living right now.
Every time I had a critical situation, she was close, like a rock," said an actor.
The actor managed to cope with the illness, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he rejects hearings about his illness, about the endless endings that appear in the Network.
The founders of the website "Americac" have introduced the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Cijarto to the "Purity" section.
The reason was “the temptation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the neighboring MID head has identified “direct threats of invasion in Ukraine” and “support for separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as the “organization of provocation aimed at the mass violation of Ukrainian citizens’ legislation”.
We note that in front of Sierra Leone, the deputy of the Kiev-Pecher Lavry Pavel and the representative of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) of Onufria were hired at the Cleanhouse.
They were opposed to receiving Thomas the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, Ukrainian President Petr Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the sum of the gold parachutist's warlock.
At the same time, 23 salaries were paid to the Deputy Governor of the Vronez Region, Yuri Agibalov, under the Regional State Posts Act.
However, the actual amount of "golden parachutist" released from office by the officer was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the regional Government ' s press service.
Under the law, the salary of Agibalova is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the amount of one-time payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, rather than 1 million rubles written by the media.
The officer has received an old-age pension since July 2018.
Its public office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and the simultaneous payment shall take place immediately after the dismissal of the post, explained to the agency “RIA Novosti” in the Government area.
At the same time, Agibalov's pension benefits were suspended when he was appointed and his salary did not change compared with the previous period.
The winner of the governor ' s election was the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was released from office due to the expiry of the term of office of the head of the area.
The powers of other officials in the region were similarly terminated.
On 29 September, the Telegram channel Nezigarj published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had retired from the post of Vice-Governor, had paid an exit allowance of 23 salaries, and two days later he received a similar post without the addition of the Vrio.
Member of the House called on students to tell them about the damage of masturbation
The Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee is responsible for the work of the First Vice-Chairman.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents to masturbation caused the harmful information they found on the Internet.
It is up to educational institutions and families to combat this, added the MP.
Gennady Neištenenko, MP of the RF (in an interview with the Moscow-speaking radio station):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this is to be done by explaining the loss, as there is a risk of sexual health for both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the conception of children occurs early enough, and there are still large gaps between their sexual conception and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
In the view of Neištenko, the problem is hampered by “growth”, the reduction of “sex age” and the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are faced with ononysm.
The MP believes that teaching about the harm of Onanism is primarily about the schools of “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we just won't get along with you, easy to talk," said the professor.
Gennady Neištenko is an active scholar of the RAMN, a member of the Bureau of the RAMN, a doctor of medical science, professor.
Dr. Russia and Kyrgyz, member of the presidency of the Russian General Public Organization, the League of Health of the Nation.

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant alternative to Germany is a regular record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
According to all, the inhabitants of Germany began to take seriously the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which made the country a leading goal for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, the latest so-called issues suggest that the anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" party is becoming increasingly popular and the position of the ruling Merkel and Zeihofer bloc is weakened.
This week, ADG took a regular record, rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathies.
Right-wing Conservatives with 17 per cent popularity have been able to bypass social democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be written down as a statistical error, but it cannot be noted that the fact that the ADG, established in 2013, from a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has been able to become a major political force.
Leadership in general has so far continued to hold the ruling HSS/HDS unit, which has about 30 per cent.
However, the trend towards loss of points is evident here: in April, Angela Merkel's support for the block was four percentage points above.
The German chancellor ' s personal rating, which is headed by the Government of Germany, is also reduced.
Today, there are 48 per cent of Germans in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, the Social Democrats were followed by green (15 per cent), left (11%) and Liberal (10 per cent).
Evolution of Alternatives
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Election 2013" group, which included members of the Christian-Democracy Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but at the outset it was only dealing with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
The group was opposed to "sponsoring" Germany's weak economies in the EU, and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country's full exit from the EU.
In the light of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a fully-fledged party that occupied the Eurosceptic network and began to strongly criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was allowed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" took place in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens "Bolvanian Nation"
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books Ostap Drozdov in the direct atmosphere, acknowledged that he considered his compatriots “a Bolwan nation”.
They believe in television, and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We haven't had a culture of reading and accepting texts since we were kids," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio of the Independent began to fight the literature containing the smallest signs of criticism from the Kiev authorities, banning the import of up to 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car in the case of apocalypsis - a magazine behind the wheel
Buying this car can be anything you want.
The company Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it had already accepted applications for its new armory.
Bronvik Apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
The issue of apocalypsis of money is not only made by video games, movie shows and book publishing.
Now new ones are also taking advantage of car companies.
Yes, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its apocalyptic defender Senator APC.
In a time of imagination, the company's engineers create armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is composed of 12 passengers, who are located in a fully-fledged bronchodilator without special comfort.
This bunker, or else you'll not call the structure, because the level of defense is in accordance with standard B7, set to a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its work, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from shells and anti-personnel mines.
Salon defense of the Apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
In order not to harm passengers even the explosive wave from the crashing car, the car salon is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and ignition system.
For a safe view, the Rossel Senator APC car is equipped with a night vision camera system as well as a visionary armoured tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the Apocalypse's apocalyptic parlor, Roshel Senator APC
In order not to impact the gravity of the armoured car on its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbo-powered turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, whose full power is transferred to four armored wheels through a 6-degree automatic transmission box.
There's no way I'm going to put you in a completely defense of apocalyptic Rossel Senator APC.
You can see Roshel Senator APC's armory at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will take place in October.
Named after the Time of Death of the Universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, and the world is about 13.8 billion years old at the age of ten times the age of the world.
The study of the international scientific community is published in the Library of Electronic Preprints arXiv.org and is published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings have been made by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of the world ' s energy mass, scientists, working in the L Cold Dark Matter standard space model, assessed the rate of expansion of the Universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
Subaru's press release notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on the LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new evidence that the world would cease its existence after 22 billion years as a result of the Great War.
A regular attempt has failed to bring together pension referendum promoters
The public's view of pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow, a general referendum group against retirement was held on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that had registered different formulations of issues (five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CIC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians: "Are you in favour of not increasing the age of the pension provided by the pension law as at 1 July 2018, on which Russian citizens are entitled to an old age pension?"
This language was registered by a weekly sub-group whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but considered it to be simple and legal.
The majority of the members of the meeting were members of the member Ili Sviridova (six subgroups) and CRC (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups from Lower New York, Vronez and Orenburg joined them.
Earlier, Sviridov had told the News that invitations had been sent to all initiators and that some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, the head of the summer sub-group, which was supported by another 15 sub-groups, said to the News that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was the other and who was the enemy."
Death of the blue singer Otis Rash

The rival was a worthy warrior, causing us great problems.
I'm glad we played well today.
I've already said that once the naked will come, the main thing is to work on it.
And that we have won very important too."

In the sword "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbine's errors fell asleep, as from the horns of abundance
The former judge of the Allied category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Evgeni Turbin in the 9th round of the Russian Locomotive Championship, Ahmat, and discovered the controversial episodes of the game.
How do you judge Evgenia Turbina in the Locomotive match, Ahmad?
- I believe that the arbitrator confirmed his inability to judge the Russian Prime Minister.
I am surprised that the efforts made at the fifth Spartacus tour, Dinom, neither Turbin himself nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private missteps of rough receptions fell out of the corner of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's train, he's going down with his hands in his criminal court defenser Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the door, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, who was at the 82nd minute when it turned out that the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was an intentional defense game here in his courtroom.
The turbine was next to the moment, and the episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, the three were all gone, and the penalties were not appointed.
Thus, the match account has been broken, and sports justice has been washed.
That was the same case when the Court of Justice interpreted and buried the sporting spirit of the games.
- At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who violated the rules against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he was given a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Should've shown the second gorilla?
- Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up at the moment.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice that some teams were being penalized for violations such as those in the episode with Idova and none.
What do you value the words of the football player?
- See what you can understand under double standards.
There were criminals.
They didn't give it to him.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second penalty in the opposite gates.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
Here's where he played Locomotive on Saturday and Ahmata has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the charges of rape by Judge Kavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate at the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on NBC TV.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavano at hearings in the rape senate.
The candidate at the U.S. Supreme Court had earlier drawn attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Yes, Cavano repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but he said that he never drank before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments are also played by Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, the drunkest virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in execution of Matt Damon.
Previously, Cavano was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbara Straizand has found some strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
The American singer Barbara Straizand said that her dead dog’s clones were acting completely different from the original pimp.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like she, but it's not possible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Straizand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a cotton-de-tuller named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua-born dog called Cudo Milly (Miracle Milly) called the smallest dog in the world was cloned at 49 times.
Specialists are working on cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
United States of America thought of Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supply
In the United States, Russia ' s maritime blockade can be launched to gain the advantage of the world ' s energy market.
The US authorities have been so eager to fight for the success of the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia ' s maritime blockade, which remains one of the world ' s leading energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Navy, told us about the possibility of a maritime blockade.
In contrast to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior is not a police officer, but a civilian officer, including a natural resource policy.
Zinke ' s statement was therefore fully within the competence of the Office headed by him, even though it had not been deprived of political adornment.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the U.S. military forces were controlling sea routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion's share of its income from the world market for oil and gas.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main reason why Moscow was revitalized in the region, Zinke was convinced.
The Minister suggested that the United States was still counting on itself to lead the world's energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to crush Russia and Iran, and the maritime embargo on trade routes, which is an acceptable measure in this direction, is considered by Zinke.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of the Russian Gonka
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and Constituent England John Terry -- about why he visited Russia's 9th Tour Championship Spartacus -- "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia I have a club that I follow.
I've been following him quite recently and I've been interested in looking at him.
I can't say that I'm a patient, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision," says Terry, Chelsea's patient website.
Remember, Rostov with 18 points was raised to the third place in the tournament table, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line with 15 points in the asset.
On the next tour, on 7 October, the Red and White will play with Enisem, and the Valerie Carpina will host Orenburg the day before.
The expensive violin was put in the lobby for nothing.
When in the city of Sommerville (Massachoustes) the LBC Boutique and Loan man brought a violin, the Lambard worker offered only 50 dollars for an old and unrepresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan Mcdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from the expert.
Here it was found that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinand Galiano and was valued at $250,000.
Only one scrap of violin is estimated at $16,000 to $16,000.
The investigation found that the violin was not so long stolen from one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
While it is not yet known how the violin got to the man who put it in the lombard, there are no past encounters with the law.
The manager said that all those who now had a lombard violin would ask to play on it to make sure that it really belonged to a client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we expect an overwhelming opposition: Spartacus will take to his Tushina "Rostov" stadium under the leadership of Valeria Karpin - a human being, as we know, not a foreign "national team".
The special spicyness of this meeting adds that clubs now have an equal number of points -- 15 and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-reaching Zenita and in one spot from Krasnodar, which is playing with Dinam tomorrow.
In the red and white fields, the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, and in the League of Europe, the team of Massimo Carrera came suddenly to the Rapido, and recently entered the house of Ahmatou.
After a fair trial with the CSCA, Spartacus with a minimum account and not without work played the Black Sea in Cuba, and it was early to talk about whether Russia's most popular club had approached the end of the crisis.
The "Rostov" three matches couldn't win in a row, so the defeat doesn't even know five players.
Let's see if Carpino can extend the no-brained series so basic to himself as a match.
The previous Karpin "Rostov" meeting with Spartacus ended in favor of the capital team.
Start at 7:00.

On the International Translator ' s Day, 30 September, a professional translator, Berbel Saxe, told of this.

The evening school comedy is headed by the U.S. Box Office
The evening school comedy debuted in American theaters last Friday earned $28 million for its first weekend in the paper.
This resulted in an unimaginable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish leading the U.S. box office in 28-30 September.
On the international market, the film, until only 20 countries, has collected $5.5 million, including 2 million of British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which is remarkable enough, has surpassed the second novel of the West Bank -- the Multís Smolfut -- an curious story of the knowledge of a promising Yeti with a representative of the human race, whose main hero never believed in.
The project of directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million for their initial outputs, generally justified the expectations of experts forecasting 20-25 million a week.
With regard to the Summaries of Smallfoot, they currently amount to $38.6 million (with it already in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active in the film, which had a fine of 3.6 million.

In his second week, John Bellers' screenplay with the charming Jack Black with Kate Blancett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide collection to $53.8 million.

In his first childhood as a well-known installer (and from a recent director) Gregor Platkin, who had previously worked in a number of large horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", where "Hallfest" places are very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
In view of the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh became "Sensely Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to be not thinking of coming out of top-10 American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as a result of September, is the sixth in the ranking of the sex cassette tapes for the whole story with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is exactly the amount of the picture that has been working on the internal market for the time being, and the total output of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three happy people who have been in the U.S. rally for 28-30 September, they have become the Hitchhiker, the White Rick Boy, and the... the Badger Target, who have earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million last weekend respectively.
In addition, in the next coming out of the U.S., he will gather a long-standing Vienna with Tom Hardy, who, without a doubt, will lead the U.S. Box office as a result of the first October.

"College talked about Siberian patients, and I want to point out our patients," says Belova's official Vitenza website.
"I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
By the game, it must have been the Lord who helped the Siberians today, because they had made a very rough mistake, especially our leaders.
We lost the micro-game 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to pull this match, even though there were moments.
But I'll still blame myself.
Because they seem to have missed something in preparation.
It was a second team compared to the previous match."
"It's a stupid piece of shit."
The viewers are upset by Agutin's election to the Voice show.
The viewers of the "Golos 60+" show accuse Professor Leonid Agutin of "insanity and sudden subtitling".
When he heard his father Nikolai Agutin's voice in the blind hearings, he knew from his first note that he would remain neutral and not return to the execution.
But the son felt superior, and he chose a relative for his team.
At that time, many felt that it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher the inadvertentness of the first stage.
But the joke took a long time, and the star's father was totally unjustifiably taking the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were upset by the impenetrable and exposed protrusion of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I've even doubted that Agutina's strength and conscience will be enough to keep her dad from falling into the very first place," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV Man program.
However, for his father, Leonid Agutin "smiled" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father at the show.
But it seems that this is not the case, viewers want an objective assessment and see real-talent performers at the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I feel the "Voice" of the Agutin team, they've been denied."
"The last time Agutin showed how he loved the pope, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his father who does not drink and whisper, how can I then call the teacher?"
"He likes to be a poet, he likes to have a concert in Kremlin for his money, and he likes to see how many people come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"Agutina's side was unprofessional."
"Then you have to invite the Pope to speak on your own show, not on the show that's being made for 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a silent dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and darkness melt, and Pope Augustine was brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that on the scene and on screen the same person for decades!
'Cause I don't want to get through this shit.
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Round mud and makeup.
And there will be no more money in the family budget.
The theater of absurdity continues!"
The users also recalled that during one of the traditional Volos' seasons, the son of Gradski was present at the blind hearings.
Then the subway and the head did not come to take the son to their own team.
More than that, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the other side of the Moon, which would help to avoid the gap that was the source of the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed for the exploration of space sources of radiation," Petrukovic added.
He also believed that the Moon could be used for the testing of robotics and for the use of local resources for construction.
In addition, the cosmonauts should be attracted to the search for a primitive body on Earth’s satellite, considered by the scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
The head of the company Roscosmos said that in an optimistic version of the RF, a piloted flight could take place on Monday by 2030.
The usual client pulled out a tray of faeces at the 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called "he had a tooth" for the manager of the 7-Eleven round-the-clock store: in May he was exposed from the store for an unpleasant behavior.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went into the store and pulled out a box containing the goods on the shelves.
There were faeces and urine in the basket that Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile bio-welfare.
Police arrested "the avenger" when the incident occurred.
He was put in prison and released to court in $300.
He was charged with illegal invasion of foreign property and criminal offences and was forbidden to enter the store and approach the manager.
Although Simms ' crime seemed rather ridiculous than serious, the judiciary could be severe enough because it had repeatedly violated the law: it was considered a major theft, robbery, illegal possession of arms, car driving in a state of unrest and ill-treatment of animals.

Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy, the only source of income is the sale of energy and Moscow is active in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, Washington Examiner writes.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar with Iran.
In the Minister's view, there are two options for developing events: military and economic.
First, he would prefer not to use it, so it was necessary to exert pressure and exacerbate Iranian energy resources.

The Russian pilot Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Prix race in Russia.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between the two cars that made me feel sorry.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of us get on the pit stop, we'd fall into clean air, and come back fast, but the resins were gone.
Plus, he was fighting with his partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he's not much wrong.
We were in this situation on the most impeccable track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, if it was fair.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Poor RIA News.
Remember that Sirotkin was the 18th winner of the Grand Prix of Russia, British Mercedes pilot Louis Hamilton.
Tarpisev called the absurd removal of Glushakov and Eštenko from the Spartan base
The president of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishtev commented on the removal of Moscow's Spartacus footballers Denis Glushakov and Andrey Eštenko from training with the main composition after a review of the Masimo Carrera team's main coach, reports Sport Weekend.
The actions of the Carrera were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is a non-worldly nonsense.
I absolutely don't agree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the disunity of the team.
First, these are verses, read and grasp them as you please.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Each one has his own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Eštenko put lipstick, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I don't think Italians have enough flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve as a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be solved at all.
Maybe I should have laughed at it all the time.
Spartacus has a lot of misconceptions in various lines, and there is a lack of play after being introduced into youth.
The inner team doesn't seem to add optimism to this match," said Tarpištev.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 7 p.m. in Moscow time.
Previously, John Terry, who refused Spartacus, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
The Sirius educators discussed environmental technologies with scientists
Educators of the Syrius School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics in Sochi attended a lecture by the National Research Centre of the Institute of Curchatov.
The survey was conducted within the framework of the Global Forum for Convergent and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, reported on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Koda Kurčevov", during which the President of the Kurčev Institute, a member of RAN correspondent Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture by a scientist published on the Sirius website.
Schoolers learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
To address this problem, the forum's organizers say that environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised responsibility for the development of environmentally friendly technologies, as well as for the risks that inevitably arise in the development of such technologies.
"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a tremendous fortune.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, an improvement in quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of environmental technologies is, in fact, a technological reproduction of living natural systems.
There is a turning point - a targeted intervention in human vitality.
There's always a risk.
The car turned up, people started to die under the wheels.
But cars are still in use.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," says a scientist named REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breaks, school students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
Speakers were nominated for physics and mathematics, the head of the NBICS-like NBICS-Kurčatov Institute of Technology, Julia Djakova, and the head of the NBICS-Technology complex, Wiacheslav Demin.
The Syrius Education Centre in Sochi has been established by the Talent and Success Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The aim of the educational centre is early detection, development and further professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that observers of the All-Russian Online Olympiad for Cybervisz Information Security will be trained in Sirius.

The largest danger to the U.S. fleet is the Russian submarine Kazan.
That's what American counter-admiral Dave Johnson said, transmitting "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.

Macedonia: the referendum did not take place due to a low incidence
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The renamed former Yugoslav Republic was forced to open the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34 per cent of the appearance of the resurrected tribes “did not reach the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to give up the renaming.
Speaking soon after the closing of the polls, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, deputy of the republic, said that if the votes in question were more " yes", Macedonia would change the name, regardless of the quorum that had not been reached.

Camerovacan rocked a flock of bananas in the cave
On the famous Cameroonian page on the social network, there was a statement by the public that horned animals were being freely slaughtered in one of the local caves.
The little flock passed between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed different opinions: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small horned cow, and their appetite could even help to clean up the territory from the weeds and the weeds of grass, but some of the city's inhabitants did not have the behavior of animals:
"It's a grave, not a trap.
There's nothing for the barans to do.
Of course, you will not say that they are greedy, but it is not the case."
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cave was already known and that the necessary measures would soon be taken.
How is it right to fight and fight?
The word pressure doesn't exist.
That's right.
The word "press" means "drawing, exerting, impacting" is only phonetic, because we hear sound [a] instead of "defence".
We use that word, assuming it comes from the word "pressurization."
But "pressurization" and "resistance" are not only the opposite, but even in some sense.
Be sure of that yourself.
To reach (circle-book, aging) means "to be sufficient, complete, enough, to satisfy someone or something."
Satisfaction, pleasure are family words.
Previously, he still had the importance of "depending on nothing, having self-reliance" - "relieve yourself."
Old Slavic "dude" by family words "command" and "will".
Push, push, push, push, push.
In these words, the fearsome "relatives": daos - "wolf", dieja - "let's die" and two of them - "treasure".
A similar phonetic form of the words “pressurization” and “resist”, as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them to become contaminated.
So we found this very “d” to be used in a letter using “a”, which is, in the best sense, incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
That's right.
But it's an outdated word that's no longer in use in its proper meaning.
If you want to notice that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you above, use the word "press".
You can also use the design to show pressure, but remember that it is an office.

"Who did you have the chance to fight for the pool today?
How good was the car?"

However, this has had little effect on the outcome."
"It's very difficult to drive in Sochi, will the start of the race be a key point?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how things will turn out.
It's not gonna be easy in any case, because our car is slowing down the Mercedes.

A welcoming person gave a small exclusive park - the magazine Behind the Roll
Miracles still happen in our lives!
One of them was told on Twitter by German journalist Kristi Ditz.
She wrote on her side that her four - year - old son had parked his bike (child bicycle without pedals) around the same lamppost throughout the year.
And one morning there was a nice sticker on the pole with a picture of a green bicycle and a label, "Only for him."
Mother's and baby's guards were out of range.
Christy thanked an anonymous volunteer and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly exploded on the tapestry and made a lot of people smile.
His comments were also remarkable:
"How wonderful!"
"Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world."
"I think there are many people in the world who are capable of such action."
"Unfortunately, they don't draw the same attention as those who go out of nowhere."
"This is the world we need!"
The readers asked the journalist if she could find out who was the author of this idea and tell them about it.
The human being seems to be somewhere nearby. He's been watching the little guy park when he's got it in his head.
The flower really deserves a place in Formula-1.
Russian driver Michael Aleshin is returning his compatriot Daniel Quetta to Formula One as a Toro Rosso pilot.
I think it's just remarkable news: Formula 1 will have another Russian pilot, and it will be Dana.
I think he really deserves this place, and he hasn't said everything in Formula One yet.
Yeah, it's often not all come true, and I don't think he's even realized some of his capabilities yet.
It will be interesting to watch his speeches in the coming year," says Alešina SMP Racing.

Many migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter requesting resignation.
With the assistance of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
About 100,000 terrorists were killed in three years of a Russian military operation in Syria, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the FP Air Force.
In connection with the third anniversary of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the WCC, the head of the Board of the Federation for Defence and Security, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air impact equipment: Air-space forces were carrying and were continuing to strike precisely at terrorist sites.
According to Bondareva, in three years' time tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria, for example, in ammunition, fortifications, fortifications and fortifications.
The Russian air force has broken down the jihadist defense, which has become a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government forces, transmitted by Interfax.
However, according to Bondareva, the operation of our troops in Syria allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, prohibited in Russia) and the Jebhat-an-Nusru ( prohibited in Russia).
According to the Gender Staff of the RF Armed Forces, about four thousand Russian civilians and about five thousand post-Soviet nationals fought on the IG side, the TASS reported.
And this is only about the registered persons, not to mention those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports allowed them to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted that in Syria, Russia was fighting international terrorism on the other side - otherwise it would be evil “to us”.
The telephones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers came to open.
The personal data of a number of former and current British ministers have been made available because of a failure in the application security system established by the Conservative Party, Sky News.
In particular, the mobile numbers of Finance Minister Philip Hammond and former head of British MIDI Boris Johnson have been available.
According to the telechannel, several politicians have made "bad calls".
The technical problem has been removed, now the application is safe.
We are investigating the causes of the failure and apologizing for any problems that arise," said the Conservative Party.
During the failures, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
Thus, in the Minister for the Environment, Ecology and Agriculture profile, Michael Gowa replaced his photograph with a photo of mediamagnet of Rupert Merdok.
Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
The Syrian MID Head, Valid Muallem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and of supporting terrorism.
[West] Coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rhaka, destroyed infrastructure and public services in areas against which it was targeted, and committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists”, as the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “the seeds of chaos, death and destruction on their way”.
The mid-term chapter also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had been almost completed and the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus was also planning to clear Syria of the illegal foreign presence, and priority would be given to Syrian partners in the reconstruction of the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Enemies in the Republic of Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko said that two U.S. F-15 aircraft had hit the Syrian province of Deir-ez-Zor with banned phosphorous munitions.
The United States of America has rejected all allegations.
The President of Ukraine, Petr Poroshenko, believes that, while respect for the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of State said this during a visit to the Harkov region, commenting on the issue by Hungary of its passports to Zakarpatya.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I protect the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," he stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he will as President protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are not in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of the State supported the position of MIDI in the passport scandal with Hungary, which was intended to send the consulate of the country from Beregov.
"I fully share every letter that has been said by the MIDI," said the President.
As FACTS reported, on 19 September there was a video on the network recording the date of the issue of Hungarian citizens to the Hungarian passports in the Hungarian Consulate.
At the same time, they made an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consular, who is posted on a video from the Ukrainians of Hungarian passports, should either leave the territory of Ukraine either by way of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also known that the Zakarpatski District Prosecutor ' s Office had initiated a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the heading “State change”.
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is well known that Vladimir Putin has spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data from Russian Battle No. 1 flights on Flightradar indicate that around 6 o'clock at the Tajikistann time on 28 September Il-96-300 travelled from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the north-east.

On the night of September 29th, the President of the Bakal24 met with the head of the Victor Zimin region.
According to informal information, Putin has come to the Republic to conduct exits, but the sources of the site believe that the real cause is “the problem of the second tour”.
The second round of elections to the heads of the region will take place next Sunday in Hakasia.
It was attended by Valentin Konovov (KPRF) and the head of the Republic of Victor Zimin (the only Russian).
On 21 September, however, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the coming round, Andrey Filagin (Justice Russia) and the Konovalovi must participate.

Putin has already visited Hakasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuvoi, this republic is one of the favorite places for the President to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of an armed conflict that has been in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, especially neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, in the view of Damascus, military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for voluntary return.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Valid al-Mullem, said, speaking in the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the success achieved in combating terrorism.
The Government is continuing to restore the damaged areas of terrorism, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult and deprived of their means of livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called upon the world community to contribute to and provide for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the United States and the countries of the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Folkswagen fully acknowledged his guilt in the "Diselgeite" in January 2017.

Thus, the management of the group has recently been redesigned and extensive restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have also been announced.
Moreover, Folkswagen promises to buy even new cars if the German cities ban diesel on their streets: such a right was granted in February of this year.

Mitrpolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with the fascists' actions
Ilarion, head of the Synod’s Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is equally true that in Fascist Germany, the Jewish custom of tying a yellow island star is to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill has been established," said a metropolis in the Russian-24 television station (Interfax).
He believed that this step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “put it outside the law”, the minister believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously known that the members of the Supreme Council were working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on the change in the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).
The latter is supposed to be renamed UPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Vice-Chairman of Pochaevska Lavra called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
Vladimimir, Vice-President of the St. Pochaevsky Labrador, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) believers was published on the website of the locals on Saturday.
At various times our predecessors and relatives of faith and spirit Christians had to exercise faith and protect their temples.
Taking into account the situation that has arisen and the information we have and the threats to the dispersal that is spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something," said the Metropolitan.
He asked for the support of a prayerful, moral one.
The deputy of the laber also stressed that it is likely that your physical presence will be required.
The priest added: "The sons of Lenin are in the spirit, they threaten the cause, and so we protect our sanctuary."
Anyone who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Labrador, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world shrine, must be prepared to protect it, said to be treated.
Mithropolite called for no consideration for those who misled the believers.
The UPC has the canonical status defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to bring in a new-style patriarch and other Roman Catholic popes.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said the deputy of the lab.
He recalled that, since October 1990, UPC had been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need, Tomos?" said the Mayor of Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other confessions of Tomos are independent of the Vatican?
Those who believed were to some extent divided and determined which of them should walk the temple.
However, someone wants to reoccur between the enemy and the divide.
Some people are dependent on shining dome on the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The Pythagoras is the largest temple complex and monasteries in Western Ukraine.
It is located at the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 km from Ternopol.
The first historical information relates to the beginning of the 13th century.

The World Left published a regular sad post in Instagram, which angered its subscribers.
"I never thought I could feel the price.
My life continues to teach me... and when I begin to understand people," said Buzz.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a position and noted that the song “life has not been seen in the present”.
"That's not what you've been suffering.
You warm up to every word you live in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliaama37.
There were also those who advised Buzowa to contact psychologists or at least to read books on the subject.
"Can you read the literature on psychology?
What do you have to do to keep the victim out of the way?" wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were those who supported the singer.
"Ola, you don't get any rest.
Your man won't say loud words all over the country and then just don't do them," said Buzovu @arina_prostyle.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and whoever changed you for paper just doesn't deserve you.
Put your nose up and go on," wrote @kreszentia_f.
Earlier, Nazarov had explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and to refuse Busov because of his lack of sympathy for the singer.
He decided to send all the money to charity.

"The good game was interesting, even though it went naked," says the official Automobile website of Vorboyeva.
"They tried to play very easily.
I really liked the first period.
They didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, our opponent was a little beaten up, we were put down.
But the removals have fed us a little bit.
The boys played well, performed the training facility.
I think if we keep playing right, we'll win.
They didn't kill, they didn't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
Good luck if we continue to play in this direction."
"Do you think the Automobile added to the meeting in Lower New York?"
"Then there was no foreign play.
During the pre-season, the teams had taken on other tasks, played a lot of young boys.
I think there was a completely different game, a second hockey game.
Automobile is a good good team.
The tournament table makes it clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, a nice atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Very good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good door.
It was hard, we were ready.
They knew the team was going down, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."
Every resident of Kalmakia is a debtor
The residents of the Republic are increasingly visiting the official website of the Office of the Federal Service of the Russian Judicial Ports by the RC.
According to the staff of the Organizational Monitoring, Information and Information Security Division of the Republican Office, more than 140 thousand visits to the site have been recorded in the past eight months, more than 42,000 of the Executive Productions Data Bank, and 661 debt payment receipts have been dropped.
According to the President of the Public Council of Russia's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, almost every resident in the region has a debt for municipal payments, GIBDD fines, bank loans, loans, and no one is insured from unforeseen situations.
But debtors can expect negative consequences, such as bans on going abroad.
That is why the Russian FPSC for the RC recommends that all those planning to travel abroad should specify information on and off outstanding debts in the Ports of Residence or at www.r08fsprus.ru.
The Service established the Executive Production Data Bank for the convenience of citizens.
This special electronic annex is available not only on the regional websites of the Russian FSSP, but also on social networks and mobile communications iPad, iPhone and smartphone.
The database contains information on the executive productions initiated by the ports of Kalmice with respect to all debtors - explains the assistant of the Russian FPSP Director for the DRC Delgir Bodgaev.
“In case of debts, the system provides information on the number and date of the commencement of the execution; the name of the body issuing the executive letter or other act; its number, amount and form of debt; the address of the Division of Judicial Ports; the FIO of the executing judicial port; and the contact phone.
Information on the progress of the output can also be found at the Public Services Portal: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"
There was a video on the network of the moment of Zacharchenko's death

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, 30 September, a referendum was held on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the opposition party “Inland Macedonian Revolution Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity” (WMRO-DPMNE) said that there would be no voting on the referendum.
As the press secretary of the Naum Stoilkovski Party explained, Mickoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the treaty which he considered to be “harmful”.
According to the press secretary, the current referendum deals with the re-allocation of the country, and not more, while the Party's strategic goal is to become a member of NATO and the EU.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, also refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that the country ' s name had been elected 27 years ago in the independence referendum. The Macedonian leader considered the country ' s rename to be a negative factor.
“There is a new semi-regulatory State, with a new name,” Ivanov noted.
An agreement on the new official designation of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Heads of Mission of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year at a celebration on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
The treaty should allow for a multi-year dispute on the country ' s name, as well as the Skopje road to NATO and the EU, as the TASS recalls.

United States dollars increase opiate production in Afghanistan
On 26 September, much has been said about the worsening of Afghanistan ' s situation in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants have launched the current terrorist war against the authorities of the State and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become a record of the number of blood attacks that have killed thousands of simple Afghans," Patrushev said.
The storms of Afghanistan started a long time ago.
Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, the United States' main enemy was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (banned in the FD), which was occupied in Afghanistan.
It has not been a month since America and NATO allies launched a military operation called Unbreakable Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Multi-thousands of American contingents and now on Afghan land.
And peace life is even more spectacular than it was then.
The U.S. forces are being hunted for dozens of their bases.
How can they get ransomed from the fighters for money, but they would not have been touched?
The Government of Afghanistan controls less than 40 per cent of the country ' s territory, according to Patrusheva.
50% in the Taliban movement ( prohibited in RF).
Another 10% is for IGIL terrorists (banned in RF).
But that's why they grow there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia, just as they did not have it in Iraq and Syria.
America, I think, is the best way to do this.
As indicated by the fact that, in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The massive growth of areas occupied by opium poppy and multibillion-billion-dollar revenues.
The Macedonians are prepared to vote on the EU-NATO referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour's right to be called Macedonia, considering the attempt at a unanimous Greek province and Greek history.
Lucko Petkovski, politician: "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There's no perfect deal.
They arise from difficult compromises that cannot be completely happy for all.”
The country is being renamed by the ruling Social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaevy.
Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Zvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in entering the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government in head with Zaevy is being forced from abroad to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, I'm losing my sovereignty.
There are clearly countries that do not wish Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fay Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country turned out to be a mess.
The choice that citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the Balkans but also Europe as a whole."
