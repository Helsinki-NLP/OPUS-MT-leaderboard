Good: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot platform at the village park was put into operation - in view of the older council assembly.
Two plants so close together: purpose or shield strike?
This question was answered yesterday by Gutach's Mayor.
"The council assembly was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lamp ensures both bikers and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The facility officially opened yesterday is important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrians, there had to be another light to their safety," Eckert said.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles per day run the municipality of Gutach on the B 33, of which about 10 percent are heavy-duty," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just ahead," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a traffic was also planned, but was rejected again because of the tightness in the intersection area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, when choosing the lamp masts, everything was tested first: "We have tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the lamp masts".
The approximately 15,000 Euro expensive lamp system itself is the "modernest thing on the market" Arnold explained.
The installation is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that for example, the lights of the drivers can be well recognized in the deep sun.
And it also saves: The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the light button, the top radar sensor tests the traffic direction.
If the road is free, it will immediately be green for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with disabilities go across the street, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the drivers here had to think as partners and watch the train.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the lamp for pedestrians green, a superior-class vehicle blew through - at bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the insanity of language, the addiction to raw violence and stupendous sexuality, the tension and insanity - have been described by the poets many times.
The bookkeeper is especially known as prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which is now visible in the garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines some elements of the autobiographical novel "Der Libeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family .2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement: a scratched sofa, on which is supposedly co-copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance reviews the presentation with a lot of direct revenue, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
In particular, the actors include some interesting screenplays.
They are hit hard, with their head sunk under water, with their avendobs being hit on the wall.
Forced into cellophane or honey, they stick to dangerously high pieces through the stage, either monologise loud or lie completely wrong on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly in this tense manner.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the band width ranges from Deep Purple to folk music.
Only by the end does the overturned performance bring something to rest, and Winkler's absurd humour shines forth.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the failing highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that is located in each car's wardrobe.
The devices that record every running mile and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The normally rather tiring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and are saying that the government can use the small boxes to record the lost kilometres – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax balances.
The Tea Party is off.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while it is not possible to agree on a procedure at the Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change to a system in which drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s not something we can only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles that have passed since 2025 with all California’s drivers in the state.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by US Americans on the Zapf column, is disputed.
But in America, there is no longer as much thought as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 Cent per gallone (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not hesitate to raise the tax just to raise a cent.
"The gas tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is appealing, for example, because tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas emissions.
The California planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state of the country for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the most long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation also have the idea of letting drivers pay back.
"It's not tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Reasoning Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American traffic ministers who, in a 2011 report, had called on the Congress to move towards a thousand-based accounting.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project covering 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the introduction and responded to the concerns of parliamentarians from rural areas who often have to lay many miles on the road to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities are not moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which is part of the East Coast transport ministries of 17 states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue every movement.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test was completed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the writers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a giant, blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can record the kilometres it has run, but not exactly when and where.
That way, according to Khan, the public would also be calmer.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally involved in helping the Federal States to tax drivers.
Rather, it was its aim to set foot in an emerging market for Kfz insurance, in which drivers would pay on the basis of the miles they had lost.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes, major errors were made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of options.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a holiday fee on the basis of the average miles of all the inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax system that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only needs to be paid for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles are collected in real time, which can be avoided by drivers.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers," says a planning document in the city.
Some traffic planners wonder, however, whether the whole line of payment per mile is not just a huge diversion manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, the Congress was able to solve the problem of bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Little team beats Wacker
The Voluntary Firefighter seized its autumn main sample in spite of staff shortages with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kimmerer had selected the property of Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
There should have been a brief conclusion to the saying.
Two people were injured by the fire and the development of smoking, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the case by Hans Kammerer, two firemen were ready to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy as it was also a narrow ladder to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stand for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were still electrical machines for wood processing.
The first disengagement took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via a superfluous hydrant at about 100 meters away.
Now, three ransoms could be made.
There was also a hole in the building for use.
Hans Kämmerer also went on to show in the exercise what is to be done with the little staff available.
In the event of a serious case, support is given to the Kingsfeld Day Task Force.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and firms
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, President Guido Wolf was also able to explain where the workers come from tomorrow in Titisee-Nestadt.
At the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he met with the business leaders of vocational schools as well as the county high school and the parents' advisors on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Steele, director of Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model training projects.
Since 2011, there has been successful cooperation in the Forest City between the funding centre, the circus gym and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family kindness in the countryside.
"It is important to have not only the family phase in view, but also the phase of care of family members due to demographic change," Wolf said.
He also said that more and more people were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their study have often gained knowledge and skills from the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the president of the country was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for expertise be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in southwest Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Keep up the pace and ensure that public transport is improved," he said to the address of the municipal politicians present.
With music experience an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years now the Kaul family has invited the dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Formerly, the older citizens were held in the Raststation.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will take place at St. Joseph's Hospital.
The natives look forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with frequent melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall is intended to be re-established on the town of Brøunlingen's repair cost plan as a pre-limitation of the old school on the road to Kirchstraße.
In the days prior to the Kilbig, the first work of repairing the front schoolyard built a small corner wall to stabilize and static discharge the natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years old.
The next step is to include Alexander Misok of the Brøunlinger Stadtbauaumt, the National Monument in the plans and to create a recovery concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation should then be made by experts, who should then be placed on the table at the Community level to decide and determine the further action.
A decision on this is likely to fall in the next year.
After the renovation, plastering and planting of the old schoolyard within the two-sided schools built in 1912, the necessary limitation walls must be refurbished and refurbished in a timely manner.
The historic, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the Church Street is mainly due to water damage and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need for repair and has a bow bend forward.
Deep cracks in individual rocks give evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently exposed.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use a schoolyard, which is done by the current consolidation work.
Initially, even in 2008/2009, school rehabilitation was planned, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historical reform of the school walls, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken to by the National Monument.
If defaults come from this side, then the city of Brăunlingen hopes for grants from the memorialists.
The students of the Brunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well repaired old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also become involved.
"I think it's wrong to give up the universal education at the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classic belong right at the Jazz site Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is a favourite candidate for a direct mandate at the Federal Election on 22 September, opposes the Green Red Government.
This forces a reorganisation of five music schools in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
Thereafter, Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US limit: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and silenced a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rails and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig under the radar," said US Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in San Diego, where a tunnel was discovered.
Duffy said: "If you continue to build such a tunnel and try to use it, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
More than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006.
Designed by experts
Due to the heavy equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about one year.
The rail system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters deep into the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeter wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine epidemic.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the desecrated Mariana.
All three men are threatened as a maximum penalty for life imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "depression" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug seizures in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the detainees, at least one six Mexicans, it was called.
You have to count on prison sentences up to ten years.
2014 Geisinger Feast Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning to the first authentic reference is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in a good eight weeks, the anniversary will come.
Geisingen and church houses were first officially mentioned together.
In churches, a certificate was produced, which mentions both places.
On March 15, there will be an official event for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July in 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
This weekend is also the church-house church festival.
The city music director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the sunbathing festival of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and dedicated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new chronicle will also be produced.
"But it should not only become a chronicle by Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which is made up of Geisingen, Church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hangstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the municipalities.
The new chronicle will then be presented in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
2014 is also another year with many Jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8th with a wedding evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and has the feast banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
Leipferdingen is 40 years old, Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates it in the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation manual owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was then a courthouse.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate.
Based on 2014 this 1250-year-old celebrates, in addition, the municipality reform remains 40 years old.
Council adopts a vision of landfills
Whether the rail crossing "Am Hirschen" should be forced to increase traffic security
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over 220,000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal track in the coming year.
In particular, there is a need to increase the safety of rail crossings - there is a conflict of trains with other vehicles in the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with one third of the costs, sharing the rest of the train and the alliance.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the details of the passage "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an outpost on the west side of the railway track in the height of the tunnel.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, on opposite sides without having to block the track.
Greeßäber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the next road at the given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed in the community controversy, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, put the criticism of the critics on the point: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas object: The crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the area of "Kuhbach" will be transported partly through this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a route for those vehicles which may not use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argued Haas.
Since the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be rebuilt and repaired, as is currently the case in Wolffach, the crossing of the railway "At "Hirschen" could also become important for a longer period of time.
The Council agreed to investigate the costs of the proposed distribution of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the refurbishment of the railway crossing was largely agreed to the extent that the necessary support walls were built so that the city could expand the next road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could create a very different problem concerning access to the "Geroltzhauser Road".
The administration had allowed the railway conversion plans from the Breinlinger Engineering Office to be examined, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser road would then be possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not to be excluded that the road conditions could lead to longer vehicle seating.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber transport and the bending functioned in the current state of development, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition, Haas argued.
At this point too, the risk of a train collision with a passing vehicle is significantly lower than that of other railway crossings, because there is a close proximity to the centre of which there is a good connection.
Even trains from the main station should have been so far removed from this place that there was no threat of collision.
Mostly, this transition was refused approval, as the town of Schiltach had to "wash out" the problem of standing vehicles, so the councils could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
As an unproblem, the board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been made with the train.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 Proposals were chosen, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
If there's at least some of them alive, nobody knows.
Selection is hard to find: whether to search for gravitational waves
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are they following earthlike planets and thus perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that will make research crucial.
The state for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the European Space Research elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas came to the debate, five of which have now come to the narrowest election.
Many bodies examined the proposals, hacked into the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Essa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with 500 known planetary systems being examined in our nearest environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could paint earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to conclude at last on what are the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be tested in specimen form.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Essa has already approved an M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The sun will start 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moon are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The first three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program are provided by the Essays.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Ice Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The worldall offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into existence, and what does it exist?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the urn.
In addition to the matter we are running, from the stars, planets and living things like we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity brings together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which its effects accelerate the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first fraction of the fraction of the nucleus, nor why dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclide", the Essa has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the whole sky and thus enable the creation of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance for a L-mission is, in the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for evidence of gravitational waves.
These include physical changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probe detector that is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves created at the origin and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope named "Athena", which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and investigate similar planets.
Among other things, proposals have already been made for sample-back transport from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, explained that he was willing to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander gave no answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele, she writes: “Even though the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalise political opinion with a penalty threat, where no defence is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charge raised by the US Ministry of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the US and Germany is burdened by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, who led the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, stated that it is appropriate to seize the opportunity to hear snowden as a witness, if this is possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Strøbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs assurance that he is "safe" there, the honourable Member said.
In his letter, Snowden explains that he was exposed to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global response to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have referred to revelations about an uncontrolled system of monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "if the difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation".
Frontier Airlines charges for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to steal handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handbag and 2 US dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to be read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the full dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the trunk over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars are calculated when the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the flight trip.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines started to charge fees for the first and second items.
Passengers who tried to handle these have therefore stopped in their handbags as much as possible, which results in the pockets being often overloaded over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most trusted customers of Frontier who had made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the box above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight of Frontier may carry a luggage free of charge, which the next person must pay 100 dollars for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed, so that passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived on the flight.
The new Frontier handbag fee will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often whistle over luggage charges and other fees, but airlines are happy to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on the Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
Most of them, however, still leave the fingers of fees for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for handbags, and later Allegiant Air followed, too, a cheap pilot.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully pursues the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s handbag fee is 50 million dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a lead position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight if passengers were faced with the company's unusual baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most irrepressible I've ever experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see dentistry and hand-held discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went like snow."
Spirit also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the full dose and that coffee would be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to ask for money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this made it shrink back seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontier's step to raise fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to be linked to the customer's own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers for direct sale with them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the most far in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half of so many miles of flyers when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
Therefore, a fare booked by a third party with a frontier of over 1000 miles is only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book on the website of Frontier places only when they buy directly.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at his headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The return went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity dropped almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as shown in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has tried to get Frontier's finances under control as part of the company's sales.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Speaking words from the Bible" and "Speaking from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the president of the Church Council, went to a Bible discussion after breakfast.
"Speaking words contain lifestyles, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several words with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called words such as: Woodworms are growing, as cups fall from the eyes, eye upon someone, his Lord is asleep, his hands are washed in innocence.
At times, the rapporteur also gave advice to her listeners on what speech it was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages took on Christel Dehner’s Church Department: All good things are three, blue, yellow.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called "bridge in the past".
To conclude, a tombola was lost.
The prices were covered on a table and were described humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, Roman Waisenegger was also mixed with the mayor.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for students in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started on the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who already work as a student in the industry are to be qualified over three winters as professionals for hotels and hostels.
"It is new that the six-month courses end with closures," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the firms would fight trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Hospital Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hacker are the fault of the website's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said on late Friday, an error has left its public website a few hours behind and not a hacker, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not reachable for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outcome was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA had previously stated against ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed that the NSA website had been bored with a DDoS attack.
In the case of such attacks, the target website is overflowed with page calls until the server is overloaded and the website is broken.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose top name once called No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and is exposed to more severe criticism from its extensive surveillance programme in the country and abroad, as a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service led to initial speculations that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without jobs decreased slightly in October from 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have responded so far to behaviour in settings.
One reason for this is according to Fielder-Builder: "We do not have any expertise in handicrafts, health care and care."
Yearly work has continued since September to offer job offers for staff in hotel and hotel accommodation.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäuer adigeblat of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Winnings at Bombardier after decrease in delivery and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% reduction in net profit after having been subjected to pressure by reverse orders and deliveries to third-quarter aircraft as well as contract problems in the railway part.
Bombardier based in Montreal also published no flight test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in the next September, in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
On the young flight of the test plane a month and a half ago, only three more take-offs followed, which makes it appear doubtful whether the test phase is going on as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price disturbance of more than eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from "outperform" to "sector performance" in order to ensure that the stock has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although we expect weaker numbers of aircraft, we are clearly disappointed with the development of the margin in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft advances.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the series of CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are now moderate, as potential buyers want to wait and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new diesel aircraft are relevant.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft's standstill time, soil tests and software updates had been put in place.
Every manufacturer plants different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a period of processing, which we have also done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is likely to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, it was called the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether 12 months after the first customer's flight, a CSeries aircraft can be operated.
Bombardier explained that it will review and update the deployment planning (EIS) in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even though they are obviously in line with Bombardi's internal planning – strengthens our view that the start-up will be moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share of the year before.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cent unchanged.
Turnover was low and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order file in the air and space party was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the area of air and space travel, the results were within our standards, but the low order entry and the overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the air and space part fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this section increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order file in the transport party was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The level of profits in the transport sector has been affected by problems of resolution in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share remained 8.5 percent and was at $4.83 after it was announced that the Google Finance Board, Patrick Pichette, will change into the board.
The Brazilian Embracer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a ten percent decrease in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired fires on Friday morning (location time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter about the short notice service, the guard was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported, the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported on several victims.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed of the situation, said White House spokesperson Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a gun with a gun in one of the escape halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the broadcaster CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and children would cry.
Among those waiting, panic broke out, many were hiding behind the chairs out of fear.
He's heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
A staff member of the TSA Security Authority has suffered a gunshot wound at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that he was brought into a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots should be close to a safety control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television images were to see how many ambulances and police cars ran in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were secured from the building.
On Twitter, users posted photos of a special use command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked and, according to CNN, they formed a long backrest.
Until landings were temporarily delayed, it was said.
However, several pilots were also to be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation has to go to prison
Bashart Ditta, 42, gave information about the underworld size of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation, fearing that his secret drug search could be discovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer named "first-class" called "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after monitoring the Scarborough police he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed that Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyer's chamber.
The findings added that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after being found in his hair, in his letter bag and on credit cards when tested.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police provided heroin and cocaine for a number of household investigations worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds for cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two prosecutions for obstructing justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and lay the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf shoe under the attorney's ton.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough called regularly with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was announced to the court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, his letter bag and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but argued against taking cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his mandate, and claimed that his discussion was subject to the "secret counsel".
During his arrest Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
In a police case, he stated that he was operating both under his private address and at the workplace, and he would be called home for legal matters.
He was informed before the court that he had called for significant arrests by important actors in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, and had informed the investigators of what they knew about them.
State Attorney Anne Wyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not being violated.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He was acting against police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his professional status to a standstill.
He stood too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehaviour and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who didn’t want to disclose information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I’ll do it right away.”
But after hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta has made the move from a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to an hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this trust and has tried to break down behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the lack of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can get away from the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years of total punishment for drug abuse.
On his website Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To complete the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the song crane Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which thrilled the audience this spring, the song choir will enrich two services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. in the service of St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lakendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Sings for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of creation.
The fair is listed in the service of God, as did the client Johann Philipp Neumann.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the band of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skeptics tend to look forward to confidence
For example, the election to the parish community in 2015 will change fundamentally in the Haslach (SE) mental care unit.
Then there is only one common parish community for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschsteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is to be implemented as satisfactorily as possible by the parish authorities.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism of the new is waning slowly, but in the face of a mistrust.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the head of the mental care team were reached.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted guidelines for mental care units in the Archdiocese Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Thereafter, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a founding council in which the priest's power of office is represented.
Of each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, in which six parishes are formed on the spot.
Your task will be to promote church life in the place.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was then a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide for the preservation of collected goods in the parishes.
On the other hand, the obligations are passed on to the whole community.
It was precisely with regard to the large planned investments, whose obligation then met all the parishes, that there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested," said Haslachs, president of the parish council, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes, Barbara Ritter, the chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neurried.
They had decided in 2006 to "be one, stay five" and had to find that this was not so easy.
The Haslacher's body of mental health services was then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish community and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be carried out at further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the parishioner Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a significant majority.
In Pfullendorf, the electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Puldendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the manager of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes to a four-headed Fullendorfer family of 70 to 90 Euros plus costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC turnover from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These refer to the additional costs that they derive from the energy shift, which they can incur by converting over the electricity price.
The town works Pfillendorf form the last member in this chain.
The Energy Supervisory Board of the company had even taken a higher turnout in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We're going from a 1 cent plus x increase," says Bias, where the number is going to be closer to the 2 cent.
Light on long red: Eight on waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just won't be green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the sign of light is defective.
What do you want to do then - drive at red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period should be "eat" which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before leaving for a malfunction of the lamp.
However, those who continue their journey despite red light must be aware that they bear the full responsibility for an accident caused by it.
Those who are less than five minutes patient do not wait long enough under circumstances, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of long red light and had to be responsible for a fatal red light failure.
The lamp wasn't perfect, but it passed a little later on to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the money penalty.
The municipality is looking forward to a solid budget.
Whenever it comes to community meetings around the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality vault in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has no longer known debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher income tax revenue and the share of the municipality in income tax.
The budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the estimated EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially at the higher level of implementation from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the return on investments is also higher.
In total, the overall decrease could now be increased by around €2.1 million to a total of €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"So you don't just shake a piece out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the communities were obviously looking forward to the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxic, but exactly these good numbers could soon be expensive for the citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the community in the past was able to give up high rates.
In turn, according to Gerster, subsidies have been reduced from the country more often.
For these grants from various scales of compensation, there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants have to present certain rates of equestrianism.
"We need to look at the topic of embodiments, as there are investments that we would like to make in the coming years," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Warmter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermmer's story at the Men's Singer Cécilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Warmter stood as usual in the colours of his male singership on stage.
Even after 60 years, the song with the now perhaps more than the favorite chorus still makes him fun.
He was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Speaker on behalf of the Cécilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His fellow singers gave him the German choir band's license and a recorded tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in traditional railways: with the MGV Beta, the singership Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the fullmaringers had loaded a colourful mix of different audiences and singing styles, which included about 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with moody songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Funny, your brothers".
To her honorable singer Hubert Wermmer prepared a small stop for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslieid".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choirs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Where far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With his mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulser" - Salzstetten, the singer's choir provided the women's share of the festival.
The mixed choir was led by the neopolitan folk way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulser" also came back into foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back with "What's the matter with the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied", where the Fullmaringer Music Association offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well on the afternoon.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and day-care facilities in the Zollernalbkreis get a post in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration desires.
Does the children's garden need a new sandbox?
Participation in the action may include all kindergartens, day-care facilities and children's cracks from the entire Zoller region.
If you have a desire for construction or decoration for your facility, you can apply for this in the Black Forest Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the children's garden building.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest boats, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects from all submissions three wishes.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner has to make sure that many of the hard workers themselves.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb Sparkasse.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the assistants.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Embarrasses Controversial Media Law
"We are in a dreadful situation and we can ask ourselves: what does Parliament mean by simply abolishing the right independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the paper that did not respect the draft legislation.
"The law is draconic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be taken over because it is an extended arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and return it to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is taking over the new law "the media effectively in an attack", whereas The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya would have suffered "a severe blow" and described the draft as "dragonic".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the theater allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the pre-load was withdrawn after a media call.
According to the new law, media houses with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan skiers can be held and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to judge the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty can already push most of the radio stations into the bank rot".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's description of "living blogosphere".
If they were to silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever find out," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians alone, they will take the country to bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public concerns in the past.
In May they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and put into effect their tax-free holdings of around 532,000 shillings per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will come true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official opening ceremony for the art race sports field was of no importance to the city and the football club.
A more pleasant time of celebration last Saturday may have been everyone’s wish, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without a rain screen or could not hold one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who framed the feast, as did some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipality, the participating companies and the members of the association.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty tenants placed 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable honorable commitment was also worthy of the country's deputy, Karl Rombach.
The city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, announced a donation to the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that repeated weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original grass pitch so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the football club's site or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thought came to mind about setting up an art race sports venue, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the sawmill in succession, agreed to a cost-sharing of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipality decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, which was decided on by Klumpp.
The construction began at 68 times 108 meters of a large art race site on June 4th.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth was cut short, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike line.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal and justice.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, parliamentary fraud and the federal police.
The working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its consultations in the morning.
Among other things, it should be a matter of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to put an end to the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide on a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda of the meeting this Friday, the SPD submerged its no to a car-moat required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "platrate for reproduction and thus ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiator explained on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of diversion on highways that were already major accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a moat for all cars would be only a first step from the perspective of Pronold.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing féhnwelle on the freelight stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be the right summer again?" Actually, the question was not on Friday evening at the Freichtbahne Killesberg.
It was really a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the battle star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver in case of an accident seriously injured
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Musch was on his way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempender's ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Toneser Street, she ignored the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The trucks were collidating.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Consistency: Consistency to crash on the ski lift
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of the Swiss Seat Ibizas on Thursday evening, at 8:00 p.m., drove on the left track of the two-track highway outside the city.
Shortly before the circuit on the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side of Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved on to the right side of the track.
This coincided with the BMW running there, a 23-year-old constanzar.
The VW pass behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of around 15,000 cases were reported to the police.
The train had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport eliminates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
As such, there will be no more Vienna Schwechat Airport in the future.
Most of the speakers' speeches fall short of this - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the introduction of breakthroughs involving individuals.
Thus, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refusing to make the calls.
By removing these viaputs - on average, about 200 personal calls per day by the speakers - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual breakthroughs have been seen relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight paths or departure times is going down here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking train with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will begin at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swathed on the cold yard.
Teams and individual fighters are measured in the disciplines of tree trunks, hippies and water reservoirs.
Four-and-a-half meters is the tree trunk long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't go far," says organizer Peter Saile.
The strain must be disposed of in the right direction, must be beaten once and then immediately to lie down.
This is evaluated with most points.
In the case of the propeller, the accuracy of the target is indicated.
From a distance of eight meters it will be thrown onto a plock.
Ability and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water supply of more than 50 metres.
Time and quantity of water in a botch are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or "Clan" team, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition win prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
The desired is a suitable dress, for example, the contestants can enter the bulkhead.
However, swivel wear is also permitted.
For "Outfit", the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in until an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been announced on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the music friends come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Blossomian music from Schömberg will form the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polkas and Maresche.
Its repertoire, however, also includes sensitive rollers and a smooth big band sound.
This will include the Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and blackberry baron.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzenft.
On Sunday, the music club Leinstetten holds breakfast, from 2 p.m. the Böffingen farm chapel is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party go off.
Activism is already the stop-acker party with DJ Ralf on Friday.
Other program items include the Old-timer and Trailer Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the handicraft market and the sheep harvest.
Specially for children, there is a strike zoo, strehhüpfburg, tractor rides (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the association Multipurpose Hall, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Fundkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with herbicide, for example, is a quartz set.
The Vegetarian Federation also calls the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt is replaced by soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hafer, almond or rice milk can be used.
Achievable plant seedlings replace traditional seedlings.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half pressed ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or an esophagus ground canvas plus three esophagus water suitable for this.
Lockers will instead of eggs with a mixture of a teaspoon of back powder, an esophagus of food strength and three esophagus of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soybean or Seidentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800,000 people are currently feeding vegans in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
There is already a fascinating view of the world-renowned Skyline, which makes up a special trip in the evening.
Due to the shift in time, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided the day at the Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day, the freedom statue was able to be reached with a ferry and set foot.
Then it went over the financial center around the Wall Street to the memorial on September 11.
On the third day, the students of the 373 meters high-rise view platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrive in their host families and experience the day of school at the Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of the name of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair will be held.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather careless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting hornblower group of the hunter Westfalen under Brigitte Kluth's leadership musicizes on Parforce horns (Natural horns in the Mood Its) after old, originally French melodies.
The sailors wear horse clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog riders on toe hunting musically.
The festival will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new coffee.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same-named café at the warehouse in the county of Kleve, in view of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the nice name has exactly that objective: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but always hand-holdable.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look into the inside life at stock 8 gives the viewer a good feeling about anhieb.
The high-modern but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top decorates the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually baked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before the opening of the beautiful café at the warehouse as gastronomists: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From transport to Kleve to the warehouse, the sympathetic Café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least by the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages between them.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic pair of owners is behind the coffee feast.
Enjoys the fragrant hot fragrance in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Steltt the cappuccino drinker.
"To do this, a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events already in the light café.
Better said one.
Because the port party took place outside - the Café Déja Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not every man's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a famous fan of Event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
It should be said that Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the warehouse in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy e-mail.
For the joy of many klevs, the guests from close and distant and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déja Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Founding Party to which the MGV had invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to have come.
At the club's venue of "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmony of each other in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Feast is always the right festiveness to perform honors.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt gratitude," said the President of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals through activity talks went to the Choir Leader Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participants, followed by the honorary President Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
The five-placed Notenwart Artur Brückener.
A special thank-you addressed the team of Verinsvirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The "Friedrich-Wilhelm" MGV meets its regular corps every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome at any time," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In the wake of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in replacing the 2015 Millennium Goals with the "sustainable development goals".
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the evening at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to undertake a process to be agreed upon with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball toplist still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about it at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet carved out trees, Malmon has in advance warned the sign finger.
I've trained many players myself in the A-young.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected whether there is further reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the race for success, the Malmon team has to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
Most of the things in the coverage work and in the switching game have been huge lately.
Equally, the exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of clashes between influential individuals
Thousands gathered in the center of Maputos under the growing eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the quantity on Thursday in the capital's independence.
For almost two weeks there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white government of Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the latest events have upset foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas events ahead of the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion dollars of companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant power, and Renamo each other are guilty of the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The abuses of the previous rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamos spokesperson told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to lower concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dlakama considered himself a "lost" who "want to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he explained that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have only contributed to the resolution of the tensions that have been led by a number of meetings this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are breaking heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to distort movement, to create concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos elections have been shrinking since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former member of Renamo, Movimento Democratica de Mocambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want a peace, because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has taken uneasy attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but is located in Beira, using the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga answered the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already taken care of corruption, progress in development, and a recent induction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protestor, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again," he said.
Children should be given myths and legends as "premiers for life", says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against cleverer tricks", and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too far away, too aggressive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", so Crossley Holland appealed for a "careful selection" of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who were "over-didactic" children would "disappointment entirely", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "indiscriminate".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel-Saxon and was the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People's Tales, said: "One can pursue certain purposes, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented under the cover of the story and not be explained.
That's the old history of showing instead of telling stories.
Hansjakob pulls again in the open
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob referred to his old-age seat in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were lived in the "Free Court".
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short play.
From the arrival of the bestowal of honorary citizenship to his death, the spinbook author and Hansjakobdörstörler Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that was very successful under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes, explained the context and bridged the time gap between the youth and the next retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, in his freedom.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade as the great son of the city.
Stilecht led by Erich Becherer of Mühlenbach with the twins and "Black Forest Füchsen".
He was not only received by the public with much applause, but also his sister, Philippines, welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and give her an unhappy life in Mimik and Gestik.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Agriturismo played selected pieces of music properly and thus finished the performance.
Heinz Winkler was then honored by Haslach's mayor, who, in the presence of the then official Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his expectation.
Their expectation then made the dragon-singer who caused Hansjakob to call: "As beautiful as it is, youth memories will live again at my own dragon-singing time".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the open as well as the Storchentag children with their sound "heraus, out".
His criticism at the official church had at that time expressed his concern about agricultural growth, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeyard, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many words of praise were given by the public for the performance.
basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players being left behind have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now a lower competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refuses an application for a possible back seat.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has created the concept for a pro club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first breath was still not to be understood from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure for so long as Düsseldorf didn't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, upstairs Düsseldorf basketball will be able to submit documents to the arbitration court and demonstrate its economic viability.
However, until now the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration panel is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening meal church goes back to the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, October 27, the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomic Kell Museum, the Haigerlocher was to be seen after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
Krönden concludes a visit to the evening meal church.
There the leaders get the history told by the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Not least in the church is the view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original authentic reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour tour is at the Atomic Kell Museum at 3 p.m.
There are cards on the box of the atomic boiler museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spa business.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask in writing questions or personally meet 30-year-olds in Russia.
This was reported by Interfax under a call for non-closed circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it said.
A snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is the ally of the United States, threatening snowden there the delivery, it said
Longer breath is paid
Six men's teams fought for the title of the League's tennis tournament.
In the end, the duration of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sport friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of local associations and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was at the forefront of the tournament.

It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tour was in the best hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Pipeweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
When winning, Carmen Müller was finally able to deliver the hiking pokal to Andre Maier/Mathias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze ladder reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes the successful sound of the tournament took place.

In a New Zealand town, Burt Muro is regarded as a loving caucus because he has taken part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream despite a heart failure.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cakes.
Squill Pipes Disturb People
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships into the hold.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard puts wind power on wind turbine logistics.
Black is rolling the coal in the storage space in front of the deic.
Two powerful blue canisters distribute or download the coal here as needed.
In each movement of the envelopes, a shrill warning sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are prescribed by law," says Matthias Schrell, CEO of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmhaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavorable wind, there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now time to keep the warning signs silent with technical measures.
He will also focus on the open dialogue with the neighbours in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has some in front of him.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to import coal for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters depthd terminal-shaped sleeper, Capesize bulk carrier can also be manufactured here for a long time.
"This year we want to knock the 3-million-tonne mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes to the network, then 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year are realistic.
The three shipyards on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns basketballer despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
"No one can forbid us from winning the best team in Europe in the past two years," budgeted Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: There is also basketball in Munich!
At its first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but in the crucial stages they were simply not sufficiently explained.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point backstage 13 minutes before turning into a lead before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought back incrediblely against the double Euroleague champion, but then made minor mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful artists of the Munichers, who had celebrated a clear victory in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepachi Siena and Polish headliner Zeilona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the Variety Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the amount of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been developed, as recently as at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival this year celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these headlines started with Carolines and then they became more and more successful until they were ever known to perform in a club,” said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform.
With the festival the world of Comedy has also grown.
A series of comedians who are taking part in the festival this year have become more unconventional, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was introduced to a cable TV sitcom (the ironic-free fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was also part of the crew at "Saturday Night Live" as well as at "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but developed into a prominent TV and film director and an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a TV broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the city hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the streets between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN mandates and Germany.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
Although it would still be a long way, the nuclear dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Young Killing Game Cams With Make
Two children committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited her victim to go hunting with them.
They were armed with machetes and knives on Tuesday at the age of 11 and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they played in a working district football in front of their apartments.
The body was discovered the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive Punta del Este beach.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half sister of the disciple they had taken should say that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described before the police the Tather march without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional murder of the 11-year-old.
The elder, among other things, called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth school.
Prisoner must be in prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threat, rape and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of imprisonment.
The former German defence soldier who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan gave up a confession in the context of a trial deal.
Thus, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to strike after a few weeks against his will.
He maintained resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who worked for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he has made contact with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who fed the women, he brought them to different brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitor partially to control their revenue.
First, the accused claimed that he suffered a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had killed him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus indicated a limited guilt, the 33-year-old gave up a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to understand the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified after a first display of telephone surveillance measures.
The hearings were marked by a high degree of aggression.
In later perceptions, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered blue spots throughout the body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metaie as normal view.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has got rid of these circles and wants to live a very normal life after prison," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price is still falling on Friday, after worrying about a high supply of a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference oil for deliveries in December was dropped by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Merchantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8% price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has been charging prices in recent weeks.
The US Energy Ministry announced on Wednesday that last week the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer rose by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell to ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents at 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court of Justice Blocked Decision on the Stop and Fresh Directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a U.S. Federal Court of Appeal blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Program (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be deferred until the city was decided on a summons.
The judge had decided in August that the city would violate the Constitution in the manner in which the program for the retention and questioning of persons will be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the measures in place, including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Board of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension required.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they wrongly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms to directives, training and service oversight, and set up a pilot programme with cameras on the body in areas where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after a police check.
An oral debate on the appeal of the city is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of civil rights prosecutors.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the time of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time peak of 684,330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collection complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Risk Program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police officers use the system.
The opposite is the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also, money would be lost and the wider problem of a police officer who, after the disappearance of thousands of places in the last decade, would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD carried out the controls.
From the happiness of the dreaming camel
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first President Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th birthday of the Association was celebrated, which can already have remarkable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the talks, pictures were shown from the inscriptions on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic installation and is now planning to become a consultant at the association, according to Hen.
In 2008, the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a rural district on the outskirts of the capital, in record time of almost one week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic should be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medic, so hen, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent with material to Africa, as in March of this year medical devices, medicines, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundant local colorite, telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile zoo and describing the experiences of the family musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When it became clear to him how much money had been lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget through the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
Neither should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it's not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive Special Adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and persecuted her, but Coulson also called and left news as the court experienced.
“In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, no one who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to bury them in a fresh way, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said that NetW used three methods to investigate stories in an investigation: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The issuer is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
How does it look with the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking message?
He argues about it, but we say, "And did he know about it?"
Noises about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by NotW's feature editor, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone for at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and their sister were stored as "projects".
During the time that the researchers lived, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to share tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulsons' activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the oathers heard that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted by an affair with a married woman when he himself was engaged to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn to others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given up the phone hacking.
By protesting against the planned empire tax, the French football is actually going through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting is going to end in vain.
In the conflict over the empire tax, the government and the professional football in France have been maneuvering themselves after a failed closure meeting in a baghole.
President François Hollande, though on Thursday at the Paris Élysée-Palast, welcomed the union and association representatives and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to convert the proposed 75 per cent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which will be paid by all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The opposite was also true.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be passed, the head of the Association of Profiling Clubs (UCF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared.
Thus, the days spent between November 29 and December 2 in the League 1 and League 2 fall.
Circumstances: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the Citizens Information Event on the High Water Protection Concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Hüßler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipality".
The high water, which went down on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, had been a cutting-edge event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häßler said.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built land as possible is the goal," Häßler said.
The planning of the protection against a German weather service is based on statistical data every 100 years to be expected of high water.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15% supplement.
In professional circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that had caused significant damage in 2009 in gechingen correspond to a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Haüßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, about four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality with State subsidies of around 70 per cent.
Housekeepers, however, pointed out that there is only support when a whole concept is implemented.
The Community is committed to the involvement of the citizens.
An intensive planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could begin with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept already presented in the municipality last week (we reported) provides for local measures in addition to the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the High Water Protection Concept, participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned Forest and Corbe engineering office from the Hill House, who presented the concept, stressed that the interaction of all the measures presented would be necessary to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, one has been kept finding the most economical solution, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Discouraged by the concerns of the old town, even in normal thunderstorms, he again suffered from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, householders pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for high water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year-old rainstorms could be destroyed.
The water channels to scale larger would smelt millions.
Serious injuries after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on the road 44 near Revensdorf at a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road, but at first they could not say anything about the accident.
However, there are various statements that should be evaluated first.
It is said that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came against her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles rolled together, and the woman was so heavy that the firearm took almost half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both accidents came into nearby hospitals.
The line remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Godseeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relationship in the outside: the staring eyes, the bar, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski and his massive Oeuvre are to be understood as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, which is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes second millenniums.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, paired with paranoia, security and faith, to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He's understood, early on, that computers are deities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the creator of his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" comes from 1956, and it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is as frightening as ours, mutants look to the future - and the police.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the Authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "There are no criminals in our company, and for that we have a punishment full of heavy criminals."
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for anti-terror laws and the NSA's interrogation.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama also works with drone philosophy and practice.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no violence department anymore, that the military controls the day-to-day and what remains of the state.
Then the supervisor himself will be monitored and a future crime will be committed.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only does wrongs and sacrifices take place in purchases, but it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer and closer to the truth.
Statement of a spa business around Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. court case about Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Court could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds in Russia personally, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, the Greens-Bund-Day deputy Hans-Christian had met Ströbele yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
Strengthen NSA disclosures Firmen paranoia due to state monitoring
At the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office should photograph the roof of the U.S. external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a verbal exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again stated in September that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign espionage to "steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms in order to enhance their international competitiveness or their profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the only member of the Whistleblower, has started publishing his full-blown horn on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The passage of time led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been confused, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to make a move, business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States is now at almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consulting company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents provided by Snowden that the US has passed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Bundestag was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It doesn’t work that way,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have killed it 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the extensive and technical refinements of the US spying authorities discovered by the snowden disclosures have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the US are subject to legal proceedings and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, some ten percent of the US members' plans to use an American provider have been rejected after disclosures about the US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snaba, SAP’s deputy CEO, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this legal area?”
Many German business leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be watched over at any price.
Economic espionage is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company usually does not comment on the countermeasures that have been taken, because this confers advantages on attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been inspired to say that taking a free USB stick at a show or the uninvited placement of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid handles when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handles were discarded later.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, two of the countries were listed in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February behind China, France, Russia and Israel, which were used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of directors of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Home Department DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very well that all countries, even if they are working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party was successful now gave a special fair in the domain of Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro look has kept up.
It's about starting with the wedding dressers.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
Before they are often dressed and covered with stickers, often with a veil, on the back they go down their backs and often end up in a trailer.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch stresses from the fashion house dresser müller.
In men the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also choose creamy or brown combinations.
It is important that the selection of the premises was explained.
Unprecedented side rooms are not optimal, the environment should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remission.
Whoever then wants to go ahead with the Kutsche has an offer for which Uwe Link.
"Cutches are also popular for wedding lines," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Photo" - i.e. series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dress," Elizabeth Keidel said.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, the guests can maintain stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
It's all for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
Repeatedly, the sportsmen of the dog friend Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured his fifth place, and with the 15 month old Marley he brought it with 87 points in place twelve.
Susi Hopp presented herself with her Woody in Class 1 with the critical views of the Director of Performance.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled ring mat in the tournament hall of his High School, are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer of the family said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11th in an upright Matthew behind the Tribune in the Sculpture Hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that the family of the 17-year-olds doubted.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
You'd never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded it.
"They believe that every logic is answered to violate the laws of physics as well as the healthy human mind," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being deceived to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and returned to the body bag," he commented.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "positionary stabbing".
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be commissioned by the FBI to conduct the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in South Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died.
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with child food allergies in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the body and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have prioritised Epinephrine – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most often used – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The federal legislators have recently amended the regulations so that schools can keep Epinephrin more in mind.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it" or "My tongue scratches".
Parents of intersexual children can choose “undetermined sex”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with indistinguishable genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned male or female to starry.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain a gender to such children, but may "undetermined" or "undetermined" on birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make concerted decisions regarding operations for an allocation of sex in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm still the girl's work created by doctors, confused and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children each year comes to the world neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (SDD), a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (eggs or heads) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used, if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding, if at all, for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happened.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexuals are different from transgender or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-sensitive, but depends on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both of them are defined at the same time or clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statum, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons are exposed to in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not with the sex image boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "unsexed" person after a court had granted the life-long preservation of a "undetermined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German exhibits will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, for the reason: “If the world is turned into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she found it better when babies were assigned to a gender at birth.
"The parent's presence is also stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermachphrodites, after the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be deleted and then rebuilt.
In the meantime, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned once it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they don't know how the child feels when they grow up with the gender assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with indistinct genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, which reflects the view that the sex can be formed.
He described the term "sex identity" and argued, social and environmental assaults – like parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and wondered whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He begged the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated when he was being stabbed, to cast the child completely and also to remove his heads and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example for a transformation that he was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations joined the public who are "not happy with the result".
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but two-dimensional genitalia.
The doctors did not know whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and his hats were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections, and was allowed to remove his breasts.
The operation has made him fruitless.
Today, he fights for others in an organisation called Interface Project for intersexuals to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, ensures that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a "unspecified" to the child," she said.
We fear that this will benefit interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law, because "it enables adults to recognize as a third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the allocation of birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a pittsburgh chestist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorised" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor deficiency of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or eggplant.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the Children's Psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, however, hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a nursing mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions too quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents experience because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the sex that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This makes it possible for children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injury to girls by shooting from a car
Unknown in a car shooting injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt.
On Thursday night in Genthin, the perpetrators were likely to have fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That was shared by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wave.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The gun came from a small car that had passed on to a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The criminals also shot at a bus stop.
A disc was broken.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out, it was called on Friday.
To date, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-dropping children who threw them against domestic fats.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, there should also be no damage to the property.
In addition, some Sylvester böllers were burned in the city area, but there was no damage here either.
A resident of the Bishop-Freundorfer Road reported that his car was wrapped in paper and his radar blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his radar blinds all back in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to act any further.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries is a dreamer.
Your house is located in a quiet area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"We hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinach phobia, but the concern that at age the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer be managed, she explains.
Also: Since a meniccus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn in her own body what it means to move with disabilities from floorwork to floorwork.
Just recently a book of hers appeared on the topic 'Happy to live in the age - What form of living is best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in old age', she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all involved with the theme 'Living in Age'.
Most people push it as long as it goes.
They're always only the others', she says.
Only when the pain pressure is really high can you think about it.
'Then it may be too late,' said Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-defined living room at the age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the old-fashioned residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick.
And: 'Without the knowledge of the country language, one can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the expert book author suggests to consider planting.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and hooks
'For me, it would be such a community, but nothing,' she says with an eyebrows.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age you just need his retreats,' said Ries.
The fact that an elderly community can still function does not, however, exclude the book author.
But this had to be different from that in the classic students' WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest,' she believes.
In this view, at least she is not alone in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it goes in their own apartment,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service living at the age of the capital.
Its service advises people about the topic 'Being elderly'.
That is why even older people would often buy inconveniences and restrictions only in order to stay in their usual surroundings, that is also the experience of the Wartest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to create the house or apartment without barriers.
Ries recommends that all those who are dealing with the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or apartment should only be informed and not be entrusted with the best artisans.
Today there are also for the old-fashioned conversion specialists.
Even in the apartment, it is possible to realize one or the other, and if it is only the toilet seat, the interior architect explains.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned properly and thus unobstructed, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Even if you could install a staircase elevator inside the apartment, which would also be a path paved with stairs up to the door of the apartment, it would be a far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more gray than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be asked to disclose unauthorized confidential information.
Therefore, he had to be tried in the United States, said U.S. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Also, the latest snowden statements would not change that.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in harsh statements it was about a parliamentarian and not about a German member of government.
Secret Service Officer Edward Snowden is generally ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former U.S. NSA employee in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter reads as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your survey on mass monitoring.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously engaged in a direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government which forced me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying the extended asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered the disclosures to be a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the abuse of public trust that had been previously covered.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchases have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat this as a breach of trust and then seeks to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
Yet, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will take this downward position.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are encountered, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and legal manner.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says the Mayor of Winterlingen Michael Maier.
The former garden in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its latest meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has transferred the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, look at the garden and clear the way.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high-summer temperatures
The music club Hammeriseinbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer Guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann takes the tackstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musichock.
Report: Obama's campaign to replace bids by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors secretly discussed replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times presented a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday that the president's senior advisors had carried out "wide group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope for re-election would be better if he let the prayer fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, a National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly outlines the history of the efforts of the campaign and the White House leaders, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the survey values that former Foreign Minister Clinton had on the vice presidents.
The potential change was a strictly hidden secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House leader David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the top of his efforts to exchange prayers despite their "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a chess suit, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing prayer through Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "What do we do about God's will?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "supply care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign he had been working to re-elect a significant effort to find out whether such a train would pay for the elections.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama's political investigations had reached its desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know from the polls whether to let prayer fall in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the e-mail in the design of the Internet service like the traditional mail technically implemented the e-mail secret?
The concept of early Internet services was primarily designed to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take into account the creation of a stable basis for a more secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, an usual email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benny", are the computers of both of them connected directly?
Anna's e-mail program or browser will first send the e-mail to her service provider's mail server.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the track, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his supplier.
Will traditional e-mails be read on their way through the network?
Most emails will be read by software robots on the way.
The provider of the consignor usually checks whether the mail carries out a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a boring and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or sorted out in at least one spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benny communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do people also read the e-mails with unknown people?
The likelihood that unauthorized people will receive an email is extremely low.
But theoretically, that's possible.
In companies administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to receive e-mails or to become aware of them.
This includes possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against read.
With high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it cannot be even recognized without further who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey of Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the most privately used postal sector.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were most recently liked, GMail could clearly add Google.
Mother scurried in the forest and paid rent
When his beloved mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and kept paying their rents and maintenance.
In order to be able to pay rent and maintenance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First he covered the death of the 89-year-olds, then he spent more than half a year in the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, the mother in need no longer needed medication.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials found this strange, they further identified it.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy did not give rise to a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first lighting ice in the dark – with the help of quails.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the marine steady and created a bright treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quallen and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby raising the pH level in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you lick it, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We've tested it in the last few months and it seemed perfect for us to put it on the market in Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the corrugated light is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his newest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is and is impossible for itself because of the light fracture caused by the ice crystals, from which ice cream consists; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a whale that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six days.
Now calculated for the Ingo Ehlers team tomorrow comes to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers says optimistically.
Finally, with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme, he has available his complete frame.
Daverden also puts us on a tempo game.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in the coverage, which has left everything other than a safe impression.
It is much more relaxing for Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first match against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to explore Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this purpose, the A-young Joost Windsut, who is active in the A-young federal leaguer HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I'm more of a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not been willing to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I guess it will not be this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween, then again, is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unimaginable objects of the last cry are.
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothing; they can now also incorporate seductive food such as pizza, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daphth Punk world dreamers will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on the costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not zymperistic.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, Lutschers, bonbons and rubber beers.
So good news for the U.S. Ministry of Commerce is that 41 million people are coming through the neighborhood with the word "sweet or acidic."
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we're not doing anything about it – we're going to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it will be sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
There's nothing more to Halloween than houses where it smells.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes in the United States that earn 500 million dollars, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you tap into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which you stand leaves a comment like a "net face expression".
But let's finally get to the cribs.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Crusade when we were children, and the cutting of a Crusade is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have made from a small age.
Fortunately, last year the baby's trend began thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to cut the baby apart and not to sit there.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on sausages, according to the US Census Bureau.
The beads, which are slowly rotted in the foreyard, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of beads were cultivated this year.
If you want to get the right points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut some pretty ones out of their 921 kilos of weight.
Apartment fire in Helbrechts: Rescue forces mountains cold bodies
The firearm had to express itself in Helbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof takes place on Friday night.
The rescue forces climb a frozen body out of the house.
Rescue forces found a frozen body in a three-family house in a fire in Helbrechts.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesperson in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night, it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm came in, the flames were already knocked out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building must not be inhabited first.
The exact reason for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church Hannover estimates that its current number will be about 1,800 pastors and pastors after the current situation until 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in a conversation with the Gospel Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daytime schedule itself.
With Burfien, for the first time the Land Church has commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for the theology study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after Abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of defamation: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my timetable and can place my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors as a soul caretaker could be very close to people.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it.
There will certainly be more money paid in the free economy, but the theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes against young people from today, not just about careers, but about meaningful work.
According to the Land Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are now in rest each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicaria.
In thin populated border areas such as the resin, the emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize studies for young people and also invite prominent students who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a free talk facility.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as for an affordable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new people for the Strapazen and reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge cars – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day for the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm called for the rescue of a dog, which placed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous footpath in a stonebreak
Cockerspanel dog Ruby was run after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the stonebreak in her miserable position
Firefighters marched down to the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firearm was able to secure a dog that stood on a 15-metre high promenade in a rock wall.
After a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon, the nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby escaped from it and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone breach on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the Stonebreak Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their missing dog and published help in social networks when it had been released after the small traffic accident.
At about 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker saw his dog running out of it, and the ruby ravaged on the 15-metre high paragraph in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station followed in place and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dogbox.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but she found nothing except exhalation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in the arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the accumulation was too large and it was broken, it would probably collapse.
The firemen have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer for Jaggers Song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altroker in the evening, and that "he backed me up when I was 18".
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made an attempt to get closer to Katy Perry".
The representative added: “Maybe she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest show at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on Anhieb in place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new history of fearlessness.
This time we are warned that an independent country of Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the password for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with stacked wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the battle lines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often bend their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small admission to what you really want from the Scottish people.
So it's not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time, I have heard the 'independence' of passport controls at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent country of Scotland expect it to dance after the European summit?
Why exchange the London Joch against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to the fore.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties will win land that is hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to raise almost five million votes in the federal election in September and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the federal day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is becoming a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the coercion in which the respective national economy is needed by maintaining the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budgetary deficits – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and this is what German politicians want to do.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, South Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – stimulated by Berlin.
The current state and currency problems have led to a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and double for gas compared with the United States.
This is a loathsome cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage-fixing writings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, a revolution is emerging, particularly in France, to the unique EU cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris to eye heights with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has expressed its own economic policy to combat the French economy hit.
The result: Marine Le Pens, a law judge, EU-enemy Front National, has just won a decisive election and thus referred the ruling socialists to three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to throw an anti-EU anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut out well in these elections – and this is very good – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to make in addition: in the not too far future, the growing resensitivity against the EU and the common currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the "Europe of the (superior) nations" that favored the General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is drawing closer to the fact that the United Kingdom will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whatever it is to say, Berlin and Brussels, what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could do quite well in a more relaxed European union if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries, similar to other countries, is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway in the same position and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the refusal of the proposed (and undertaken) cuts to be taken by Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to get a savings policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean directly puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing up at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics Children's Association in Orlando, Florida this week, Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is not a sign that puberty is entering quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Clear signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and shoulder hair as well as body smell, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift at the age of the Menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty for Girls: The Key Adviser on Dealing With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is 'early' when the increase in breast growth is accompanied by an eight-year-old growth shift.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In case of rapid progress, tests may be shown by an endicronologist to exclude serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are directed at the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is a restraint in terms of medicines, but he admits: “Repression of puberty can soften behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They take care of the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter was ten days old.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing prize is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, creating a link between body fat and entrance to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be influenced by early puberty from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already growing face and sham hair, the trend towards a fully-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shamaar is widespread even among babies and grandchildren.
"We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their child’s doctor as they should speak to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kalowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it entered earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute in the face of large orders over seat width
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-distance flights, which indicates the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seat offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try the most, but this space is the key to the efficiency claims for the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
This week, Airbus requested a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzriviale Boeing says the airlines should decide to do so.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft owners compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft and expect record orders from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" includes 406 people in the tourist class who are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share lifts over technical details by advertising in the press.
Now Airbus calls before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, and donors showed a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant and the title, "Would you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are smaller than regional Turbo Props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
Faced with changed eating habits, people are thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long journey, and by the end of the century the weight of the male average American has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival held a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional charge (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing argues with Airbus figures and says it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance air fares between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need to do in order to be successful,” explains flight crew expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For pilots it is about more ellen arc freedom, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a topic that can affect sales.
There is a competition for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the sitzlayout is the driving force behind the controversy about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its 10 seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with 10 seats per row.
"Boeing therefore asks for more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s, indicated that many passengers decided to make a closer arrangement, which could result in cheaper flight fares.
"Octeen Customs Seats would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin facilities, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-renowned Jet sellers even add band size to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-end design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of rows, but has not yet sold.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call is likely to sink to a new industry standard, but could divert from the well of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotinic vaccine could make smoking fun
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, further tests are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help one million smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, which were given nicotine, maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a 'time', the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical in order to maintain the antibody level.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be used for people if he is sure children are given before they are tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know: If they start smoking again, they are no longer satisfied with the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to overcome the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contested to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by state corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister argues that the rules on maritime pollution have been changed at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covered shares in three properties in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations into whether either of them had influenced various state ministers accordingly to extend patch contracts at Circular Quay, where both operated two restaurants and a café, without having to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is established because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodis had said earlier Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for the pacts.
The pastors were opposed and wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, contracts for companies at the Circular Quay, which contributed $2.5 million annually to the bond, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 had originally spoken for public tenders.
However, he contended that the changes had been made to requests from Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the reform of the government's pacts.
One of the telephone signatures presented by the ICAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who had changed to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where is the topic discussed in this telephone conversation the development of the commercial settlement arrangements?" asked Commissioner-in-Office Anthony Whey Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli combat aircraft attack target in Syria, such official sources
Israeli hunters would have attacked a target at the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a leading government employee against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the goal of Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already made air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a "realty test"
In the context of extended measures, the Government intends to carry out a "realty test" for foreign workers with a visa of 457.
If the test is to be introduced, it should be based on a criterion to prevent the use of 457 to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to go to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former Labour Party MPs, Maxine McKew, who had condemned the Government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting by the neighbours of Australia.
“Soundly strong statements such as ‘foreigners are to be set back’ and ‘Australia is first set aside’ are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region were to capture an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Mr Brendan O'Connor, Minister of Immigration, who spoke yesterday about trafficking in human beings in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, and the others will still be considered.
If the "reality criterion" is taken over, a person applying for a visa could be examined as to whether "the application is true in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the subsidiary."
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after having set aside hundreds of companies in the past who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan Asylant probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the island of Christmas.
The ruined nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him will be cared for by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the end of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and North England from 31.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a three-hour journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our target for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We move forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "incomprehensible" use of the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection brings the potential of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, while also providing the economic power of Scotland with an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore options for a high-speed train connection in Scotland, the benefits for everyone and the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Electronic equipment regulations in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the arrangements for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read, view or play e-books during critical flight phases if they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing.
However, Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do without work, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Aviation Insurance Authority also stated that the announcement will be seen, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," he said.
The topic is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted discussions with the CASA on an extension of her Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explained that you should be open to changes, but should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Quantas said you will remain until further notice with the current regulations.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices cannot be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate malfunctions by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbag programs and customer instruction.
"After a carrier has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases the crew will indicate passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment should be worn safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seat when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby v. Schalke, accompanied BVB-trailers had provided light-trackets for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spontaneous acoustic that was offered to the viewer just before the German Vice-Chairman Borussia Dortmund's attack at the Iduna Park signal.
The guests were mostly listening to their songs.
On the other hand, the South Tribune, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was initially exceptionally silent: no songs, no beatings.
The podet of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the Tribune there was a big flag with the inscription "Stadion Prohibition Section".
Just as always as the first BVB player entered the square as a tortoise Roman Weidenfelder, a short-term jubilee burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and weeping voices - but not for long.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune there was nothing wrong.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again recorded the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for a holiday pay.
Only five minutes before the ampfiff, the Capo came out of his podest - and until then the tension that can be grasped with his hands unfolds in a loud cry, as usual the mood on the ranks in the stadium asked for.
As the last was always the southern tribune in the row - and finally was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when with anpfiff from the South Tribune, the loud call "Derbywieger stands up" came again, everything was as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Directly before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had lighted up in the ranges and on the spot - and almost torhüter Roman Weidenfelder met.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant time for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Wattzke banned the Ultras a choreography for home play against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in Pyrotechnic matters.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
"It's going to be cutting," insured Watzke.

Pfandhouses boom in Singapore, as the crisis has reached the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, ring and a pair of earrings in a shop in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 per month (about € 1.730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is so great that ValueMax, where it has exchanged, this week became the third Pfandhaus, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The acquisition of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, homes in Singapore require an effective 17 percent annual rate, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United overseas bank requires, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, households offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income, so loans are faster than banks are possible.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to homes for help after families feel pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-income households are looking for a way to compensate for the difference in the economy.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing financial debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the Agency, the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia accounts for 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a lack of consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in view of the increasing costs, people will try to supplement their income in the middle to lower segment (income scale) wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the tendency to bind personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn the family’s jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, there are about 70 percent of the objects seized in the 200 homes of the city state gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain tied up and get back next month."
The largest Thai pawnbroker, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the Pfand store is so strong that ValueMax, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funds it with 60 per cent of Singapore's 66 million dollars, which it took this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors have been turned into crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhäusers not only offer more favourable interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers borrow items already owned by them and the liquid personal property does not increase the budgetary debate," she explains.
The loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use paving loans are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to secure gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
“It includes well-being that lends something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge the cash flow gap,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they also just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clear up the increasingly fragile NSA spa business.
Following the presentation of Mr Ströbele's Green-Deputy, Christian Ströbele, at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, outlined the conditions under which the ex-secretary staff would speak before a German state prosecutor or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Strobele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health
The Australian government is on the hard terms that are linked to the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health system to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take 'immediate measures' to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut off an emergency package, which we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediate support for election services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment due to grey star, should eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, better post-hospital care, vocational training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by the clinic staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was responsible for a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasmanian Government.
The Federal State had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the Federal State provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only benefit a little if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he commended the government for responding to his urgent request for help, which he first expressed in front of the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a great contribution to taking the state's public health system from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the Federal State, these elections will largely compete for the recent cuts.
But the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is just a "plaster solution".
"We are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has cut $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a government gets almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is entering 300 million and then doing as good as the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersec to ensure that no single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinced with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more expensive than necessary.
The action taken in France in the 1760s tells the fascinating story of Suzanne, a young Adler sent from her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superintendent and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never shifts into lust or sensational desire – and there lies its problem.
The festive seriousness with which the film is told also makes it for the public to be the qualeric butler.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, the Global Monitoring Group on Chemical Weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there came to be serious clashes near one of the locations where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which had been set up in The Hague by Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons as well as warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Britain.
On Thursday, the group of activists following the number of deaths across a network of activists in Syria declared that 120,296 people had died.
Of which 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side were 29,954 of them the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 desert soldiers and 5,375 combatants of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fights underline the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a vicious civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “now believes that it has seen all the important production and mixing/fill facilities mentioned by Syria and has survived its destruction.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites were "surrendered ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there were moved to other establishments that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the location in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw the hat against the bravery and courage that you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission that has been carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, many members of the Alawites, have been breaking up the Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the Monitoring Group Rami Abdurrahman said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Anger over the judgment of bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombing in Bali reacted in anger at the verdict of the last defender, who was brought before the court, as Umar Patek was supposed to be permanently shot.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing of 20 years in prison.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a charge was made in a number of terrorist-related indictments, including a wave of bombings against churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also referred to as the "Demolitation Man".
The decision raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation set up by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get any more grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground floor when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 2 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds ago a suicide bomber blew up a bomb-filled backpack.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and died three times while on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were set up four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first and foremost.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, there's not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to stand before the court.
He retired almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US soldiers killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent stated that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet me with the aim of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stop," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret about how much suffering he has added to others.
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Flight guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no phone calls)
Flyers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the viewing of movies, but not by telephone, so the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States were issued on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, depending on the airline concerned, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the rules for the destruction of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"According to the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may only start again when the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has a green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must turn them off again and must not start again before the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting, landing and on the runway, FAA stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to larger heights for Wi-Fi use should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it," Glading commented.
We are truly sorry to have to feel as vigilant in this matter.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres continued to be prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So not yet a "Words With Friends", the Scrabble similar online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight.
And more heavy devices such as laptops need to continue to be sold, as there is a danger of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Telephone conversations during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may ban certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem not only because they could cause potential interference with navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitters," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become universal.
In some studies, the speech is that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air traffic controllers, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices had become known by UKW radios accompanied by passengers, which at the time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are largely dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference is nothing to them.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices according to the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when we turn on.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the defendants of a lockdown of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees launched a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to find problems, but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers said he was the view that the interference through the devices is real, even though the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only individual reports of pilots who talk about disrupting aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA should allow pilots to order, in the case of instrument landing, under poor visual conditions, the decommissioning of equipment by passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as reasonable adaptation for travellers who today would be extensive with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released again by the rescue service of North Sea Bohrinsel
One by air rescue service to the coast of flying birds, which was found on a North Sea drilling island, was released into the wild again.
The waterwheel was flew last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was mounted by the Scottish animal protection organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the Centre, said: “This watercourse was probably a winter train from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds across the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the well island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly anymore, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change our relations with the EU in Britain are looking for.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think of Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 economic leaders, representing some of the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the majority of companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries are stagnant in the EU.
They wish to promote new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil from the government, rather than the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their opinion, on certain legal issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders are of the view that control over these key competences should be withdrawn after Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, since according to the companies, the costs of Brussels legislation would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area – even 40 percent of the major companies agreed to those who are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that is probably most likely said, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Great Britain wants a course towards the amendment of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "significant change" that brings the burden of action back to Britain.
This is a lot – an amendment of the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift of power from a new negotiation to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which for companies means a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas station
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Executive said.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom, CEO Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity for Russia's export routes across Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom and its incumbents in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk of conventional routes as to how to be heard on an official basis.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other downstream countries should begin at the end of the year on the planned route.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the funding possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate of the stock market.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange.
As the search for German commercial property shows, the view of the transaction volume, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Investments of real estate offer an attractive decoration," Ulbrich said.
The income gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees indicted against Jonathan Lord for sexual misconduct
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged for sexual misconduct in relation to children, before 2011 protests against childcareer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "there has never been any sexual abuse of children in the organization".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abuse of his trusted children in 1991.
Hare said that Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “it provided external checks of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as the front for child safety”.
Rather, evidence from the Commission shows that YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible quality audits of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed to "from me to the bottom" in the appointment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys for sexual misconduct at the beginning of the year during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the employee has refrained from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they would have observed violations, among other things that Lord was alone with children, that she cared privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his shot, said he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chairman was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Children's Service Director, Jacqui Barnat, who in YMCA Caringbah was the presiding Lord, was "very startling and most of the time was very unacceptable".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they had not trusted to repay their proposed notification.
Instead, he said, rather, her friendship with the Lord had affected her judgmental powers, why they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson to be learned from the "Jonathan Lord case" was "not the report" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the indictments occurred had been made by the executive director of the YMCA Children's Services Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent contamination of the evidence, however, it was "over-the-counter" and was poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was employed by Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, not a safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, verification, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, as head of state for a decade, Blair has largely avoided speaking about British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Quartet of the Peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-watch experts in Sharen found themselves in Cardiff to ride the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, which is not yet in the kindergarten and only a few months ago, took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee slowly ran through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 adults behind.
The unbreakable pair, both of them of the same size, were engaged in the annual competition due to their appearance, behavior and style, which will be held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate dress in a rough corner and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony, who are far above his age.
And Toffee got best grades for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March and since then has been practicing with Shetland-Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and went out of the square with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for more than ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like an electrician, and everyone was firing and shooting him.”
He walked on sand all the time of the arena and although he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmyards and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won't take long until he's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure he'll cut well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead.
They took care of good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fentons' sweet clothes have contributed to her part of it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is supposed to be "reformed" after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the title page had demanded the release of a reporter charged with defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribery money to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the new expression will be subject to a 'wide correction', the regulatory authority explained.
The "recording order" was produced by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several unrelated reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was irregular," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "send an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license".
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete correction of the New Express and to recommend that the relevant managers be identified in the New Express and that they review the New Express leadership team without delay."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and placed himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
It's clear to me that I've done wrong.
After Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and explained that it was a failure to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently posted statements on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite an amendment of the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing others to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-inch tunnel measuring 90 centimeters as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as a driver were charged for the possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You've been threatened with prison sentences between ten years and a lifetime of imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of irrigation channels.
The tunnel is the eight major passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640-metre walk with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken to separate himself from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (location time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope for it".
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexica, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from that in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to consume safflowers, ice or a strong edamer, these pests are not on a vegetarian's menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the meat and fish refusal, the Veganer leaves off all animal products - honey is also depleted.
What remains is to be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable impact.
"Bread bars are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of this building, which provides a variety of special products for Veganer.
Also Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop in the judgmenthouse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand vegan has lived, in Lampertheim he finds (precisely) everything he needs to live. "1997 I killed my diet and became a vegetarian".
About the turn of the century then took the next step and I became Veganer.
"The belief came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artist prefers normal leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Veganer, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of trusting in burgers, pipes or rubber bears, the Veganer has quickly discovered all new products, and the excitement has increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan doesn't turn out to be a quitter, it's not ascetic, but it's an increase." The assumption that with the exchange of food reduces the selection of food options, Proctor brings back to the power of habit.
And exactly these conditions also caused some to fail so well-meaning attempts.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to quit quickly, just like smoking," Proctor puts out a comparison.
And say, "Some tastes are not to be found on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings in a barbecue with a bunch of hammocks, champignons and a couple of Vega.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet in which it should taste quite delicious.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not only to reduce to animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin level.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
In particular, in view of the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grass on the pasture, it is doubtful whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator is the high proportion of vitamin B12," says Proctor.
For Veganer there is also the possibility to take coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Far from it, Proctor must not go for food procurement.
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find it.
I'm just going to buy something special.
"Many people ignore that only the finished products are expensive, but this is also how "normal" finished products are known."
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan courts is far more favourable and less time consuming than generally accepted.
"There's a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knuckles you can do well if you don't achieve better results in part," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little bit more back powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could also bring his parents to the barn.
Family parties give the Veganer a new scent.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already opposed to skepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act like a Veganer with fingertips.
"I don't deny people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to delay enclavendasine.
And more precisely, the day-to-day world does not seem as veganly as suspected - and the Vegan does not appear as restricted in the day-to-day as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's apples everywhere!
"Many doll stores offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he turns out to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I began to feed myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand can discover a development: "You have to talk to people about it.
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop such as the vans in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan court on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are taken for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"To avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make most of the past impossible," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in earthnuts as a coloring agent, it seems to leave courage quickly with the pursuit of ethics in so many fences and falls.
Not only has Reubenen Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are also used as food and cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to look at "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stand," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral sign that strikes upon consciousness.
He may not be able to do all he can to put his habits behind him, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in the air.
The sale of Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon by German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest case continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock market operator.
Only on Tuesday were the Nasdaq indices not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year, there were only two pans in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators needed almost a day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States was due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours.
In addition, in the past year, Facebook's stock exchange had been provided for surveillance.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchase and sales orders, later fixed the stock exchange supervision SEC and diluted the company into a record penalty of $10 million.
Consistency: Radler takes 63 years
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man was on his way to the market on Thursday evening, at 22 p.m., with a lady's bike in an orderly way on the left of the railway station.
Suddenly, when a 63-year-old man walked from a local road, the biker was no longer able to stop in time, according to the police.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the next course, and pulled a 15 centimeter long hole to the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police appoint Assange to issue a release notice
The British police today handed over a delivery message to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had been given an order "to stand up" to encourage him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not follow him, threatening him to be arrested.
Assange threatens to deliver to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to the release at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "encouraged a 40-year-old man to stand at a time chosen by us at a police station," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the submission of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage proposals after he had published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' disclosure website.
A driver with 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs gets a fine of £1,000
A penalty of £1,000 was imposed on a driver because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After being arrested by the police, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester Court, howie was found guilty of not taking the necessary care and attention.
He got seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs of £90 as well as an additional sacrifice of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally reviewed the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who keep apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp property tax in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, is already higher than that of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a treatment, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low to be taxed, regardless of the effects of the old municipal tax system.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors more restrictive as regards the purchase of property in London or the sale of owners from it," he added.
First class properties – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market at the price – in the prosperous South West London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have valued the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market, where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, such as an investigation of the city.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tail is drawn to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail turned more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In humans it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tails of their partners, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock is moving in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dog movies with dogs – either a natural-trust version or a silhouette to eliminate other detractive aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw how another unexpressed dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the changing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the swing was mainly to the left (from the perspective of the dog that wanders), their heart rate increased and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the swinging with the tail is more related to friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and host scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether the left and right of the dog was important.
Last year a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their head to the left when they saw an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a satisfied dog.
Another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: “Dolls go to a robot dog rather than to the left if it’s ‘swanz’ on the left and not right, instead of becoming restless – just different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore result in the dogs in the various studies not interpreting the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is significant evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
Since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners' disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved a show to Glasgow after her lead singer was diagnosed with cholera.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
Because of the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert must now be moved.
The announcement of the band came after having had to move a show at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner has diagnosed a liver inflammation, which is why he is unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on 20 November, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.

Pope Francis appointed the first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be called for new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will be named the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a Cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope’s chair – this is the case with a group of 120 “elected Cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistorium.
"The Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would likely be reduced by February.
He explained that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The Consistorium is therefore important next year because it has been the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overlap outside Europe, and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope Cardinals will be appointed from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called upon since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the job of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He stated that it was "good possible", that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically call from great places to cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he is".
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat deck
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat, thus a communication from the US Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for the replacement of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“If the rear end of the vehicle is pushed up, it is possible that the head restraints do not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury”, was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day government Shutdown, which had a negative effect on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The desperate cry of an Obama elector
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockage tactics of the Republicans
Blocking policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, drone attacks
Obama's memoirs over the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book right now.
It is a book from which I have believed that it would raise me during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the Memoirs Barack Obama as the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient signatures at night and I go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and for some reason could take the breath.
The election was held to an earth-based victory and the press spokesperson to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama then moved to office in 2008, he had 82% of the vote.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if one were to be cut out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partipolitic blockage tactics have cut too many efforts with which our nation should be put forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
However, after defending Obama's government against colleagues and acquaintances many times, I came to the end with my declaration attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blocking policy cannot explain why it is permitted to arrest foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, revealing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures, nor why public funding and expenditure limits would be dealt with during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the most "aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And most recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I have understood with 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Deputy's office is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre mark the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the middle of Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative that he seemed unable to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fill the hope that we had heard for so long.
However, with the decrease in Obama's approvals to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become more severe.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining branch, which was in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, filed the claim when he wanted to clear the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could check up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
However, Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit from the laws personally.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughter becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared 53 votes in favour of the re-counting to the winner of the Sunshine Coast headquarters of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that it could be made more readily available.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Whether these choices should be decided two months after the end of the vote.
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data entering a computer is hacked into, immediately selected and then resulted at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the vote list.
Is it used because you can delete the results if you don't like them?
Today, it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Election Commission has examined options for an electronic choice and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
At a public office it's about the service to the public.
"We do not seek any reward except history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations on the monetary market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in the investigations into the world's largest financial market, where the owners of $5.3 billion are changing daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the recordings of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is currently supposed to have been authorised as European leader of the Forex spot trade with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were subjected to any malpractice.
As part of Usher's Instant Message Group, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup told people who were close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had stated that it was investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with proposals that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also conducted internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are going through instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has led traders into an area which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and have said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid currency market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that "the market can already be affected by very low ticket prices".
The message came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund Office after he had lost nearly six million dollars last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is closed," said Credit Suisse.
The building on the base of the Bechtle
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Wiese" has decorated the building on the Bechtle-based piece at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, it is said in a press release.
The planned coverage of the damaged house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the land was threatened to disappear.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke to the BI.
Prior to the operation of the BI, a transponder with the message "We are for this" was posted.
However, this little interfered with the action of some 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was, "We are against the Bauruins."
So she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss continent - the giant project should fail one day.
In the discussion with many passersby before the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the project of the city will go much better, although not many have the same questions about the size of the project as the BI.
But they begin to resign, because the city is further delaying these answers, it is said on the other side of the BI.
As it was to be heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an effect.
At the municipal meeting in May, he said that he was afraid of leaving for the thermal bath, so the population should vote against the plans for a bathroom and wellness complex on the Swiss coast.
Some appear to be just too scared, others feel they are "pumping pressure" on the population, it is said in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rankick shell for Schiris: Man no queen of whales
So satisfied is Ralf Rankick with the current high form of Bundesliga-Tablelenführer Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" by the judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of Swallow King," he took the two offensive warheads to a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Ranknick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grodig last Sunday, where Senegalese became an alleged act of interfering – which was not freely as the TV images showed.
"A terrible failure," said Rangnick, the judge Harkam called "completely overruled".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German Landsman, saying: "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with the Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"Because I'm the one who got hurt," said 46-year-old.
In view of the success of the race, however, Rankick agreed to a Lobeshymne.
"There are only two words for this," he noted.
There is not much to delay.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go this way.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Besides a player, he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which obliges US citizens to complete an insurance policy or to pay a penalty by 2014 – was constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts fought on the side of the four liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against him.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also reflected the view that the rule of the Health Act should be extended by the Federal States either to extend the conditions of access to Medicaid or to remove all state Medicaid claims otherwise, unless constitutionally restrictive.
The case against the law was brought by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger in the middle of Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian desert have brought light into their dark valley.
Because of the low sun's fall rate, the Rjukan from autumn to spring, located in the western fjord valley, usually descends in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" shouted Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the halves set up sun chairs, others set up sunglasses.
So far, in the winter, the sun-families had to ride with a cableway to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has existed since 1913 in the place.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally approved the 5 million kroner (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian Alpenort Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post almost empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday learning are still in various mailboxes of the city and the parts of the city, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will soon find out that the learning on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building is taught in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether or not Sunday is taught in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth policy speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to hack here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service at the time of appointment.
"This is decompressing this business despite the increase in prices for letters in January 2013 radically and impermeablely."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and the City Alliance, supports his group colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the learning times are being changed or deleted here in secret."
From the vicinity of the city, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the towns of Neuschlöß and Rosengarten must be learned again on Sunday," says Bittner and Rührenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should also be able to reach a mailbox with a Sunday exposure on foot.
Røhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives him a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatisations.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurter Park Fees should be increased strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive.
The city's magistrate consults this morning on a presentation by traffic deserter Stefan Majer (Green).
Then the parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time range of parking watches and parking tickets should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then, the city council must decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers it "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the store is "a non-predictable advantage for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overrumple host
With a narrow frame, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturhalle in Reutlingen had to join the TG Gönningen of the Schwäbische Alb.
The Älblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, too old-fashioned, could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the citykeepers.
With the hard and placed strikes, the Gönninger became extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz purely over the network media and were not in place for the block defense.
Two high first bet wins clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of pleasure in all interests.
In view of this impressive and playful performance, the third sentence was won a bit of fun and wantless at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly able to implement in Nagold, a much stronger opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They provided a hard fight two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly when playing the ball and points gifts; also in the passports the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical playing scenes the superintendent prevented the sight of possible points wins.
In this powerfully balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed throughout the great physical use and a happy engagement of both teams.
Care day at the small English cottage
Meanwhile, on the fifth maintenance day following the Natura 2000 project of the upper Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
In view of the public's suggestions, helmut Kaiser said that this day should be cut off in the area of the huts of sight in the valley, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers described this area as the glossy piece of the slope on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the maintenance day was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to place emphasis in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the shield and wanted the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the area is covered by the goal of obtaining the now-growing old Allmandweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species, such as rare smethlers and lawnmowers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections to maintain species.
Tribukait said she does not want to miss out on this place to break a chain for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the previous maintenance days achieved for the future.
After these various presentations, Reverative Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the foreground, the forstschläcker was ready to call if necessary.
A group of assistants should take care of the release of Wacholder drills and the maintenance of a dry stone belt.
The goal was the free view of the perspective.
Running: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen can be called an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own city works, a second mayor candidate has not yet been registered.
As the only candidate for the succession of the no longer-candidate Mayor Norbert Brugger for age reasons, the 46-year-old bank buyer and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been identified.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents filed
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, insisted on Thursday a labyrinth of complaints about patent damage against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversold by him in the insolvency sale of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that had purchased the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, claimed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is seen in seven cases of patent damage.
The patents relate to technology that harmonizes search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that affects the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion dollars.
After being oversold in the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility purchased $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library for patents.
“Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patents in the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” says the complainant.
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google, since it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the charge.
Egypt prepares the first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi gives up the office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt", when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier.
With his introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt, the fifth head of state since the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He dismissed the oath before the 18 black robed judges of the court, who had his seat on the Nile and were found to be an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group, which had been widely banned by the respective government since its establishment 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen were waiting for the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred adherents had gathered before the court to celebrate the new president, and unlike the Presidential Prunk of the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the convoy could cross the usually-lived road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "responsor" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a speech of freedom, in which he not only as a candidate of the Islamists but also presented all those who wanted to achieve the aims of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he gave the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he should give his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chaplain who played the national anthem he listened to in the custody.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of audiences in the largest auditorium of the University with speakers from "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, founded as the bastion of secular education in 1908, developed into a high school of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mursi left a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to regain the presidential powers that the Military Council had assumed from the government-hunted head of state.
But with the rejection of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the military's will, indicating that the struggle of power will continue.
Mursis speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening it will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are naturally promised by the organizers on two days.
Workers hit by leaders: heavy injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg collapsed from a leader and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
As he ascended to the ladder-based leader, he threw it away and the man fell on the ground of the concrete.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescue screwdriver "Christophorus 6" to the National Hospital Salzburg.
Violent in South Africa: double life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two lifespans on Friday.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim was later killed as a result of serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered a ban on the nationwide.
The 21-year-old had raped Anne Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but were mistaken.
The view of the young people was so urgent that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be in the night with booys in a bar.
He was also able to beat them and rape them, but he fights to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially left several criminals, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape in South Africa is almost everyday: There are about 64 000 sexual violence ads every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has much more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark figures in sexual violence but on the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo was looking for the "best hams in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 Star Bondorf.
The speaker immediately explains at the beginning: The most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo's way of working in Bondorf.
"Germany's favorite hams," Jumbo announced to the Black Forest hams.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can catch the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at Speed Limbiss in Waldshut
"Here's a huge amount of work for me," said the TV makers, black-and-white hams as a mass product.
16,000 boilers per week speak for themselves.
Weight, Fat Part, Color: Uli explains what it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered for six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm nervous when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in Reinkultur.
But watching is still worth it.
The viewer sees that breaking down the boilers is still manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditional without bones in the rule.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "U-boot".
The trick: The teeth tend to provide the special taste of the black forest of ham here in smoke.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in Jumbo disappears," he announces the test food.
"It's really delicious," said the story of the TV star.
This will make it possible for all parties to live.
Did you think that travel agencies belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now proceeds from an annual tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared with 305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a 12 to 17 percent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As manager Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are in a good way towards record year income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which accounts for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that for the third year a profit is expected for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, Romantic lyric and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also includes 'unforeseen texts' in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
As of 2015, students have to pass an independent GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new teaching plans for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the Audit Authority will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new use system and less training.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become " challenging, ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hourly plan, from coalition circles it means that the extensive math examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the trade in rankings – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems in the right life', including financial mathematics.
Nice animals and delicious cakes.
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colourful strokes presents the circuit assembly performance show at this weekend in the bourgeois house.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local club W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Farmers of the associations in the Soest area show here their best animals as well as young Viking hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six price judges conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to award excellent animals.
Visitors to the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is applied to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place by the mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
For all visitors, the rabbit show is already open on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the victory.
The guests are also invited to a local-priced Tombola and to a delicious café.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conference
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Discussions on Today's Dealing With the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Seekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum the question of how people today rank the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which still characterize our ideas", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is rather marked by some difficulty or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by Christians and Christians through religious criticism," says the rapporteur.
She has "provided us with so many questions that we seem to have missed the call marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the anxiety of death".
That is why the question of "who dreams that everything may be good in the end" is linked.
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg.
She promoted Dr. theol. in 1997 as well as in Freiburg.
The qualification for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westfälische Wilhelms.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been studying systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the firmation
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the mental care unit At Kleine Heuberg have been established.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si, the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit, accompanied the service.
With the reception of the covenant, the young men said yes to their baptism and worshiped the power of the Holy Spirit.
The companies had prepared themselves in the past months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the community on the great festival.
In various projects, they came to know various tasks of the Christian community and shared the youth in Submachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthralls participants
During wonderful weather, 214 bikers came to Illmensee to cope with the roundabout course over the hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel of the event sports association Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at a short distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 altitudes, were numerous bikers who once wanted to exercise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach Linz came with the recommendation of good positions at the German championships.
Both of them were able to move out of the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the goal and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance.
In place two could be placed once again Pascal Trubel.
In the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team Albreum, who created it on the top of the victory stairs.
Two and three of Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Drivers from Owen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of bands was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest beginners.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute hats at the start.
Four drivers were able to retire from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike half-professor from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was a teammate who was a world champion in the 12-hour ferret.
This year he became a European master in this special discipline.
By doing so, Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named his own two German title in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres, it came to a swinging final in the finish line in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl ran first across the target line.
Only a second later could the Routinier Ballerstedt secure second place in the overall evaluation.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third party to the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was the area of Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to isolated villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George Bwelle looked at how his sick father had repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then a inflammation spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would've taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most of the Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle made the decision to take action against him.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a medical surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he forces up to 30 people in small buses and rides with the cut medical equipment on the roof over unassembled terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive them as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and celebrate – with its wide smiles and unlimited energy – is welcome at the happy festival.
The next morning, the team will begin the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people by road," Bwelle said.
They come from a circumference of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive hugs, gifted glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team carries out simple operations with local ingestion.
The operations usually take place in a school, a councilhouse or an apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus works Bwelle and his volunteers until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It's a tough thought, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They sleep all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the past year and knows that it makes a huge difference with its work for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a breach of performance that he had received now makes it possible for him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his business, as Bwelle said; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and health care students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students normally pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitation.
But if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and instructions.
"He's no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, he knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost permanent work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and fulfilling a promise he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut off on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his meter, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't make anything when fishing.
That's how the two just add up great.
You almost think you can see the folds in the old man's neck, about which the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of his life sitting on the chair, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who did not give up and finally, through his knowledge and his will strength, won the fight against the fish.
Janson is on the stage as a solo artist in faraway routes.
He manages to focus the attention of the public on himself, so that his monologues are not a bit boring.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewer forgets that the sea consists only of blue lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the Fischer village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the each active scene: Santiago's hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, which with her song and her glorious voice embraces Cuba's sense of living.
The four musicians play Cuba rhythms and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Going down to the Romans
At about 120 meters long, below Cologne, a canal is obtained from the Roman era.
Anyone visiting Cologne won't pass.
Around 157 meters the two towers in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two phyllic church towers realize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for its guides is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly on the dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We started in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a city that was self-righteous, and therefore the rest of the old city walls remained just what was not too big.
Most users of the parking lot are therefore also passing on to the rest of Rome today and just drop off their car.
But whoever looks more closely, in the parking deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal castings.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of hand-held stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the top level take a look in a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the source of the old domain, which unfortunately is not perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the prefecture, and here the participants go back down to the depth.
We experience here the office of the once mighty man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinence", which means as much in good German as "City of the Roman Right and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And at the prefecture it is the former state palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewerage channel, which is located about 120 metres long.
"You can take a piece quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," the guests are reminded of.
There's still a surprise at school.
After collecting the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, easy-to-use box.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the ground water that was indispensable for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the mike, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water stands can be destabilized by the changing level of the Rhine.
The Mikewe will be part of an archaeological zone on the advice site for which the construction work will begin in a short time.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Almost hacked leg: Recast of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker Environment is re-embarked after more than four years.
A trial for attempted execution, dangerous bodily injury and damage against two 30-year-olds began before the Frankfurt (Oder) Land Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent about the attack.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and had been part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the Attorney General proposed that three men, together with unknown complicators in Finowfurt, have entered a car.
All the victims were severely injured, a man would almost have lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have been part of the competing Hells Angels group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Previously there was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was about combat and a demonstration of power.
The two accused were released in early 2012.
At that time, a judge said that it was not possible to prove that the men had actually been involved in the bloodthirsty.
The criminals had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice referred the judgment to the Land Court for a review of the Court of Justice and referred it back to the Land Court for a renegotiation.
One of the accused is currently accused of another offence in the open trial.
It was especially about the reconstruction of the processes at night.
As a witness, the then instigating Commissioner was charged.
In the center were telephone conversations of the accused and other persons who had heard the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to stand up to justice almost always in a court of law for them - and not to say so.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
State Attorney Stefan Golfer of the Frankfurt (Oder) State Attorney said on request that new traces have been discovered since the last procedure.
Eleven further negotiating days have been devoted to the process.
The company does not think
The night was long, the music sounded and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the dens of the people on the driver's seat and back, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, you may be responsible for one or more cocktails or cults!
What's closer to going to the next drive-in to make yourself a little bit more comfortable?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it goes to the fast food hall late at night or in the morning.
A few potatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players are noticeable.
Because what's missing is that you regularly throw your fast-food toys out of the car window?!
First of all, at weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and parking spaces.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are the people too deaf to take the babies home, respectively, to the next miner?
It's not just that the paper plant changes the landscape.
Ties have already covered transport facilities such as guideboards and thus caused accidents.
But not according to what she thinks, she probably doesn't even know what this word really means.
When you are more often on the way in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after celebrated nights: claws, bottles and other garbage are coming up there.
There would be a couple of tits more or less but also nothing - unlike the road where no one wants to climb the rest of the room.
I already see the day when cities and municipalities will have to bleed out the shelter - and the fast food chains will have to ask for their aunts to find it.
Obama Retirement in Health Policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made a repeated, clear promise yesterday: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice, the Republicans have rejected the President in the last days, he has deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the announcements, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to take care of themselves in the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They're coming for a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population who had completed an insurance scheme themselves had to pay a different fee as their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: you have earned better," Sebelius said in a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a man named Sebelius to a councillor sitting behind her at the hearing held in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, which was whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly wondered why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up a state-funded insurance scheme in order to close itself a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday against the U.S. broadcaster CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airfield in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were definitely for Lebanon's Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab envoy Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday the night of Wednesday, and the Israeli was responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defence rockets of type S-125 Newa as well as a battery of SA-3 rockets, according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can carry explosives up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the News Agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government official with the words, he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
One speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We are not commenting on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver some ground-air missiles to Hisbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled statement that the US espionage has "extended too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected arrest, pointed out a deviation in the U.S. opposition to its monitoring programmes by saying that the espionage has been "too far off" in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also added that he and Barack Obama shared the responsibility for switching to "Autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government is engaged in a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the side of its allies.
In a speech delivered by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have found out about some things that have run out almost by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do what is still going back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to September 11th.”
He was then the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage has exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights have been misused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far."
The President is determined to make clarity clear, and he is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that its monitoring procedures saved many lives.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is prone to kill people, to blow into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and killing people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address the concerns of alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who for the first time sits as a democrat in the Senate and is chairing the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their concerns over NSA programmes.
Media reports, recorded by the NSA millions of phone data in Europe, have charged the relationship to some US allies, although the head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports were inapplicable and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden documents that the NSA has monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The leader of the National Secret Service, James Clapper, defended the spying with allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult said Murphy, his authority prepared the trip of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members shall be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route will still be developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, for John Kerry at the weekend, a trip to the Middle East and Poland is taking place to discuss the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
The use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga-Outwards game of the FSV Mainz 05 at the Augsburg FC threatens to be prevented.
Mainz's no use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he was able to do this on an individual basis.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best torso shots with six hits.
Because the majors already have to abandon the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians call for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed a appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of having made a false statement after she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that it was safe to reach her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket questioned Bamford for two days before she was able to invent the story.
Until the trial, she was on the scene in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security on the edge of Phukets, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed a appeal against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 railways on a free foot.
In Australia's reports it was to read that in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand it was a holiday.
On the side of the court, Bamford was to be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand might have tried to improve its tourist image after the recent assassination of the travel woman Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that is why it comes to a free speech.
