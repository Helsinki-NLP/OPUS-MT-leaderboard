Spectacular jumps in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wing munitions (a combination of wings), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous shrine Monserrate, located over 3,000 metres high, where many Badauds had gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure in decryption, many are interviewing a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the board of your car.
The devices, which record all the thousands of cars and transmit the information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to maintain the obsolete system of financing major American roads.
The sector in general did not have any interest in planning the major axes, and it suddenly sparked a strong animated debate and a movement of alliances.
The liberators have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel on, then use the information to write a bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress do not agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles of roads.
Thousands of drivers have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental twist.
This is truly essential to our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, who expects the state to start recording the thousands of roads by every California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much fuel as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a thousand miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while fuel prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not manageable," said Lee Munnich, a specialist in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently installed tractors on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This is the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of using the kilometer.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces citizens' liberals, as taxes could be used to change behavioural habits in order to reduce gas seizures and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate heating legislation.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market participants of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay to the mile.
"It's not just a tax plunging into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they have.
The movement was also supported by two former American Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the way of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have cost about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of the rural legislators representing the electors who have to travel for many miles every day to go to work or to town.
Several States and large cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay to the State of Kilometrics costs instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The New York City would consider one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States off the coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers have recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their lesser actions and actions.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into fully located devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and inclusive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily movements and arrivals.
Nevada is among the few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles a car travels, but not know the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to help motorists who paid taxes to States.
She was looking to find out in the emerging car insurance market where drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices that it tests have more to do with major axis planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Serious errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring to pay a flat fee based on the average number of thousands of roads by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unbelieving citizens by allowing devices to do more than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide a "payment to driving" insurance, and create a data set on real-time speed from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Carmakers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers to them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the entire mile payment debate is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on fuel.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that each pays its fair share.
"There is no need to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their private lives and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unpublished in listening
The English musician has not just surprised this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he launched a luxury reissue scheduled for 4 November, with several unpublished editions.
Four have already emerged on the screen.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in the pantoise.
On the day of its 66th anniversary, January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, date 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not the surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on 4 November.
For the occasion, he arranged a real party for his fans.
This re- edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three albums: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously revealed clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially revealed for the occasion, and two remixes.
David Bowie also made presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces each of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a perfectly mastered rock electricity.
Unedits already being listened to
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the screen.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light horse that gradually slows down to place a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems anyway in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, embellishing, give you a desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: an informant tour, a man on a rocket, a potential martien...
He dissimulates and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign The Invitation to Travel, from the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he incarnates.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, released from November 10.
Minister of Defence Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not substantially released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson ensured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them is released before they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured soldiers - who do not comply with the "universe service" rule of the army demanding that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the ten-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of the released soldiers last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist in Ontario, was released from the army despite his request to stay for another year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who declared to a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not comply with the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from time to time with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been unable to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, the injured soldiers have been severely injured for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that, among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while neo-democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American Media and Entertainment Group Disney decided to prefer tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet application.
Its global launch on Disney Group chains is expected only in 2014, detailing the release of its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, intended for children 2-7 years old, tells of the adventures of the Cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she rules the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
"Interfering with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, deputy president of the Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This type of experience comes within Disney's efforts to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years have already been used with a tablet or a phone, and 72% of the under 8 years, respectively, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the denunciation of U.S. information services, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to witness to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he is entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a escape and seeks to penalize the political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he felt that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the American Ministry of Justice, he is accused of spying and stealing property from the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said at the Online Time: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to the German officials, we will make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA had been listening to the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting him at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States," he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German Green Member, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "severe and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to "my political expression."
Citizens from all over the world, as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an unexplained system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter goes on to offer cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to such applications as Facebook, Twitter and the latest video service on demand from Netflix via their TV in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently running preliminary tests on the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained Cogeco's president and head of management Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus frames the step for its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet specified date on this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and failure," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable's p.d.g. also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech on 16 October.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chains is not working," said Audet.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CTC) would be based on interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's p.d.g.
CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and should continue with industry in the next spring.
On the basis of the results, Cogeco indicated that it recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per action.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decrease by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor established in the United States in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
With regard to Cogeco's income, they had an increase of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, with a decrease of 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's income rose by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating.
For me, it's not the indication of a change of trend, has he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very lively competition.
From horse in beef products
From horse meat has been discovered in beef-based cans, sold by two small British low-priced food hygiene agencies, today announced.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% of horse DNA.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France has been the most affected country by the presence of this kind of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four wounded, early Friday, on road 131 in Lanaudière.
Just before 4h, a motorist who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The traffic was returned to normal at 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for luggage by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened pen with them down the plane.
The new hand luggage costs relate to bags in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers only paid once at the boarding door.
Frontier's password, Kate O'Malley said that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers started paying the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges will not really be used to collect money.
It is about making it clear to Frontier's clients that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find the place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the line at a frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before they arrive at the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other costs, but airlines love them.
They believe that the cost of handling baggage is important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage costs as a sign that airlines are paying quite a price to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not been affected by the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost company Alleging followed it a little later.
The only other company that imposes such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who follows closely the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's baggage costs amounted to $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the usual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding procedure of my entire professional career," he said.
I was waiting to see tooth decays and a trunk burst at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers are on board at the speed of light."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can carry the unopened canteen with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to pay baggage costs by hand when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the premiums by 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1 000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would result in a 250-mile win.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his hometown, Denver, but his business is lagging behind and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to reinstate Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for its site pane
The National Security Agency working in the shade said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused a bug on its public site for a few hours, and not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has been inaccessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the panel was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been on the alert for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not "at all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least one online group of activists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site's tire by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA was once extremely secret, a time known as the "No Such Agency", was under the fire of projectors and was strongly criticized over the past few months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen to the agency and disclosed by former NSA counsellor Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency caused many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-Ville is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees down.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on site, and employees have been individually met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Delta Hotel Work Relations, Félix Bisson.
Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Whether he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair of Tourism at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for elderly people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling close to 600 rooms will take up to two years.
For Titan's PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employed"
After throwing the sponge with weaknesses in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the PDG of the American pneumatic Titan, is today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 137 that count the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Production Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After you quit the factory purchase project in January, you're back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "fool" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face.
Is it for Mr. Montebourg's pleasure?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, he is a charming young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Is the truth hurting you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries there are eight hours of working disability in France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are worked.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a plant that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with the right price and competent workers, this is worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory closure announcement, Goodyear had offered the employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear's closed factory.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Mr. Montebourg also needs Titan's commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on the starting allowances for all employees.
Then there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg finds that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we well intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profits are down, while air deliveries and orders are down.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from the downsizing of air traffic control and delivery during the third quarter and from contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has no longer provided flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the pilot only flew three times, and the question was then asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not expected and the stock price dropped by 8 per cent to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Financial Bank, reduced his score on Thursday, from "surperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low stock exchange rate in the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in air deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to the customers.
We think Bombardier will record new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new order is announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. Potential buyers seem to be waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential of the new airline's savings.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of management, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm commands prior to the commercial service of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday, indicating that the program was progressing according to the calendar.
"The test plane did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and plan an update period, and that is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five pilots should be flying in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of evaluating the entry schedule and would provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness of flight testing – although it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – strengthens our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 M$, or 8 cents per share, compared to 172 M$, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1m.
Analysts expected 10 cents per action and $4.56 MD, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, 57 years earlier.
Net orders are dropped to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 MD as at 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13 per cent to reach $2m.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that the income of this division had increased from nearly 11% to 2.1 MD$.
The order book of the Transport Division totaled $32.6 Md as at 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from implementation problems regarding some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The Bombardier course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of the Google Inc financial management, would be in the board of directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and competing closest to Bombardier, said on Thursday a 10% reduction in its quarterly profits.
Two 23- and 27-year-old experts were carried missing in a toothpaste under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, we learned from the Speleo rescue of Isère on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one in practice and the other not, were on the ground Thursday at 9:30 p.m. to perform a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We've been without them since then, we've specified the same source.
"The experts should have gone around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo relief organization.
Tens of people on site
Twenty-ten rescuers, ten French Speleo rescue civilians, as well as gangrene, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two experts were located.
"It is another group of experts who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavitate, have transmitted the information to one of the relief teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "expunged but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps waiting for the rescue, the prefecture said.
Realistically, they should emerge from the cavitation with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to escape Google and Yahoo
The German journalist union invited its adherents on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the next few new revelations on the activities of US and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid up to a new order to use Google and Yahoo search engines and messages," she said in a communiqué.
It considers the Washington Post's information "disgusting", according to which the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research done by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union, who claims 38,000 adherents.
Repetitious fires: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Gruwels of "relifting" fires in Brussels does not please everyone.
To remind us, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a draft test to repatriate 16 lighthouses of the region to the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to rekindle all the Brussels signals for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands Brigitte Grouwels' "demission".
"I am not happy to spend the money of Brussels in lifting the signaling posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his Fleming of the Capital," Mr. De Bock said in a statement.
After her black-yellow taxis, she finally repatriated herself in dark-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-yellow-y
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money spent by a CD&V minister who himself implements the NVA program.
It is a great time to stop Flanders Troie's horse.
"Remember, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, 0.5% of Brussels!" concludes Mr De Bock.
the port of Pont-de-Buis unmounted
The ecotax port of Pont-de-Buis, during which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Grapes arrived on the spot shortly after 10 hours, and the traffic on the country was diverted into the crowd.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Prefecture of the Finistère Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, portico manager.
This is the last of the three eco-tax ports in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected lenses.
They can thus acquire an listener, a charger or even an ordering studio.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
At the same price, it is also possible to acquire a micro-fibre-made protective house or an intra-sonic earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him right now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or I didn't know how to go on with it.
There is no revenue, no employment mode to cross the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there were signs.
For the first time, it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle wake-up in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who is accompanying me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found her body empty, crawled on this hospital bed in the cold drapes.
In the same way, his funerals were an ice-cream stared around the mist by candles that would frame his circle.
I thought she was leaving.
Little by little day or night apparitions, a little timid, a little wiped out, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving in the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that she believed in mourning.
And then she was revealing to me my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnates this person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This journey of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "in the inside and out," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I've had difficult relationships with him until he gets old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, he was always encouraging me, he was living my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me alone.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them close to me.
Every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always mean it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I always dream of them, maybe not all night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, but there is always something that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when that happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the contrary and they fit into my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The look of my echoography where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I would wake up, I would get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was suffocating and happy that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell you this common memory that lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say, the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor who I was at the time.
Despite all this, I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times of difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, were not, with the retreat, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the right of the mind of the one who was a fiery believer.
Now, I feel it as a daily presence, a well-being soul, a life-saving spirit.
I can see his eyes staring at me.
My mother died ten years ago now.
He died after he talked to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, tears that start alone, anywhere, whenever, in unusual places, moments uncongruous.
Then the time has calmed down.
There was nothing left but the lack, the lack of answers, the need for her, to trust me, to reassure me of her sweetness.
Yet, she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes looking at me, I see the shadows that keep his eye on him, the laughs around his lips that grow cigarettes, the most who mark the front of the days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little to smile at, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to him in the middle of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites in my dreams when morals are a little bit affected.
We feel worn out and protected in difficult times, the receding of time makes us realize how much she was the head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the path she had followed.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take you away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 after an asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, always acting on what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't miss it, and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
Voila soon 30 years old when my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The huge punishment that then invaded me has certainly softened, but it's always close to me.
Very often he "dreams" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that in the wake I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in a hurry, anxious and I lit the hair lamp looking everywhere, convinced he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel noticed and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world, I would not leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since she left, it's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I'm social with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I'm out, I'm a grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the most bloody month since 2008
October was Iraq's most murderous month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq was received by the American President.
Nouri al-Maliki wants to help the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be around us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will extend, and what is happening in Syria will extend as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Nouri al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were branding him as a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug employer of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the Lord of Crime Neil Scarbough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Seat Court
A major defence lawyer, who had informed a drug employer of an important police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction was not revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years of age, provided sensitive information to the Lord of Crime Neil Scarbrough on investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "prior record", was arrested at his home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers found Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three cocaine bags at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with brothers.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
In a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought information illegally on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years of age, provided information to criminals because he feared that her addiction would not be revealed to the large day.
Today, at Liverpool's sitting court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Applicants lawyer's office in Blackburn, fell into dissatisfaction after being found guilty of two Chiefs of Indictment to Justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drug, just at 60%, under the lawyer's balls in a black golf course.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly contacted by phone with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the seat of the Blackburn Rovers Club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drug and called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to take cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all arrested and picked up a sample of hair.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that it was possible for customers to appeal to him for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "If someone has to know that there is no need to violate the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He prevented the police from investigating as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he began to seek drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never compromised it and has made it vulnerable to the back thinking of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have commissioned it to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the paint of his profession.
The Lancashire unit of serious and organized crime investigated Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three cocaine accused leaders and is now indicting justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law.
We'll find you and translate you into court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after complaining of complicit trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a meeting of questions/answers on herself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall of the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
In November, she recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous Respect interpreter had told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "hard".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaboard covered with a light coat: the heat blow at Menton could be fried with the lighting bill.
In contrast to many commons, invoices are also regulated by taxpayers, not by associations of traders.
To ease its costs, the city used LEDs.
But also a different management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least 2 wounded.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred in Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff headed for the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon the police force intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is under evacuation and air traffic is interrupted.
From the classical song for adolescents
Every time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five phrases imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a strong dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to privatize the classical song.
In addition to this show, the lyrical Art Society of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of.
The lyrical appéro, the concert-beneficiary held last August, with the soprano coloration Marie-Éve Munger competition, has been added to these activities.
This was a beneficial activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air from the mouse.
Without providing precise figures, the president of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to show himself to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well-designed, even in the long term.
We have stronger and constant support.
"Financing is fleeting and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we spend seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even further," added the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six heads of charge, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening profession, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid responses of the police officers involved and their ability to unravel the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packet by means of a communication.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective redress against the Saint-Croix Brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against the brothers of Saint-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the oratory of Saint-Joseph, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., who would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint Joseph, where he was serving as a priest and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, was it possible for me to register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has the speciality of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where damage could have been caused by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the St. Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underlines that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse against children", that they "have exerted a moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims", that they "were aware of sexual abuse committed and yet suffocated", and that they "have deliberately and deliberately chosen to ignore the problem".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Croix brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives about this by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility accepted by the Court is established, the hearings shall be held at the second stage, i.e. on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had agreed to settle the friendly before hearings were held on the ground.
An important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSalle area in Montreal on Thursday night.
The relief was called about 1h, Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were rushed to the sites spent about an hour to control the brewery.
The fire has "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the head of operations of the Fire Safety Service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injured persons, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical assistance to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft medical assistance bill to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we focus on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would become minimal.
The President of the Québec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of the next generation.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the population regarding the recruitment of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the step.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end-of-life should be clarified before the bill was adopted.
The Kenyan Press Indicates Controversial Media Act
"It is a defamatory country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from valuing the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper, challenging the bill and asking it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent internet stations and websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that the restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and to refer it to the parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "the grip on the media". The Standard stated, as far as it was concerned, that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suddenly come up" and festered the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in Westgate's shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by disseminating video surveillance camera images on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were breaking down the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimajyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to interrogate them, although the call was withdrawn following a riot in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million shillings Kenyans and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or being no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations".
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do whatever they want in any form of impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"In their own books, political men would make the country fail and take us back to the hunt and the pickup."
The Kenyan legislators have been the target of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their Mirobular wages of about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempted months – which are among the highest in the world.
A hard year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at Laval's Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a total of a stir in the direction of the City of Health Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave or short-term leave, the pharmacy department has found itself very poor in staff.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the detonation, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the building have been rationalized or reduced, while things are being replaced.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young [pharmacies resident] to come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this hard period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier announced for the Department of Pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired over the past few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain in the employment of the CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore complete our departures last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always concerned, because we have a young environment and many young women are employed, so with pregnant women, we're almost always on three maternity leave when it's all right, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more and there were no pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career in cinema through the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This porn drama is green, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadrant acre to sex since his adolescence.
Stacy Martin's look with his age is striking: a brothel silhouette, a diaphne tent and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on the ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Roof: Stacy Martin appears on the bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their powder on the plate, he used X professionals for the most ossified sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses into their last breakups, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following pickups to the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the head of the facility had the room evacuated and prevented firefighters from smelling.
About 70 people left the meeting.
People were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the bottom of lacrymogenic jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the film management has played the precautionary principle and the security of its clients in depth.
The room was blown up and everything went into order.
The cinema was able to resume its rights and the customers to find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
On the day of Halloween, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine into the country in citroilles, Thursday morning, at Montréal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the passenger's baggage examination that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been divided into three lemons that had been previously empty.
The drug was then transported to the Office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (GRC) who took the lead in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border service officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have conducted 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1653 drug seizures were carried out by border services in the Quebec region.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday morning, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A fleet of short-range SA-8 air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) was not confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances close to the one that had occurred on July 5th: at that time, it was also an anonymous US officer who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed at the Yakhont submarine missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israel's leaders had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has reduced Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance out of three that it will be reduced again by one year.
"It is less likely that the government's strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," explains the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits received abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have resorted massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, sinking, the agency increasingly considers an assessment, which would inflame its external debt.
Kiev also needed liquidity to settle its imports of gas to Russia, which claimed that it had not paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukraine's power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was published on the following day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth quarter from July to September.
Its relatively modest endowment in recent years and S&P has been estimated at 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been demanding the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 had given it $15.3 billion, and has now only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new infertile mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important needs for external funding" were "vulnerabilities", but also "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "a short-term improvement cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential election is scheduled in 2015, according to the expert, interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also refers to the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be a short- and medium-term negative effect on Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who fear the "commercial restrictions" on Moscow side.
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green fire from the United States to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the American authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger is approaching the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third publicist.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the period of review of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a communication.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HRR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they added.
The Congolese army is prosecuting the rebels of the M23
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would search the M23 rebels into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be at the point of being beaten after being chased from the localities of the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been monitoring the insurrection since the beginning, 20 months ago.
"We're going to pursue the M23 and we're going to pick it up wherever it's hidden because it's criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman, told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring Congolese people for too long.
Time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the settlements under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military reversals would not alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23.
Mountations are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last location in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion saw the day in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, enjoying the escape from the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in DRC, the world's largest staffing force, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, FARDC's major state of affairs has been remanded and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be reaching its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - this would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
Experts from the United Nations accused Rwanda, which denied military support for M23, which was formed at the start of Mutiny Congolese former Congolese military forces.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to prove detention, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military reprisals following the deaths in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the city to welcome the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived for one year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be released by the army," says a resident of Uganda's border area.
"We lived in terror (M23), we were traumatized," said this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a suspected patient were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of reaching Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease had already killed 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit on Friday due to the decrease in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production increased while still decreasing compared to the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Reuters surveyed analysts averaged $2.71 in profit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, rising from 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of the downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from $45 per cent to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a net down profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the costs of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students in two residences, a service offered by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Mrs. Lefèvre.
According to her, the SRSC was invited to a mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, concert and find solutions," she says.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu's emergency
Faced with the front held for several months by a number of staff and a number of trade unions, including CGT, the Minister of Health Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "decelerate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency that could not take place on 4 November".
An official request made "to avoid any risk of taking care of the emergency in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed at not depriving the PS campaign of a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even if APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who would provide about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passes to the Hotel-God emergency will all have received to deliver the thirty serious cases per day to the emergency of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the hospital.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency services will place five general medical services on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The Hotel-God emergency reception service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," assures Loïc Capron, President of the APHP Medical Commission (CME), who supports the project of management.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by firemen, only those coming by their own means," says Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he said, using the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, will they also ensure.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"The things are going on gradually," answers Nicolas Peju, ARS spokesman for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Releases from its SMUR Chief's post in early July to have led the front against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "warning launcher" against a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergency that were renewed less than five years ago," he estimates.
For him, "if other Paris emergency services could absorb the excess, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly consumed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière's emergencies.
The ARS argues that 30 "dispatched" patients on multiple sites are not at risk of representing an "advance" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also be strengthened.
As with APHP, the "new hospital model" has been on the way since 7 October and should continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist physicians should also participate in the establishment of an "absence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose?"Gérald Kierzek asks why "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best supply of care.
If the minister does not take care of this Monday, we will change our bra, says Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Paris's UPP advisor and 4th round, he clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the Hotel God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to our responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled on Monday morning about France While she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable schedule of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama ends the IMF and the World Bank hearings
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, an American official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its efforts in the matter of NSA listening after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank monitoring has been mentioned by the information agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the issue, one of the heads of the U.S. administration replied: "The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance to the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressing itself under the seal of the anonymity, the manager did not specify whether such monitoring had been established in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of these practices over the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one closing the ears of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Information Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that information agencies are authorised to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of “sustainable development goals” aimed at replacing MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began its surveillance in Rio de Janeiro.
They were contained in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the watch of the summit that it was now time to "overstep national interests".
"I am happy that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt to the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These ODAs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
The security concern in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts erupt among powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, while touring them, thousands gathered at the Maputo centre to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her working clothes against a tea-shirt with the mention of "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd in the place of Independence of Thursday's capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day of reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangovers since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported at first by the white-run Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko in the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have been renouncing each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of recent confrontations and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of the Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were then degenerate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for launching the conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered a "lost" who wanted to use "all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga stated that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to reconcile the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain a greater number of votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should retire at the end of his second term of office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mr. Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has led to disruptive light attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the leaders of the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is for the latter to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestor, said that people wanted only stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
It should teach myths and legends to children as "models of life-style," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "brutal force does not make the weight of subtle Russia," while Arthur's legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscenity to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minimum selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it tremendous that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been complaining about this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly teaching" makes children "distorted completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you will prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlined; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The basis is known for what we show and what we don't say.
One of Hamas' army fighters was killed this evening and another injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli shield.
NSA espionage: the United States is "go too far", Kerry admits.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington's first debate with Europe on mass data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and demise between the United States and its European allies, it is the first time an American government official explicitly admits the practices disputed in the perception of communications and data NSAs in Europe.
"In some cases, I give it to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will no longer happen in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London which he has been participating since Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified information and information collection practices through the necessary anti-terrorist struggle and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry ensured that the US authorities had since played out many attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploded, and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," argued the patron of American diplomacy.
And, John Kerry said at the address of the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to collect information.
"Yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriate," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal on a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one would feel deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British NSA homologue, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
One of the documents believed that some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January - from metadata on e-mails, text items or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European States and while leaks in the US press claimed that the American president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the patron of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, deposed him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to European information services that would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where the NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be for Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has called on the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans in a wide international network of spying that has also caused China's invasion.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's permission, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League Club 1 in a communiqué.
The PSG, the leader of the championship before Monaco, in contrast to the goals, disseminated the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the attacker of 32 years.
The communiqué simply indicates that it is "damaged", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from left knee inflammation at his selection return, beginning months.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes a lay ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the deceased cremated in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris mayor's office, must attend and then explain his funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obscenities, more and more French choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For loved ones, this is the opposite: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice president of the National Ethics Committee of the Funeral, emphasizes the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompani the phases of mourning".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which holds to the "clearing of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in certain Nordic and Protestant countries still ill-lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Hyatology and author of the book Aproving Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to improvise it.
Approve cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that which he would be entitled to with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their relatives, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73 per cent of those who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they've been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ashtrays," notes M. Michaud-Nérard.
70 per cent of the institutions are now offering ceremony masters, who, in the presence of the body, perform the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, link him to others, evoke him, make sense of his death, organize the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
The teachers of the ceremony are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several commemorative, secular and non-religious ceremonies, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online, with the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium has allowed us to relax.
In La Seyne, the clock for rats turns to controversy
Early in the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructador D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Earth Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, that the couple and their three children be placed in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took excessive proportions, Joël Canapa, the head of the office.
Rats, there's always been one in the cities.
The demarcation company carries out two shifts a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, on every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have made 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not pulsate in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, degradation products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, one will not kill a guy.
"We did not invite rats to our home," defends the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of breath and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The assessment was based on the backlog of the dollar to the yen, which is detrimental to the export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index has lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix has surrendered 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1 668 yen.
A house with flames in the Vieux-Québec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Vieux-Québec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firemen were deployed at 9 Hébert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-storey house on four floors behind the Québec Seminary Court.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, which were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"So the alarms happened, because it took strength to attack the building, because it's buildings attached here," explained France Loiselle, a spokesperson for the Québec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of Vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was recaptured more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of the posterheads came out to Carolina, and they had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has taken on the scale, just like the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have been visited by non-traditional circuits, such as small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cabled chain ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football happily lascif of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in Saturday Night Live and was part of the casting of the "parks and Recreation" series, but she is still better known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a single voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at the Hotel de Ville, in the centre of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
The oil price continues to decline and comes close to $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to decline on Friday, while the concerns about the importance of stocks accounted for a report showing that the Chinese Gourmand electricity manufacturing sector was increasing.
The U.S. gross reference price for delivery in December dropped from $14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchange on the New York Exchange Market (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that American supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue after growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference to the international gross already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to the $108.58 barium on Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Withdrawal of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal restored some restrictions on the right to voluntary abortion that had been blocked by a court of first instance this week in Texas.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is widely challenged will come into force.
The court's ruling means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a "privileged admission" in local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment.
The defenders of the GIV argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the State clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court judge had considered that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional at the time of entry into force of the law.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the governor's office, asked the court to cancel the trial of the first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to force, alongside hearings, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television station, 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show at your meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bass.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first prize.
Like every year, the first auditions embrace a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
They are numerous to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition of making a laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on NYPD's monitoring and investigation policy
A federal appeal court blocked on Thursday a judge's decision requiring changes in the monitoring and investigation program of the New York Police Department and dismissed him from the file.
The U.S. Appeals Court (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the appeal by the city.
The judge had found in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and correctional orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department modify its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had found that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black men and of Hispanic origin as part of their control and investigation program.
It designated an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-based cameras in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of the persons whose case was rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal should take place after 14 March 2014.
The monitoring and investigation tactics have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and survey system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls mainly concerning black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Participants in the NYPD's monitoring and investigation program said they would end unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective police forces and trust them, and can change the way police departments use politics.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, constitute a waste of money, and would not solve the wider problem of pressure police forces after police officers have been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not put an end to the practices of monitoring and digging, which were constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants have to vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month at the price of the property that goes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay us fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million for where...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the Chef of Elysée
Entered into 500 m2 of elegant kitchens as done after working in embassies, the cook engraved all the steps until he became chief, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Holland, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and feeding an countless large number of people in this world in an almost anonymous way that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years of age.
The man with open face, degarni skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in the St. Aubin Ferté, is the holder of a Pastery CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle of Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she was coming directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in Elisea's kitchens!
It does not move to Heads of State who were showing a relative indifference to land-based food, "they are all gourmets," politely denouncing Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the dishes returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "there's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, "has no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners in Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people must be used in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were mistakes.
Now the former chef of the Elysée, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, went with a brush to the heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"Its human side has emerged," he relates.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part for seventeen years in Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the dawn of flames in the Vieux-Québec on Friday afternoon.
The building of four houses, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three alarms at the fire service.
The fire was declared in advance, but it rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Québec Fire Protection Service, stated that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a size challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in a close manner.
The fire house covered four homes, but no tenant was on the spot at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the flavors have deviated from the thesis of a criminal act.
Wall Street Loop: Out of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose role, that of an ambitious New York courtier, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decouple you in his role of trading decoy.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then ascended a ladder that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the glamorous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man sets off parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The exit of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its installation too long.
It would seem the movie lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone piracy to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon tube on a link involving the Interior Minister then in office, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "good special adviser".
He was reported to the court that the newspaper had commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and to "plant constantly in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him vocal messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, is the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say," said Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, he cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first one?
Did he know about phone piracy?
He says otherwise, but we say, "Of course, of course."
The rumors about a relationship involving Clarke were first taken up by NotW's editorial office when a source, proving a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voicemails were recorded on its phone at least three times, was arrested at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found arrests on the private detective's computer concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former head reporter James Weatherup monitored Ms. Pawlby's lesser facts and actions.
In a voicemail he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to speak to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as other important men, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defenser Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to conspire with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in full flames of violence
The U.S. President was due to receive on Friday, November 1, 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking U.S. aid to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq had its most murderous month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday, 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the October violence, of which 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations also provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence is becoming more and more violent despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched by the Government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by the Shiite.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of the American troops, the level of violence frightens a new engagement while Syria is nearing a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are beaten in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and of being the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (sunnit extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nuri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the heart of interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki in the United States, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had set out an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the election of Congress.
On Thursday, he appealed to the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance in Iraq is supported by influential republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, for giving him the partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uighor group of Tiananmen's attack
The Chinese Homeland Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists on Friday of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people at Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, slammed on the crowd that was in the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the repression of murder carried out in 1989, and set fire to its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office for Internal Security, accused the Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many oighours, a Turkish-phone minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkey.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are animated by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng said to the Hong Kong Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was holding on was the Islamic movement of East Turkey," he added, as his statement was repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of Uighur origin and stated that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican is investigating contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishop conference, with the intention of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope François plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to investigate the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks the last five rebels
The Irrevocables of the M23, or a few hundred combatants, were reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, battles continue despite the night," said a resident of Jomba to the AFP, attached by phone at 12:30, and according to which a girl was injured by ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the confrontations has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have slightly rejected the rebels."
According to this witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "overnighted" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "ratification operation".
It was very clear behind him that there was a feeding of small arms.
From Bunagana, a political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fights have entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs who have "encumbered the positions of the M23 residuals to dispossess them".
Since the resumption on Friday of the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fight, but has provided government troops with decisive support in the area of information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, mounted in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket mounted on a new FARDC flaming truck, to ensure the recovery of another machine piling M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to "demobilize voluntarily" under the penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left open the process of Kampala, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hoped to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, but only the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lubala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which they repudiate Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil has the desired mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC, which had set off in the morning, had reversed at noon.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, said to the AFP.
We feel that the fires are coming closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions take over.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical in French asserts itself as a kind of success.
Long time ago, from Notre-Dame in Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts would get stuck in the ridiculous.
And the successful ones like Cabaret or the Miserables were wearing the aureole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to the Castle and Stage Entertainment to Mogador changed the gift.
Today, these two scenes are playing the titles as successful pipes.
The first one, this Christmas, is an excellent My Fair Lady and announces the following creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beautiful and Beast" could well be one of the season's successes.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastil's lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of Musical Comedys" and lecturer at the Theatre of the Castle, analyzes the reasons for success so hard to achieve.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has doubled.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the expense of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Bastille Lovers.
Others make a 15-year-old alliance under the pretext that we can use almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in our head.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Castle that bring us back to life the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser de la woman araignée" or "The Awakening of Spring" are hard to finance.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the music comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
Jobs are many among the regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
As a result, the talent lever is also the number of posts to be provided.
Why are the province's tournaments so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often from the boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
It's these same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) as a show head of a musical show is an assurance of the engagement of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are definitely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise is built in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the Brussels inner ring at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who is compensated for it.
The ring was closed at the traffic, up to 9 a.m., instead of the accident, the time when the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause little trouble because the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child badly injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was severely injured as a result of an accident at Disneyland Paris.
Its vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but it is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction of the Caribbean Pirates.
It was closed to a new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new attack
Children play on a carbon shield belonging to the rebels of the M23 in Kibumba on October 31, 2013 in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last M23 rebel bases near Bunagana in East DRC on Friday.
The aim is to decompose the M23 of the hills that surpass Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which surpasses that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
There will be no more than the Runyonyi hill.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic," said North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku intends to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong place of rebellion, this locality is located at the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred unreductible M23, about 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby locality of Jomba have been cut off.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fights every Thursday all day said that the situation was "slow since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the guard and were buried.
One girl was injured by a bullet, and three other people were injured, one of whom was hit by the FARDC, and the FARDC's strike added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given any account of the loss of human life.
NSA disclosures increase the company's state-monitoring paranoia
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate of Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On behalf of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the top of the U.S. post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation brought about an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of American Information Services, once again in September, insisted that the United States did not use its foreign information capabilities to "throw the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a complainant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by US cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever caused the company's paranoia with regard to state oversight.
The revelation that the phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that had the vessel drained.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between American intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States is as important a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY Advisory Office.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
"It's not the right way to do this," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, passing through farmers.
Except the IT industry.
However, the extent and sophistication of the American spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies that so far thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials are aware that the data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members have given up their projects to use an American cloud storage service provider after disclosures on the American Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data should therefore be stored at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion," said Kurt Bock, Director General of the production company BASF chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally less inclined to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, if this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
For a long time, large companies have been harassing the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional lounge or leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, states that the collection of mobile phones before the council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid during their travel abroad due to the risk of reaching the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access," BfV warned in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to the economic expansion activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out by the United States in February, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, as being responsible for the second degree of economic information piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal information, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a treadmill in his high school gym, think their son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th in a carpet supported behind the grades of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson was dead in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cart, and they got him in a mortuary bag," he added.
US Attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore expressed himself at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll take care of the facts, wherever they go.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was dead by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the county of Lowundes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to return all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
Adolescent parents said they expected video images to contain indications of the circumstances of her death.
The CDC publishes advice on child allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage child food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has increased greatly.
A child out of 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of child food allergies had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the teacher's body and staff on child food allergies, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen self-injector – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative assemblies have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily than epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like I've got something on my tongue," "I feel like I've got a hair on my tongue" or "I've got bites on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of discussion on information
How do you explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side goes off in public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other banning the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian Presidential plane, on the basis of the noise of the presence on his board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is that of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the World's columns at a few weeks' intervals of reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and a condemnation of the NSA's Quai d'Orsay listenings on the other?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral stance, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to fend off an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we believe that, according to American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to get angry with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of technology tools that have been very powerful by the United States for ten years, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have, inter alia, set up procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information, which are described on the one hand and on the other as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can, for example, be guided by the transmission of entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the other hand, it has been said that Americans can provide information to the French about other parts of the world.
Therefore, the underlying issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to have access to interceptive tools, as is the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, finally, the issue of attacks on freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to report them, I don't see how they'll be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have spread.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are, in the light of the revelations, reluctant to entrust their confidential data to US suppliers subject to US law, and thus to the start of the NSA.
The latest element: the widespread movement of revelations undertaken by the world's media, which helps to trigger a debate on the monitoring practices of information services up to now almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersexed children's parents can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female gender of new births will no longer be attributed, strictly, to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children, allowing them to register an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their nutrition, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, contusioned and bluffed.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, the intersexuality of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term that designates people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexual children have an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science that consists of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described persons intersexed as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can be manifested by themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stasis), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have camps that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning his appeal trial that allows him to keep an "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this country had signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is drawn into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of a nurse also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had double sex.
And just over a decade ago, the medical community considered the gender as an ardous, which can be wiped out and on which to be rediscovered.
But now, many are calling into question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can cheat, not knowing how a child will feel sexual reassignment when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children provided with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it could be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut when he was circumcised to make him castrate completely, also removing the testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "repeat this pattern all the time".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations said "they are not satisfied with the result".
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY but with ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical abolition of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he suffered from vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was not going on, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man returned after a testosterone treatment and his breasts were removed.
Surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, is afraid that the German law "calls for labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their children an "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name of the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to this age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "responsible" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffered from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome to androgens.
Because of the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
"The law leaves some latitude for parents not to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This allows them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before entering "male" or "female".
So everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need to do," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and this is something awesome.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the coalition in the power to approach the vote of the Senate to overthrow Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the leader of the left center said that he had "solidly intended" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than partisans, pronounces his resignation.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People for Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October by his refusal to give in to the inactions of Berlusconi, who already wanted to cause the cabinet to fall.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the American Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the firefighting.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call stating "multi-accursed wounded".
"The forces of the order are in place," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a gunfire," said a spokesman for the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) to the AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch card, and a second carriage on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at around 9:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
Los Angeles Times states that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-Scess
Israeli tanks shot a Palestinian Muslim militant in Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in that region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your shoots of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army was pleased to mention a "targeted action" in the area near a well called "terrorist" by the Jewish state, crossed the border and the discovery of which was announced in the middle of October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be leaving Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama planned to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event that appears in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited 2012 campaign book "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the president's close colleagues had carried out "deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's insight could help Obama to re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to the policy correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the high-level campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary-General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect that the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been safely kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors from the president – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina and the former advisors to the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley took the task of replacing Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified as a "concerning" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the reelection campaign had a lot of investment to find out if the change would benefit from the vote.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on surveys and discussion groups unless they're seriously considering taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss was aware of any change.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president "was aware of" the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of whether political surveys had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know that Biden's appearance on the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
You want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous breakfast.
He had the idea after reading a study on doctors and convinced Chinese scientists to re-create the brilliant protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to read when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more light it becomes, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the Ice Society "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language to neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice becomes brighter.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the meds' luminescence is worth four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £ 140.
But she's pretty good at it!
The company at Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of medicine synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai Chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was practicing Thai chi, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and making the famous 21st chi chi movement, with his hands of musicians who blew the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a Chinese martial artist.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband the week before she died, to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had suffered a liver strike last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and drive us to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more thinner.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed a single bonus and I'm sure I won't do it this year.
But the states show that I'm the lame sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in bonuses, decorations and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trend.
Disbursements should be $1.2Md out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexual inanimate objects rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after diversions are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We led our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal clothing this year, according to the NRF.
That makes a lot of curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't get glamorized.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9m on candy this year, according to Nielsen's office.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucetes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy, and we're not going to tell stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Maize beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than the haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 homes officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to America Heights, and this includes these awesome photos of you as you piss on your friends putting on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which type you like to leave a comment in the "good head" style.
Finally, let's talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were playing, and sculpting a lemon in the shape of a lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we've been little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrus" trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculptured these potions and did not have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in lemons, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The latent lemons that flutter gently on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were cultivated this year.

The Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a "bad bank" structure, bringing together 38 billion books (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure to relax its relations with London and accelerate its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of the assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes that it will have cleared them completely in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the depreciation of further suspicious claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds per quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would deliver from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The Bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would enable a treaty to be drawn on the past, with the government in particular being accused of becoming involved in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for the customer and for the United Kingdom," said new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point bunk seats and belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport said: "The rally lovers who meet Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the United Kingdom and the international, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of raid rallying.
We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be palpating.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost jaw after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable frame in a career
Ruby, a cocker Spaniard, had escaped after an accident on the road without gravity
It was discovered three days later by a person who walked his dog stuck in his career
The firefighters came down to remember along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to recover it safely while it was lost 15 m above the ground on the unstable path of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon road and survived for only three days before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared in her career following an accident with no seriousness.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with an acute vision who walked his dog found Ruby on a career frame, 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheaton firefighting house ran into the places and came down with a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal civière to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Assistance Specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance of getting out of it."
She could have been severely injured or worse.
Ruby was led to the veterinarian for a check; her general status was satisfactory, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had disappeared, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters have been sharp.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, said, "We were afraid she fell but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never loved Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was chorist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He loved me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger said he "did not categorically make progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added, "Maybe she's confused with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges a Turkish Islamic movement
"The support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkey based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese security authorities' patron to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party's (PCC) Political Office, spoke at Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a special organization since the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighours of the same family of the Muslim ruling region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with fuel cylinders against the entry of the banned City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of East Turkey, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scottish choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are expected to have an independent Scotland to join the European free movement area in order to join the EU.
And here's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the Hadrian wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the potential economic consequences of a greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not, however, in the major titles (and this was to be expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when they do.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from the Scottish people.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now set: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means the control of passports" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange London's yoke against Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is at last dead.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, the parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and came nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and left the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan that weighs on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has weighed on its members the exchange rates favouring German exporters – what German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of assessing the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public salaries and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the 'green' energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-benefit disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wages freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap US gas.
As a result, the Great Revolution, particularly in France, is one of the EU's major minors.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to deteriorate.
Result: Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the Socialists back to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds it that it cannot go from the principle that a division of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties make a good impression of these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more similar to the "Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" free privilege of General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could preserve the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope that it will take a gentle look at the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific makes it clear that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, in all of this?
We can decide to be a small England region (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending for Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could settle for a more free European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and this is to be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Equiquire, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Age early
Studies show that young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that the hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not also pronounced in boys
The former corresponding CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start to grow to 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as chest mutilation, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight increase in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
"Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Poverty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what constitutes the real phenomenon of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can inhibit growth and a small adult size.
Recommendations on drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "the control of puberty can reduce some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others".
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first ten-year-old rules.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from school, frustrated and troubled to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment or the sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, get their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6-9 years who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards genuine early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even among nutrients and all-time.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that, even if this happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the people of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that just started to resonate before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinemateque, had picked up the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their veil on the star amount of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humoured movie where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to a musician and singer of popular performers, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich aunts of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the beautiful" for less soothing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jury owes it to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" reports on one week of the tribulations of a folk singer who can't beat up and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts back-to-back replacements in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the tour of his friends' sofas who still want to receive it.
Documenter air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mix of mischief, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and prices in Cannes, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on the true personalities of the day like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before Greenwich village's event, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the exorcism of folk music that would generate international stars", as wrote journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes along documentaries, the 33T-enveloped label of dusty music, inhabited by an old immaculate secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the day and to the cafes where the singers took place.
The magic of the Coen brothers is still working by integrating a funny character who crosses the film permanently: a beautiful red chat at the cracking glance, Llewyn Davis's lucky companion.
Asked how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed in blue and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "the chance can also launch someone's career", and "from time to time".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never know the retired word.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years of age, was just about to publish his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it to "the author of espionage novels who knew too much about it".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a 198th and 199th-century theatre in the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, it was also distributed to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, would ensure that the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, was ignored almost a half century ago.
"There is no doubt between 120 million and 150 million countries in confusion," he moved on last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on the Foch Avenue in two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or reported ivores of the 130 countries arpented to place their novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous breast, carrying a gun or a gun.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disarrayed Austrian aristocrat and a CIA contractor to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launched himself into the holes of all the earth's wicked, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a dozen of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a counter that writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters of Albert London, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations".
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet".
"I am always my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," Gérard de Villiers added.
Instead, I meet journalists, including the AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
Suddenly, many of his SASs are often pre-monitored: thus, a month before the attack of a command centre of the Syrian regime that had killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a CIA's secret command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "Caire's plot", a year before the assassination.
In October 2012, in "Bamako Panique", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on Malian capital.
I'm not a wizard, I was defending Gerard de Villiers, I'm just making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these travels in often troubled areas, he set up for a month behind his machine to write IBM to Marguerite dated 1976 "of which all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
On the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly espoused for machinism by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these charges in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome to Africa where I count on many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are wondering about the width of seats while large commands are in play
The dispute rages among the major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-distance flights, opening the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Force Hall that takes place months ago.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats proposed for long-term flights to passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most brokered by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential for increasing efficiency gains in the last aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautics industry to set up a standard with a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as aircraft seek to sell even larger versions of their bimotor long-range aircraft, possibly waiting for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way seats will be available behind the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Force, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of the finances of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in tighter seats than in regional turbo-propellers," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in the planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American tour of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival adheres to a concept of seat dating back to the 1950s, when the circuit assembly of the newly baptized "jet set" was closer.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional inch at the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures regarding the width of the seats and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more and more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a matter that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft controls for an estimated amount of at least $700 md at market price in the coming decades, enough to balance American and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what feeds the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim one per seat performance in their latest models of long-range bimotors 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 original model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this to be able to crash more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing suggest that many passengers speak for a more dense configuration, which can be paired with less expensive rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but they offer a supplier catalogue, among which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who make the world tour even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable equipment, all manufacturers also offer low-cost airlines and regional flights with high-density configurations.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautics industry to establish a size standard for seats will end, but that he might have forgotten the 777X sales gap.
Oracle shareholders angry with the Ellison salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and director General Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to draw the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just as well as the victory of his ship at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that it co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negatively on his salary.
Oracle's boss resigned to a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which lacked its growth goals, but received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole of the marked year 2013, Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5 per cent, while the bond exchange rate of 27.5 per cent, exceeding the S&P-500 index, which took 24 per cent at the same time.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before testing on the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to which nicotine was subsequently given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated "were calmed," the researchers said, signaling that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so often that antibody levels remain high that they were too heavy and not practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies plants.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human-use vaccine was absolutely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotinic vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists reported that the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a coup d'état in Pakistan on Friday.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But those responsible for the intelligence, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this coup, carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The guard, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moving to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been held with Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of the Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi do not be influenced by Obeid
The former New Galles South Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi refused to change the policy of trade fairs at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to know whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids have two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any tenders.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the course of the discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured the balls to make a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, Circular Quay, which reported about $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, was renewed without any call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start in favour of the calls for tenders.
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, demanded a change in government policy in the field of ball.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whey asked Mr. Tripodi.
“ No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we discussed, but anyway, it wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, a leader states
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has taken air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently examining the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers on a visa of 457 while considering extending the repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a way of making his family and friends in Australia.
A government working paper was revealed today while Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it might offend Australia's neighbours.
"Failure statements on "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "employment for the Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper reports on the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others were under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "if the offer of employment is true where the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking".
Businesses may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum applicant would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The injured man's son, 9 years old, was going to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will begin in the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Baroness Transport Minister Kramer stated that the project would "assemble the United Kingdom".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will lead to a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, ranging from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British government, which is talking with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of routes for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling periods between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baron Kramer said: "Our objective for HS2 is to establish a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited about the idea of working in partnership with the British government to examine the options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am eager to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic on-board devices remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to release their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease regulation on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision requiring US carriers to do an important job to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was considering the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft devices," she said.
The issue is governed by a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already told CASA about her intention to extend her use of on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think this would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Quantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will examine closely the FAA's decision and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review of manuals, training equipment, hand luggage delivery programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four wounded in a violent trunk
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of thirty people according to the evidence collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was shaken on the side of Pia, where a riot involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injured people would be sorry.
Alerted, the gendarmeries went on site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore Gage Loans Take advantage of the average classes forced to close the belt
Janani Amirthalinga, at a bank loan on the bank of Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, deposits a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition costs of his daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money went into it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the application is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – that ValueMax, where it did its transaction, became the third banking company this week to be introduced into the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Gazing jewelry is not only a quick way to obtain cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthhalinga – but it is almost as good a market as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's Gagge lenders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above 15.4% offered by the United Foreign Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same business centre.
However, cash lenders have the advantage of not requesting a solvency check or a salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to street lenders while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit fueled by an overly laxistic monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to cash lenders to fill the gap while their economies are experiencing a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency quoted the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the ratio of Asia's highest gross domestic product/household.
Malaysia ranks at 80% of GDP, while the rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the cost increase, people in the middle or down [the wage scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have forced people to put their personal effects into practice to touch the value of cash in their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items in the 200 city-state loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's put on the gold chain of grandmother and we'll find it again next month."
In Thailand, the largest retail store operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is such in the gage loan sector that ValueMax, a store operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like that in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, its director general.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticised for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that gambling offers not only higher rates than other lenders, but also that it does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property that they already own, and the fact that money is their personal property does not increase the debt of households," she said.
The implementation is better and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed funding.
Not only are the people who go to the Gage lenders not just those who have financial problems.
The easy people in Singapore also go to the ValueMax Gage Loan Shops to get gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who need a treasure to get through a difficult head," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council's office.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor served, is said to be deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, he must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes into Nazi uniform at the supermarket before being chased
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform surrounded by a brassard with the gamut cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complained to the management of the facility who called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police the rescue, but "the time it arrived, it was already gone without dawn," she added.
I was making the line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were good-mouthed.
"You don't go out in the street unless you want to draw attention," said a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in the Cambridge News newspaper.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween festival, where it is customary to get into a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canal.
A man in Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brass twice a week for three years at Asda's," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
325 M$ salvation plan for the Tasmania health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, scheduled for four years, was decided after consultations of the government with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties the state is facing," said Plibersek today.
The $325 M$ plan includes a $31 M$ campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2 600 additional operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for clinics without visiting Hobart and Lanceston, with better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for the Tasmanian health system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides the services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Today, Mr. Wilkie said that the $325 million would not count for much "unless they followed a real reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania".
However, he commended the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing the public health system from Tasmania from the black list," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the State, these non-emerging additional procedures will largely reverse the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton's health opposition spokesperson thinks today's announcement is "a lucky solution".
"The reason we're here is that the state's labor government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that sets $300 million, and we claim it's a hard day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicoux of Denis Diderot's novel is characterized by a remarkable artistic direction and a detailed reconstruction of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
As it took place in France in the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by his family.
When she rebels, she faces the cruelty without the borders of a Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Conscious silence of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the monitoring agency
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency said on Thursday, while violent confrontations raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are expected to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also reported on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) came with a day in advance on the deadline for the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machines designed to mix toxic gases and to fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and chemicals, including mutard gas and sari neurotoxic agents.
The announcement was made while the fighting raged in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bachar el-Assad's armed forces were killed, 18 678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops have been fighting against rebels, many of whom are linked to groups in the Al-Qaida network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not specify.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors when they had to complete their mission, which was to clear Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a long-term civil war.
A statement by the IAEA, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied that it had controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production declared and the machines for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being."
Earlier this week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors indicated.
On Thursday, the OIAC said the two sites were, according to Syria, " abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that the IAEA inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the IAEA Executive Committee next month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alauite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and close relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger at the sentence pronounced against the last of the conspirators to be put to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosives used during the attacks yesterday.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for two night-time attacks in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
It was also found guilty of many other leaders of charges of terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia at the Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked that the man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revealed painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On board the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be trained in front of the execution squad," said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other children or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outdoor van, exploded just after 23.00 on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze had a back bag loaded with explosives almost 20 seconds earlier.
He smeared in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, so there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be executed.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Ossama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that reports of intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore ties between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't go," added Mrs. Corteen.
Until recently, he was embittered by the sorrow he could have caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but don't make a call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk about their mobile phone – under the new very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be introduced will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the ordering of equipment for compliance.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies that have already submitted plans.
"According to the plan, we could approve an extensive use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to remove their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not intended to be lit until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are required to disembark their devices on the plane's landing before landing and do not light them until the plane has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, FAA said.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Waiters, said she was happy about these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of being "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So not always from Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out by a U.S. Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was at the door.
And the heavier devices like laptops will always have to be sorted because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered to pose a risk.
"The mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interferences with the navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased in recent years to ease the restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for such prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply because the use of appliances has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget at the time.
New aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by FAA.
Air carriers have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airline aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generation of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who press for ease of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders took over a Kindle e-book reader plane and stole it to see if there were any problems, but there were no problems.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee to understand whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interference from devices was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, which called for sound arrangements for passengers with technology.
"We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passing experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helicopterized after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
A helicopter headed by Aberdeen was mounted on board last month before being set up by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa Rescue Centre.
Central Director Colin Seddon said: "This water stream was probably a winter migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea."
The exhausted bird seems to have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and employment creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the most extensive and complete investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representing all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than join in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arches.
When asked their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from monopolies regulation to product laws – most business leaders believe that controlling these key competences should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of the European area of trade – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more specifically, our investigation with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
Issues are high – to change the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would allow a 16% ballot vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power to return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to the path of closer economic and tax union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means that for companies this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed frieds to hundreds of children invited to the garden of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween's coastal festivals in the United States had been cancelled due to the passing of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the Feasts have fallen apart.
In New York, thousands of customary people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" district.
Everyone's excited, reports one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to wear the suit I planned last year.

People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated in the wake of Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest-scale project," Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, explained in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should allow to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, which transits most of Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the Director adds.
Miller added that direct accession to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries below by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced on Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, receiving information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Mutinies of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy that led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen people, mostly descendants of the Mutinies of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, who lives in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sensitize these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian ZEE, near Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin Province, northeastern China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million pot-wine yuan, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be both intraiable with the powerful "tigres" and with the "mouches" - the subaltern officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former oil giant Petrochina.
The recent most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were charged with sexual assault on children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that it had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a counsel to the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was incorrect by stressing that "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second assessments of four establishments during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had noticed some flaws, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, indicated that she was responsible for child services at YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would lead Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord have clouded their judgment, which makes them not to report their actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the Council of the YMCA of Nouvelle-Galles du Sud, saying that for the organization the lesson from "the incident of Jonathan Lord" should not concern "the signal" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the Director General of the YMCA on Child Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was a "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but he admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his special mission to the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have answered, according to the London Standard Event: "Yes, of course, but it is likely that this will happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations met at Cardiff to face and win the Cheval trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be hard.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the little one and his Shetland Toffee pony crossed during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind 30 other adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style of the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat helmet a little bit on the side in a casual way to show his two-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of little common training for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years old, said: "Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent due."
They presented themselves to and against everyone, but both cut the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were mad of joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and praised it."
He traveled the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be too small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
In the way he started, he will probably participate soon in the event of the Year's Horse – and I'm sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian demonstration said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his ponies."
They're training a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they showed up on the track.
They are looking for an effective team work between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be remanded"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of an accused defamation journalist will be remanded, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted to television that he had accepted wine pots to produce stories about a semi-public society.
At present, the New Express is going to undergo a "full reorganization", said the regulator.
The "recast" order is issued by Guangdon's administration for the Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion quoted company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's drafting was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete re-enactment of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately re-maintain the newspaper management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction engineer named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express first published his excuses, writing that he had not checked his articles correctly.
Several important suspects have recently made television comments.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their views, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to commit an offence themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft in "inaccessibility"
In Toulon, the aircraft is in a row.
The escape of radioactive steam detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear heaters, in mid-October and while the ship was in the sea, was "safe for the marines", but was not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royale has come to confirm the ship's "inaccessibility" until "the middle of November", "the time to take corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DNCS, a defence ship specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, shipped in the Var for the occasion, "are currently on the aircraft".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty heating.
"Everything is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not at all challenge the ship's activity program" to nuclear propulsion.
Let's remember that Charles-de-Gaulle's carrier is lucky for an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had set up Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This is particularly so as to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small accident", surrounded by the reactor boundary space, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I have been able to find a lot of discontent on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, a flow of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to be completed.
Brief, unlimited syphony of our pockets.
Millions of dollars could be saved in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their deterioration.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no shame in terms of the sumptuous expenditure and the maintenance of the canaries: deficit cultural centre, strong subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or they are demolished.
It is also unfortunate to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honour to the transformation of the former Wabasso into an industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not the public level to invest in such enterprises, but the private sector, on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that lakes in the Fish and the Pillars will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the start of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline of the population, the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation regarding its use could be greatly reduced.
In short, it is very easy to accomplish big things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a pen without a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by tielets with beautiful diplomas for most and I don't think a sheep raiser is making it worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the 4 foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag on an equivalent length of nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, to the United States.
The area has indefinable warehouses, which enables easy decommissioning of drug trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were removed by passing unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison for their life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that was part of the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issued an extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "remission notice" against Australia for 40 years, requesting her to present herself to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be liable to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after expiring all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal he appealed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm authorizes his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th, requesting this country of South America political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of resignation against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police station, the date and time of his choice," said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the notice by the police.
Assange is afraid to be evicted from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage after exposing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks fighting secret information.
How Biometry Invaded Our Lives
Finish the passwords to tap to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person who carries out transactions in a world as cross-border as well as the Internet .
Private life protection organizations confirm this commitment to biometrics, but are concerned about this.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms has authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, handforms or hand-to-hand poison networks in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, wherever and whenever," was Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among others, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data is the fingerprints, the hand contour and the poisonous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very weak fingers and their prints are inseparable," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identification field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the poison network and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data in themselves - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
As a result, research has been carried out for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of sensors and the computer calculation capacity necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridar Iyengar, Director of Intel Labs Security Research.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirmed Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Perspective to CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing EUR 90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognise one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is the person who claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already set.
This allows to ensure that one person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We will recover the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who, at NEC France, is responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of a kid making the queue in a store, follow his progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening of a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend who points for another," says Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, in particular those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and large distribution teachers: when paying in store with its bank card, the client does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometric seductive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometry, a customer remains in the box for 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, restorate by putting forward the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Digital prints are stored on a first server; the identity of the persons is in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks itself if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
However, in the absence of detailed studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy professionals, they, continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me afraid of the worst: generalized surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick, Canada's Privacy Commissioner.
A 210 km/h driver with a hot drink between his legs was struck with a fine of £1,000
A car driver was charged a fine of £1,000 for having rolled at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
In Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit led to a six-month leave withdrawal.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs up to £90 and an extra charge for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up London's bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the measure of the capital gains tax but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp for properties that cost more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company rather than individually.
The stamping right already applies to the residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million over the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and the United Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamping right on property of high value and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to advance that property of high value is subject to the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestigious real estate – from 5 to 10 % of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in southwest London, located from Fulham in Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in the centre of London show regular year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a "internal market" in full growth, the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a resumption, according to Savilles' studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs removed their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs removed it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in incentives that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs' disordered tail movements, researchers have followed animals as they watched films containing other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs of the films of other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression remove the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view who removes the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a tail turn mainly to the left (once again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other because of these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet several times in other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail towards one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will respond to this experience."
Researchers indicate that results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavioral expert John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, stated that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their head to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He pointed out that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or dogs robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, identified in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs do not make an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with her singer.
Sheffield's group was scheduled to take place on Friday in The Hydro concert room in the city centre.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the Birmingham LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to report the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We wish to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope François will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope François will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22nd, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so François will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of a pope – so this is back to a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops would be exalted to the dignity of cardinal, known as the constitution.
"The Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February constitution in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinal electors would probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed so many cardinals that it was necessary for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and more cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The composition of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to prefer Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40 per cent of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided all by himself.
"Now François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "very possible" that François asked for advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes were generally elected by bishops representing large communities in the cardinal's rank, but that François was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he's going to name".
GM remembers some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the headquarters file
General Motors Co remembers almost 19,000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with hand-to-hand inclined files, according to a Friday statement by the US vehicle safety regulation agency.
On some pickups, the previous seats could be faulted at the level of the tilt mechanism.
Consequently, the files do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the back, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injuries," according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statement.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the launch of vehicles most important for the first American car manufacturer since his failure and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the default pickups owners during the first fifty October.
NHTSA has not been able to examine the owner's information letter due to the 16-day end of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickups Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by approximately 20% during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 silver pickups and 16 503 Sierra pickups.
The GM's share rate increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A deceased worker buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place at 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the area of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I walked by the car and saw the wall crash with a big cloud of smoke," said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the building.
I'm off and I'm going to take out the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the 50s who worked for a hairdressing company.
Reanimation maneuvers have been attempted by emergency services, but not successfully.
Man has not survived his grave injuries.
An inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety of Work has been deployed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the drama.
The cry of despair of a Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been made by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a horriblely sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win", and it is the memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I'm asleep, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and when speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a devastating victory and news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young visionary team was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transitional period prior to its appointment in 2008, it had 82% of favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, such as distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I put on Obama's credit for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor does the prosecution of prosecutors who reveal the government's flaws.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the avoidance of public funding and the overexpenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are "more aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Clearly, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that were meant to be spoken for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index sank under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back through this book in 2008.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have flown.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses for the benefit of Clinton in the Pennsylvania Mayors.
At a follow-up meeting, he told his team that they needed to return to the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place in Retinne Street in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fléron, didn't wear helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of the relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest regarding the parental leave system.
MEP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and enjoy this system.
The magnitude of mining extraction, which challenges the payment of a 6 million dollar carbon tax, has argued this argument to try to resolve the issues of a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit from these policies personally.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after re-enactment.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of resetting the suffrage disposal system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote has been concluded?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why couldn't we have a system where you can enter, capture your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 in the morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it possible to delete the result if someone disagrees?
In our day, having a paper pencil seems amazing.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek any reward except the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of forest dolphin outside northern Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) comes to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new dolphin species surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Furthermore, it is not possible that such advances in genetics and molecular biology would cause a species to be classified or belonging to a species, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being called into question because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two very close species were morphologically distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific pine dolphins and the Atlantic pine whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known by researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this area.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have a case of extinction of a species, rather than of a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or extinct according to the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility to be restored from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has grown, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located on top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This bridging of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in the search for life on other planets than in marine research, and it is a long time to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the change market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its market division from two sources near the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of currency market manipulation begins to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5.3 billion are changing every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the extension of the investigation that leads to the Libor interbank manipulation scandal.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from the regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had sent instant emails and messages to and from an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his European trading position for the currency in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European trade manager in cash at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted to take action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma stated that he was investigating suspicions of market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong – are examining allegations made regarding bankers that would have been heard to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks are leaking instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
News of these investigations has broken down traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limit opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market for highly liquid change, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to begin to have a low-cost impact on the market".
The new arrived the very day that the Swiss Credit announced that it had returned a trader working in its office from the funds negotiated by the London Stock Exchange this week after it lost $6M last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation on Mayor Rob Ford has been grounded, a lawyer says.
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said he had never seen a "so bad" investigation.
I told Ruby to believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion regarding the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they had also observed this man issuing packages to Rob Ford, stating new court documents.
But Ruby described it as "inexplicable" because the police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or listened to his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and conduct a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have required an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as a "evident and desperate attempt" to appeal to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference, on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European scholarships at mid-term, with the exception of London
With the exception of London, the main European scholarships evolve on Friday to mid-summer, led by some news from disillusioning companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Furthermore, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could deplete its quantitative mitigation policy sooner than planned.
On the contrary, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street presupposes an increase in US action, after two consecutive rebate sessions.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest echo of CAC 40, led by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after also publishing down this morning's results and announcing the creation within a "bad bank" of 38 billion books of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is headed by EuroFirst300 in response to press information that AT&T is studying a possible OPA.
On the change market, speculations on the evolution of ECB monetary policy are going well, as John Hardy, a Saxo Bank strategy, points out.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro's decline.
In this context, the euro continued its rebate against the US currency and reached a meeting of less than two weeks at $1,3517.
The same assumptions support the euro area's mandatory market in reverse.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today stated that the Health Reform Act ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual term of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government's taxation authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold should be reduced to Medicaid under penalty of losing all federal funding of the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates for the high-ranking presidential election during the 2012 primary elections, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute given to former combatants in Menton
At the heart of Trabuquet's cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute on Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Mme. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Interconnection between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night, during a violent clash at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday 1 November after its fuel stockpiles were exhausted, the Palestinian enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a carnival gun at an Israeli army invasion in eastern Khan Younès, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants conducted a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a armed bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres inside the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abou Zohurri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell in defense of the territory during an invasion of the Zionist occupation in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," the spokesperson threatened.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the objective of its operation was at the outset a section of a large tunnel that had grown in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and was, according to the army, destined for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them with Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military communiqué explained.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," Peter Lerner's army spokesperson said.
In addition, Israel hit an air force base in north-west Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles to the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, October 31, the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
An American officer confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," if he was happy to add.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she had not named, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing targeted a load of air missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chuinard, who presents in Dance Dance her two new group choreographies: Henri Michaux's first inspired encres and poems, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Sati.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chuinard, art to ticks and black ink to white.
A white screen served as a back wall.
On the carpet, so white, in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, progresses, profile, finish like a line and a black dress, a body.
On the screen, an encrement by Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simply treats, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a thread of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, rush when the next graph appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in group at unisson (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each executes its signal.
It is thought of "Glorie du morning", where, in solo, Chuinard performed a series of choreographical tasks written on posters, placed on the front screen.
It's the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, beats and electric guitars.
Energy is high, speed is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prayer escapes under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro by hand, without sovereignty or retention, a part of Michaux's poem, monocorded and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to share, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if possible, ends up suffocating and obsessive.
As well as the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chuinard - like those hair that buoys up or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of the work of Michaux, was imposed, with his ticks.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's ankles, like Gestalt's forms, open a wider and gibbousy imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers affected by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience loved it. The reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, are richer.
The scene is partly gray flagged, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers relax to play the scores.
Their music disorders, touching, give real fragility.
On stage, the couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition soils, sets that move, colors, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also family members of Chuinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivals, runners or players.
The gestuelle, the laughter and the little screams beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the coyote bodies, of the beings that are found.
But the room takes its real envelope after the rescue.
A clown comes back on stage when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotine dancers descend among the spectators, glamorous, smoking, short-circuiting, playing codes of applause, the sauce is thrown into a completely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
The joy and madness are inspiring, and it's the art of Chuinard, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of old Nortel patents has started an avalanche of court proceedings in respect of patents on Thursday against mobile telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he ran at the pot when selling patents that took place after Nortel failed.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for violation of the patent before the United States Seating Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow you to display advertising in relation to Internet search terms, have indicated the process's conclusions, which is Google's business heart.
It was not possible to contact the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose $4.4 Md.
After losing Nortel patents in front of Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 Md, a partly-based market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the investigations, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," said the trial's conclusions.
Rockstar claims more important damage and interests to Google because he claims that the violation of Google's patents is persistent, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
My grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a housing in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty hot water, said on Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The on-site expert at the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
My grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and burned violently.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the LIEGE CHU, she was in a helicopter, in an ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came down to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
He was able to join the ground floor by the stairs intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were weathered by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Archese police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt requests the President freely elected to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi has borrowed the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his triumph day will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president to succeed Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 judges of the Court in black robes whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better futures, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the live public television ceremony.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the United States, from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-pressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclamate the new president and, as the Presidential fast of the years of Mubarak, the traffic was only interrupted briefly to allow the passage of his convoy to the very frequent streets connected with the city centre to the south bays.
Considered as the little charismatic "refuge wheel" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his speech on Friday, during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to finish the work started at the 2011 uprising against President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red tie, addressing the judges present in the forest room where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Colonel Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." enchanted by thousands gathered in the university's large amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and former foundation of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fifth of the groups of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended in the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers, which the military council, which replaced the former President-in-Office, had defeated.
But by accepting official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he bows to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States has slowed the increase in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers, five of the six main performances were lower than expected.
The three major constructors of Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and adjusted sales of seasonal variations, but the market was set up at 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake blow is primarily explained by "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first fifteen months of the month".
However, GM reported about 16% of its sales to 226,402 vehicles last month, compared with 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14 per cent over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
On the other hand, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140,083 vehicles, against 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also display lower sales than consensus, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM took 1.4% to 1635 GMT, while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault led by Nissan's warning in Burse
Renault accuses Friday of the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced a decrease of almost 20% in its annual net profit forecast, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a change of direction.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a manager of the trading of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a location of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was severely injured on Friday night by shots of fire shot by two people who were on a motorcycle passing by a location of the Golden Neonazi Party in the West Bank of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Abue members had argued that the victims were local guards.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Néo Iraklio Bay, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Adobe MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league games of his club, against Ajax and the Milan AC.
Exploited against the Barca for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club was called "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in black, Monterégie with 13,464 and Ottawa with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also knows its lot of pans with nearly 7,000 private power houses in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think the travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net profit forecasts to increase and expects record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a underlying benefit over the entire fiscal year between $325 and $340 million, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If the current forecasts are met, they will represent 12-17% of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 M in 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of the benefits in the first semester and that the second semester had begun in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are well on track to achieve record results on the whole of the year before deducting interest and tax," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure sector has rebounded during the second half, which has made it possible to compensate for a low domestic market for business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His subsidiary in the United States recovered his losses during the first half of the year, where the seasonal application was lower and had to benefit from the entire fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people are shooting at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unidentified people opened the fire this Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent queer with licensed employees.
Assassinants fled, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif, stated.
This attack occurs while Egypt has received almost no more tourists since the army deposed Islamic President Mohammed Morsi at the beginning of July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be deleted.
As of 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programmes tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key materials next year.
In addition, Offqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will reveal a reorganization of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, i.e. 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students do so for about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, close sources from the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance given to the materials in international rankings – would probably encourage schools to provide more hours of training.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will come into force.
An octogen hostes children with a gun in Muy for Halloween
The nine and 13-year-olds made door to door to claim candy at Halloween's evening.
One of Muy's neighborhoods visited by children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the cops that he was afraid.
His weapon has been seized.
The former leader of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common graveyard of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of German Resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common graveyard of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily heavy-duty by relying on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great Enemies of Postwar.
The German secret services, the BND, would provide as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely misdirected.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body has been found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich's Aviation by a commando," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were especially his service states with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district mayor of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal sadistic Nazis is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it's a lot of bad taste.
"A heavy crowd of victims' memory," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He participated in the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was, in particular, under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in the mud, the jungle and across the rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend watching hundreds of patients
There are few doctors in this West African country, almost 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heroes CNN of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him "Heroes CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father altering his periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and going to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We'd have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to hospitals and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they've been waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditure is carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And it has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes into rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, with 30 people, they settle in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to go to villages that need the most help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and energy flowing – is more than happy to join the parties.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people every visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they walk.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive bees, a pair of bees collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a mayor or a house; after the intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the wake room to leave his room for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electromagnetic group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's a steady pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work," explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year, and knows that their presence can make a difference for those to whom they come for help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to care for a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works nighttime in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still at the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nurses such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have at their home.
"We were able to participate in operations to assist in the spraying of blood or to transfer the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the chance to do in America when you're studying medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay for their journey to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonese people is not close to spreading.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve the pain are the reasons that motivate me to do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long been pained to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and gyms?
No doubt, but by stressing its low for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrator of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but ignoring the editor's hidden work and underground writing.
Inheritance of the screen occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great educator, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he would show little inclination to produce it himself.
To this image the monument of the "Memorial Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
Bad languages have been able to see a huge market in the pussy, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a lively eyebrow and the mind of education, but incurringly dilettant.
The two works published by Nora soon after two years have already established that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book here should make him absolutely just.
There is, however, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabonding, the retirement to jump as on foot from subject to subject to one another.
But it is quickly understood that the missing objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the broker back to one and the same passion: the discovery of the constituent node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is a matter of time.
Little by little, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders back then, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not become an heir of an eternal franc, he refuses to define.
Concerned analyst of a family stranger, he is mistaken in a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by an object in the form of a receipt, tortured by annoying questions.
This one, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently installed in its borders, so formerly charred and solidly grounded, are these dramatic calls to unity understood?
They are not so pressing, says Pierre Nora, but to conjure up the confusion born of the contradictions of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Burgugnons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that ends up in two national stories.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; concerned about finding the sacramentality of it, and so much greed for unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one who was the evident and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between the left and the right, secularity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To feel this singularity of the French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France each made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, and wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cuisine only makes it better to highlight what's clean for us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer cared.
Here, men in charge of an ancient indigenous regime, and much more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when she was here sowing the drama and confiscating it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are the former revolutionaries whose models are hard to make, and who are still intertwined.
There is an institutional constant, and here is a collapse of constitutions, as well as so many errors to catch and attempts to resume.
France that's leaving, France that's coming
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could pick up the clothes torn from their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this third Republic, central and creative time, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was unfortunately preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only been for a while.
This is again being debated, prompted by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of disadvantaged minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the sketch surrounding France that comes.
With, first of all, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the fireplace was a chancellor.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The highway was located in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, here for more than a half century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have finished doing so.
Certain in a less sharp, more fragmented and subtle form.
But let's not be fooled, just as binding.
Because much more than the required figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner need of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Removed from Beirut on March 8, 1986, with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation in 2004 of the "Ottags of the World" Defense Association, which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
In custody for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of the Val-de-Grace on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to find their families since.
And try, slowly, to resume the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Otages of the World".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it makes me black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very inclined as well.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They're laying us on the side of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first series to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is always there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in a helicopter, we took a private plane that takes us to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua sails.
How did your arrival on French soil take place?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible shell.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty.
The descent of the plane ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorbike takes the mud to take pictures and follows me to my home where I have to do some police to stop some of them from going up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We're out of a hole and we're all suddenly under the media fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The night itself, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begin a sort of life rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two, which are a bit like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing occurred?
I had the right to first medical examination in Corse.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and meets with a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything but we know that we can rely on him, remind him so much, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of the Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The discussion on ransoms, among other things.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I try to share the issues between my past as a hostage and my presidential casket of the "Otages of the World" association, which allows me to distance myself, and it seems to me much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting with others for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify for "political" hostage hostages - most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why should it not be said to the hostages "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimate, struck with the right sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and that shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Angry rage in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi was opened, they went down the streets.
Mobilisation throughout Egypt to claim the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
It is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brothers.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial involving a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Faces broke out in Alexandria, the police used lacrimogene gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized the homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with it", the Minister in New York recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to spouses of the same sex in the National Guard facilities" established on their territory, he denounced, accusing those States of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implementation of the National Guard of Texas, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by India, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of the gay marriage to about 5,600 active persons, including the National Guard, the Reserve and the retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by SK8 Unity of the Pump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations shall be held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., before the expected end at 3 p.m. and the fixing of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical advances of young people who, for some, already attend the highest level competitions, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen, and he likes nothing as much as to show off to competitors who exceed it with three heads.
The mayor of Toronto hunts journalists who come to him for a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested man, Rob Ford, has always refused to use crack while recognizing that he has a pen for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased out of his property several journalists came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday, October 31, that a case of anger had been detected in a caton in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The caton was found in Argentina on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of anger was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and support those who could have contacted this caton between 8 October and 28 October," states the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the cat have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"For man, the preventive treatment of human anger, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective," says the communiqué.
Departments are now calling for persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin damaged by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with that cat between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of anger since 2001, this caton or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "autochtone" of known rabies dates back to December 1998 on a kidney and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog from Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated on time," the departments recall and it is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama is taking a step back on its reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise without any ambiguity and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health care, you can keep it”.
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of resignation from their claimants, the Republicans criticised the president over the past few days, accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance can keep it," he said during a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called "an effervescence in the present" about the resolutions, President Obama urged Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health schemes at the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 per cent of the population who are contracting insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately".
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm eager to regain your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this sentence, while she believed his micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the meeting of the Assembly yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obama.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has insisted on asking Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up the government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now belongs to millions of Americans.
Vettel extracts a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy choice, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 World Champion, was amazed at the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his ecuity.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion close on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was to carry this helmet on Friday and Saturday, to the trials.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Banlieu Party
Let's not be fooled.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermune, his founder, the "Parti de la Banlieue" is not only addressed to the Banlieusards.
I chose a map of France as a logo.
When I talk about banlieu, I address all those who are excluded from the large national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in its native municipality of Aubervilliers, is born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural pot mixing that characterizes most of the neighborhoods.
My proposal No.1 is to create a department of multiculturalism, please indicate.
Abdel-Malik Djermune, 50 years old, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my programme are attached to the left, but if the people on the right are ready to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its program - consulting on the Internet - from many themes intended to talk to the Banelieu people and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the building guard function...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he acknowledges."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Banking Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that he already has seven lists in Metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the e-mails I have received since yesterday don't all come out of nowhere" he is pleased.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "was too far away inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a rediscovery of the defensive attitude of the United States towards his surveillance programs by admitting, without any precedent, that on several occasions, the espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate manner".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been governed by "automatic pilot" when a series of fire-fighting revelations by the complainant Edward Snowden on NSA spying activities came up.
Escapes have put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is clear that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course, on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that the US espionage had exceeded the borders, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far wrong."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people what was now being done for a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry stressed that the NSA was a force for good and that its supervisory operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and arrest them before they act?
We've done great and well prevented planes from falling down, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we've been able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of the Connecticut stated that he had spoken in front of Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain by our side in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the European Sub-Commission on the Affairs of the American Senate, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with certain U.S. allies, but the Agency's Director stated this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it was metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and from 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Information Services, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the itinerary remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to prove "intimidating closure".
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been applying for years.
"We can modify our surveillance programs to better protect European rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the chain created by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, led by Shell's bad results and the next day by the Fed of maintaining its economic support, as planned.
An Australian uses his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for allegedly misbehaving by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15th of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled it, had attacked her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commissioner's cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre in Phuket's area rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of the former Australian rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra's Department of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's welfare and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously lived a painful moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after payment of a bail of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that it was waiting for vacations in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they prevented the appeal from leading to an extension of the sentence that could last up to two years in prison and a imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket de Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reduce its deterioration in the image of tourists, which could lead to a rental.
French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came in otherwise than with RSCA's cars
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-Middy Police Area, announced on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this meeting of the League of Champions will have to use the movement system established by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesman said.
The progress will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture reported that measures had been taken to ensure that arrests or custody were carried out," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Courgeoys School Commission
At the Marguerite-Burgeys School Commission, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
That is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horses between different cultures.
The school committee has just revealed its vision of "Living together in French".
The Vision of Diversity has been a year in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common clues that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our sites are landmarks.
Large names of writers, artists, whether of origin or of origin.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are created so that they can identify themselves to all of this," explains Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we see in the student clientele," he listed.
The Marguerite-Burgeys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Various educational strategies, this is the real need," she said.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its corners: language, school, social and cultural.
