Semilars against the Prosecutor's Office: the execution of former Deputy Mayor Tartu will be examined on 4 August
This means that a decision will probably be made in early September.
The Courts of First Instance refused to consider the Semilarski claim, but in April its cassation complaint was brought by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, since its authorization was not within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for damages caused in criminal proceedings.
“Such matters should be handled by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Court of First Instance”, explained Annett Creatsmann, the press secretary of the Tartu Court.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski had appealed the decision in the district court, which had not changed the judgment of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now you have to say your word to the Gossud.
According to the lawyer Semilarski, juror lawyer Oliver Niaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of hostages for about two years.
He now demands the Office of the Prosecutor to reject false allegations at his address and to compensate him for the moral damage he has suffered.
In October 2017, Semilarski, together with the other deputy mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained for suspected crimes.
“Remember that when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor ' s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole of the Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local authorities, were sold.
These air - suspended public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it," Samilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor ' s office should operate.
"Affirmation of trade marks and sales has proved false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia and Lithuania that, during the investigation, representatives of States should be cautious in choosing words so that suspects would not be represented as criminals before the conviction.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Nies said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and defendant in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be inadmissible, contrary to the presumption of innocence and injustice to the complainant,” the lawyer added.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, former Deputy Mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be held accountable for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is accused of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions of particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017 the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city administration meetings in the decision-making process of Tartu companies with owners or managers of whom Semilarski was actively involved at the private level at the out-of-work time.
According to Grosse, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests and therefore he had to refrain from taking part in the decision-making process.
Earlier, as Rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had made semiliar suspicions of receiving bribery and violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions of particularly large sizes.
This happened in October 2016 when he was arrested along with another Deputy Mayor Artema Suvorov (Centrisian Party).
At that time, the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against the two vice mayors.
After that, both officers resigned.
The case later came to a court of law, which fully justified politics.
The trial of the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.
Ex-soldier of the Hands Up group visited the Tverska area

The singer is likely to rest in the beautiful town of Tverska, along with his family.
The residents of the region had already thanked the performers for their visit and expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroška" in the post is probably about the new version of the old song that Zukkov now wrote together with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
Most fans remain for the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Give me the handy fans upstairs, "We don't need a new little."
Most people would write directly that the original, which in its time became a hit, would like it more.

How the decision to reduce the key rate affects the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It was still 0.25 per cent, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual formal historical minimum.
In view of the return of a short step down the rate, as well as the tone of CB statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon be stopped.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that the risk of inflation declines from 4 per cent in 2021,” reported the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiulin.
They relate to a significant reduction in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiulin, will take more than half a year.
It noted, however, that, following the withdrawal of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had been revived: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment, increased construction and release of consumer goods, slowed the annual rate of traffic reduction in transport, promulgation.
According to the CB's detailed forecast, the reduction in the economy in 2020 will be 4.5-5.5% (amount to 4-6 per cent) and the recovery growth in the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, 2.5-3.5% in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices up to $38 and $40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the forecast by the Bank of Russia for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, considered economists for Russia and the CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donez and Andrey Melaštenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced its key rate over the years, which has dropped by 3.5 per cent since the beginning of last summer.
At the last meeting in June, the CB immediately reduced it to a single percentage point due to low inflation rates due to the overloaded demand and the need to encourage the braked economy due to the pandemic and its associated restrictions.
The opportunities for money-laundering remain (at the next meeting of 18 September and before the end of the year), but the border is already close, agreed by the main analyst, Rosbanke Evgeny Koshelev.
The aggregate of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a break in the reduction of the percentage policy - the disruption of supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
In order to complete the follow-up to the Bank of Russia, more attention will be paid to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to external volatility, which is growing in the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In other words, lowering the key rate will lead to further lowering rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, in the case of the mortgage, says the senior economist of the Bank's analytic management, "Opening" Maxim Petronovic.
The adjustment of rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he said.
Demand rates may fall by more than 0.3-0.6 per cent during the second half of the year, and mortgage rates may reach an end of the year in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, not excluding the economist “BKS Prime Minister” Anton Pokatovic.
In his view, the average rates for contributions would also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now just above 4.5 per cent).
They can also be reduced to 4 per cent if the CB reduces the key rate in the fall, Pokatovic considers.

She doesn't tolerate things like that.

Question: Lithuania's ruling Christian and Green Union again led the ratings of the parties
The Lithuanian Union of Crusaders and Greens, which is the head of the summit coalition, has led the ratings of the parties.

The authorities of Sub-Moscow told us about the fate of closed landfills
In Sub-Moscow, landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being modernized in modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for each location -- many of them have grown densely.
Once the polygon is closed, it becomes re-cultivated, the body of the polygon is shifted to the ground, the exhaust and infiltrate systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes to be stopped inside the trash so that it does not burn, do not dry, poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-con goes on to raise a useless dog among its surrounding habitat.
Why don't you do something useful out of it?
For example, in Roosevelt, where the restoration of the Annan polygon has been completed, the authorities are considering making a mountain range from a mountain range.
This polygon, operated from 1976 to 2016, grew beyond the borders of the land under it.
It was therefore necessary to buy neighboring sites, which had long been de facto trashed.
"Sometimes it's going to take a while, the polygon's going to get stronger, and we're going to think what we can do to get him to take advantage.
It is a top-level resort," the head of the Russian District of Nikolai Parfenov told reporters.
Two polygons will become renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo sites in the Lubercah and Timochovo district in the Bogorod district will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from natural and biological gases.
A gas power station will be launched in Torbeeva by the end of the year, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalorie of heat, which will provide its own needs for the site – heat supply of administrative and production facilities.
"Timochovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment complex.
A museum may be set up at the Balashino site of Kucino, which was closed after the people's complaints on the Straight Line with the President of the country.
"It was such an idea - to create a museum for the reculture of the Podmoskovya polygons," the Minister for Ecology and Environmental Management, Dmitry Kurakin, announced.

According to Dettereva, the Havarov region cannot now remain without a leader, so President Vladimir Putin has been appointed head of the region, so that “the remarkable building (the government of the country) has worked, everything has worked, the budget has been wasted on social needs”.
The Governor's time explained that he had not gone out in protest before, because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he broadcasts and reads all the comments to them.

Beautiful high miners only decorated Ayah Sofia
Aya-Sofia is a text about Vladimir Zelinski, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance, a ura!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's House is better free entrance than pay.
Second, the Muslims had won the land as honestly as the Orthodox had won the Volgo-Oksko Intermediate, the Muslim Caucasian (and set up a church in Grosno) and had planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans won America.
Are we going to give it all back?
You don't think there are any Gentiles who will need to return their chapel to which the Tenth Church is located?
Third, Muslims have improved the building, invested funds in it.
That is, it belongs to the factories and premises that the peasants have chosen from the bourgeoises to own their own, the Lenins belong to Putin and other denominations.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so that's all that's right for the progressives.
The beautiful high miners were very decorated by Ayah Sofia, very.
There was a stupid blacksmith, there was a stupid blacksmith with beautiful minerals.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" and "justifiably" civilizations.
Some of them are believers, some of them are hypocrites, and some of them are hypocrites.
A believer in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
It's the idea of a British Indian officer named Toynby who believes that it's embarrassing to think that way.
But as for him who believes, a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray except to be removed from where he is asked to go, and he is kept away from there and he prays.
He is a man who believes, and does not defend himself.
We're dolls, not rocks.
