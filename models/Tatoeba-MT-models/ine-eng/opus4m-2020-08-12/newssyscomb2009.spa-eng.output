The right-wing populist triumph in Austria, together account for 29%
The early elections to the Austrian Parliament have resulted in the first approximate results, the appreciable weakening of both major coalition parties and the express strengthening of the right-wing populist party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian Popular Party (OFP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphal return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with 29.8 per cent vote, thus losing 5.5 per cent vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still is the GVP that loses 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of the votes.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic results, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war war, and especially for the people who convened these early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP left the coalition, people had a considerable advantage in terms of preference to the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations on the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer have been made.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This development would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, i.e., the renewal of the Great Coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the strengthening of both sides of the right populist - Liberals (FPO) have won approximately 18 per cent and the BZO, one-hundred per cent of the votes - and that the social democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would happen in 1999 when the populists negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 they joined the BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a European Union sanction.
For this evolution I clearly bet Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to cooperate with any party and has already taken his turn to Vienna, to national policy.
The Green Party has also managed to reach Parliament, although it has lost slightly and has come down from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the limit of four per cent and therefore is not part of Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can cool
If it is not possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting rabies, it could lead to a cooling of the Czech-Indigenous relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is how the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, expressed himself.
"If this was not solved then yes, then yes, it would certainly arrive at this cooling," he noted after the meeting organised by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive could hardly be involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of charges and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the case lies.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, the best would, according to Mukherjee, be to appeal to the highest courts.
Then he could ask for an exemption from the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then the pardon would be possible," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can enter the matter is by obtaining the convicted person's "legally competent support", the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support was already achieved by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg commented.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, his colleague stressed that the Czech Republic considered the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a huge mistake to incarcerate and condemn these Czech scientists," he announced.
The Minister eluded the answer to the question whether he had received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
"I've got enough promises," he just said.
A Czech arbitration a battle in the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, which represents Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and alongside it also the seabed surrounding it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and the Sea Affairs.
Her boss, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, followed the exhibition and sometimes the complete one.
He governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides to this day a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms still carry the key to the development of anti-cancer medicines.
The fund is larger than the solid land
The coastal countries have today started to strongly dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these benefit from the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Border, which is sometimes extended to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Board.
"Simply, the continental board understands the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred miles of sea, that is, a pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the purpose of delimiting the outer limits of the Continent Board should be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
This is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance commission.
The Commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries have emerged," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its maritime domain.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission gave him last week was 1.6 million square kilometres, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit that will be lost from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They may do so up to ten years from the date of ratification of the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border ends, the region of the oceanic fund declared by the Treaty as "the common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine," says Director Mikulka with emphasis, adding "that its areas are legally and clearly restricted and its contractually defined regime."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries from the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as several other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to investigate for the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is an accident, it's about something as well as a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," adds Indian lawyer Pashi Ryan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concretion.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who, according to legend, was reviving Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the command of German special forces was at the scene of action
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help - experts came.
When the situation was serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being provided on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the rescue action, German special forces also participated indirectly.
Thus, the German army and GSG 9 officers were on the scene of release, including federal police aircraft squadrons, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office, as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As spokespersons of ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, aware of a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
" Fortunately, that moment has not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travellers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian and 8 Egyptians.
After the kidnapping in the southern region of Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was unknown to the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of liberation.
At first there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Build", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the air forces in Germany and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with a large bailout of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government's bailout package on financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the disorder should be limited in financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the democratic negotiations, had asked Members to vote, although the plan was not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened at all," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or to 600 points.
The reason for this was the concerns of investors that the State rescue package could fail.
At the end of the vote, and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts have other serious disturbances in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the volume of sales of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared with last year - even the winter season in more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel from Germans remains as before.
As the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin informed Monday, with travel reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost 11 per cent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results is GfK figures, which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the whole market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, most of all travel to the United States is of great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost one third.
Germany's preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Above all, organized trips are very preferred, Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV, explains.
In view of the increase in energy and food prices, in this case travel expenses are "better calculateable for the customer than during an individual journey".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well reserved, so the volume of sales compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, comparing last year, went down.
My first October party
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Balneiro, the beer in jars of a litre and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian fashions by designers.
A debut in a campaign shop.
Actually, Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's rude, the moderator on TV and she's wearing a traditional cotton suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already used.
But there's one thing that unites us: we're just in the campaign shop, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it's very lisonary above all because I'm the first time in Octoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian dress seems to perform its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Octoberfest from northern Germany, my sense of well-being with a traditional Bavarian dress to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Teresa Prado everything isn't for that.
Almost everyone wears traditional cotton or leather pants; no one seems to be giving up or feeling uncomfortable - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my delant receives rare sights next to a banana stand in chocolate.
"The left-hand side is single, the half is the virgin, on the right-hand side is engaged, behind is widowed."
Oh, God, now I'm opening behind my left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care much about the subtle methods to flirt and carry hats where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and they show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist manner is called Bob, he's from England and he's also the first time in Octoberfest.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which speaks with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his bottle of a liter of beer next to him.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most think it's a trash cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
Others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
At eight o'clock in the night, health care groups run for the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitaries appear in groups - all of a sudden there are always four people who bring the covered streets from one camp to the other.
This works like most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunks.
No one can see who suffers from alcoholism and is in the streets.
"They are those who "can't anymore," a health worker answered my question and disappeared in a hurry.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in the county of Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in Brentwood, was involved in the accident at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of neglect.
He's been released under bail ever since.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Much before Turkey agreed to be a member of the European Union, European powers were driven by the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, there is one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to watch the end of the platforms and leads ahead two towers, one for each corner, all of which resemble a typical German municipality.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the tie was over, there was no doubt what the size of the company was that it was the most Western door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railway that was being taken to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, fell low
British domination and when the forces moved to Egypt, they pushed Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then the station has fallen and remained on the edge of history.
But today, this railway, doorway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Government Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Hamas and Fatah Palestinian factions, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Turkish capital of Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert in foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of looted, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to govern a new secular state, away from the past autumn.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmical change in Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspicions in the West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping centers and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business - men and women - meet at first thing in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
I wear, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time towards the East and the West.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both things.
"But certainly at some point," I ask him, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he answers, "does not want to face that choice."
He then stressed a point that almost everyone I spoke to so far had almost memorized me: the relations Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the station of Hydarpasha, after a second night without sleep, my thought comes back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt that the continent will be to which this fascinating country must claim.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: which musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (that, September 11,) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As part of the music project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sang his finals in 1979, several of us were finishing the 20 years - we just refused to give up on the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changing form) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music that was presented to him, be it madrigal or Messiah, whether not accompanied or with a complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this choir of young people was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's all you have to do!"
Her varita was always absolutely clear and precise, although never taxing, nor too flowering.
Whoever was the musical squeak, always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a knight, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by anyone – otherwise, I have been inspired many times by them.
Tod Handley had this rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two war horses very well known throughout the world."
We're gonna miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his century of William Woodruff (September 25th), he states that "the economic history studies in Oxford were resumed in 1946 and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by Woodruff's author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, a season during which he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
It spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York universities.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to ignore this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flemish and Life" because their pictures in white and black, documentary style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second attack on Honda Survences
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If your predecessor already had a large capacity, this new single volume has an even wider inner space.
To all this, refined mechanics are added, which increase the comfort of driving and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of the revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
Before analysing the new model, however, it must be noted that this new Jazz is six years after the first generation was introduced into the market.
One first observation is, therefore, that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter period of time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, about one million Jazz units have been sold since their launch.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would result in 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of the total sales of Honda to Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish branch expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to much pale the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, which means 4,000 less than in 2007, a 16 per cent decrease.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, its market share in Spain has increased, reaching 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
The Japanese signature also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quota trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - from which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year around the world.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior also grows.
This profit is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the central fuel storage facility, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - also rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are of the engine 1.4, since the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - as well as external elements such as rear leds or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are an improvement in access to rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, in front of the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
They are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will have two 1,2 and 1.4 litre gas propellers.
Both mechanics incorporate the i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high pair throughout the engine system.
The first 1.2 litre mechanic obtains a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum pair of 114 Nm. to 4,900 turns.
This propeller - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a cost of 5.3 litres and a emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propeller, which in the previous generation had achieved 83 horses, it now becomes 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents Nissan has been inspired, this time, in nature, in particular, in bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as a basis the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that assumes the first step in conflict prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Security Shield of four Nissan areas.
This robot intends to strengthen the capacity to prevent collisions of vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space in oval shape that looks much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important are the compound eyes of the bee, able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles up to two meters within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately translates into conflict prevention.
"At the moment when you detect an obstacle, the little robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels in a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is completely instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot turn upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels, not in infinite directions and ways such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot avoids collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
You do not need to store information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so you can operate continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about memory gigas, not even megas."
This is the first step towards developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan Vatican will introduce into the series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the way.
Time before hypotenuse
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not ingenious.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on trash mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created an ameno and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the Lions.
The main aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think about one, two, and three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
True, he has useful information, but little detail.
It is more a page for adolescents than a site for all the public.
What if the game is completed?
Well, there's a bedroom inside the hotel.
Something's something, 'cause buying a better house and talking...
Morgan Stanley sells participation to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay off $9 billion to acquire 21 per cent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low rate of its stock exchange.
One week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25 or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, ensuring a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be based on a price per unit of measurement of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79 per cent to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
" This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," explained Juan Mack, the director-general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would allow him to diversify his activities, but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
The arrangements presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that he would sell up to 20 per cent of his shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
" A week ago, he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, " we thought that participation would have been made up only of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley’s securities 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20 % of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUG may within one year convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold by more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at $47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow you to take investment opportunities, strengthen your balance and increase your liquidity.
A spokesman for the group refused, however, to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15 %, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan must have relieved his balance from the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, who saw their quote in a bag down half while the cost of security against a risk of defect on their debt was defraying.
This cost fell back on Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the break-up of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refusing the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example, your colleagues and friends, is the third person who voted on a draft for a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, "no" reached 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the more than one suffrage had to be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the polls and a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to "yes", estimated between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed in a devastating way " had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians who headed the Government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague, Mikaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution entails an increase in the State ' s power over the economy, while retaining the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through the exchange of foreign currency.
led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of State, which can carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa had already announced that she would use this power and propose a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives under the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 persons kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the wilderness arrived ill in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by the special Egyptian forces in Chad.
They all had a good look at their arrival at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to the Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a living suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are well healthy" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On 19 September, these hostages fell into the power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying a safari in allergens in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and from then on they passed from zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organisation of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night before dawn.
" An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half the kidnappers, the others have fled," said the manager who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "relapse" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commanders.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said without entering into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
In the evening the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrestrial on board of whom the kidnappers were found, of whom he killed six, including the Chadian chief and detained two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-U Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement that was immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes manchettes and takes up the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will be raised to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national famine - stricken historical sites?
What politician would dare remind the federal government of neglecting its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did the French government know that it devotes three and a half million euros to restoring only the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of property is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec's History Societies, at least 40,000 charitable people regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about finding in history, preserving with little money a lot of private archives and preserving archaeological vestiges.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is seen in a hurry due to the effects of the mortgage crisis on the US market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has business in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competence.
The Fortis Bank is the first to have suffered the crisis in the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that is taking place in several storms over a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank can, in a sense, be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three States will purchase approximately half (49 per cent) of the property owned by the Bank in its area.
The Bank will certainly sell part of its business, including most of the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
The actions of the Fortis began a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to point out that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to collapse.
The company's shares fell by 12 percent only on Friday, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current prices of the shares, the total capital value of the group on the market is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank's management has imposed the sudden fall in Fortis' actions to the uncertainties of the US market in connection with the approval of the US package plan of $700 billion.
On Monday, the actions showed a slight increase.
On Friday they appointed Filip Dierckx as the new director general of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously ensured that investors had no reason to worry, would not lose their money.
So far, no panic has occurred among the Bank's clients, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch office in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the data on the purchase of medicine.
Privacy policy experts fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which in all cases link the use of revenue data to the approval of the person concerned.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the asshole" - quote Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription monitoring program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They previously sent the customer to medical checkpoints and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number, he easily gets the list of medicines bought in the last and half years and the program itself concludes on the customer's illness and health status.
For example, if you take systematically high doses of pills to reduce cholesterol, it indicates that the fat level in the blood is practically incursibly high, thus you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the program, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company, in addition to the administration, has only something to do, although there are few difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is that some medicines are multi-use, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even to antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, requested the patient ' s approval.
The authorities are already obliged to do this, although they have not been fined for neglect so far.
Some companies have recently also developed the results of the laboratory tests and, by combining them with drug consumption data, obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and healthcare providers.
There is already before Congress the bill that gives the authority the right to control of companies specialized in the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard admits that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the person's specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such person cannot deny his approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the pig.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are each other's trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other problems in general, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic developing power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Head of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade exchange.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious objective.
Thus, the twenty-one existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, so air transport can also fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among the Union's trading partners.
The summit gave its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of it - and welcomed the convening of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the trade liberalization round in Doha was also welcomed, although both parties were heavily responsible for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will adhere to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 per cent.
India also agrees with this, just as the next year's climate conference should reach a global agreement and decrease by 50 % by 2050 the production of greenhouse gases.
They also wished to impede the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris trusts that the French companies will receive charges of EUR 20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a 15-year period.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
The presence of Italian editors at the international exhibition of the book of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian editors present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international sample of the Frankfurt book awaits this edition of more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the sample with more than 403,000 titles in exhibition and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the Italian pavilion opening ceremony: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with an Italian point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A press meeting will be held in the Room Structure on the 5.0 flag of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives on the state of publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of foreign authors' books decreases progressively over the total Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, the millionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying over the Nevada Desert.
The trash has been found on a height of 3,000 metres, in the Nevada Sierra area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Commissioner of Madeira County, John Anderson, has noted the still remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is itself the one that Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance" has said in a press conference.
The Commissioner has stated that no human remains have been found on the plane or in the surrounding areas.
The millionaire, 63 years old, has been killed in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the remains were observed, a team of researchers who identified the device has been sent: it is itself the Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since 3 September 2007, when Fossett decommissioned Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, the two issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweat.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had acquired a position in history thanks to a long series of awards.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world tour into an aerostatic globe: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world's turn on plane and without scales.
Among its memories, also that for having flew 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schematics with an original and well-established design with defined lines and specified angles.
This, in summary, Glk the last born among the all-earth "compact" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a new window in this sector.
Owned by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms since the next 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the debut of the new car launched an unpublished mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominates the central street of Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication started with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How will it be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car leaves the poster.
Next, through the use of the innovative Light8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be answered in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of car communication with this advertisement.
Will you be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula?
is clear who are the Italian hooligans
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sporting events is being played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys from whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Altras Italia" that has been in Italy for years and that has never created too many problems, so far, in truth.
And they had never met the fans of the rival either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia have been added to these in Sofia.
They have three-color flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fanatics.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
Figc had made 144 entries for the party available to Italian fanatics: all with names, so it is easy to control.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo (banning access to sporting events) at that time, no one who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, rejected the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior now expects to read out the acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fanatics who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) which prevents not only the Italian stadiums but also those of Europe as a whole.
Our hooligans will no longer stand in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty others are added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they say from the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, "well-opened eyes" especially in view of the National Party of Wednesday in Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Cams, who can also count on a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems themselves at the stadiums.
"The crowns of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...."
This is Domenico Mazzilli's thought (expressed in a poorly happy way) for a few weeks, the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of Interior (has taken the position that he was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste's public security where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics who have been ashamed.
"I don't do the sociologist – add the Observatory No.1 – the rats are assigned to the countries where the event takes place.
So far this group has behaved well now we will see what has happened and take this into account for the future.
But let's also talk about the silversmiths to Mameli's hymn: they're not a crime either, but if they're allowed, they're not educational...."
