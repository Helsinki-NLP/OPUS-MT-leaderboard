I'm not sure yet.
Do you want something to eat?
Is your hope doomed?
That'll certainly attract Tom's attention.
Tickets into the museum cost $30.
Do you want something to eat?
I work in Tokyo now.
Tom has lunch alone every day.
Let's defend our marriage.
You're not busy now, are you?
This room has its AC.
Why don't you help him?
I got married when I was 19.
Didn't Tom really know how to cook?
Where's the supermarket around here?
Tom's hair's been washed.
Can I ask for something to consume?
I've done anything I can.
Please wear your shoes.
Tom's always good to me.
Where did he want to go?
He's a DJ.
We shouldn't have let Tom know.
Have you had dinner?
I was happy when I read.
Which house do you live in?
I want to learn your language
I want to go have a drink.
When are you going to go?
Why could Taro speak English like that?
Let's just do it now.
You're spreading false news.
What's the matter?
I was expecting you last night.
You just made me feel so happy.
Parents are wise.
I was sleeping when Markus came.
I can't hold my right hand.
I'm hungry.
Yoko didn't answer my questions.
Tom's very different from his father.
Like father, like child.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Tom pointed the floor.
He's been a very good man lately.
He's from France.
Tom knows he heard something.
Health is more valuable than gold.
I will be glad to help him.
Learn about the foreign culture.
When did you start using them?
Tom wouldn't like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to call us back.
Without hesitation, he refused to give up.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
The knife's too thick so it can't be used to cut the meat, I finally use my pocket knife.
The blind side of his eyes.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's forgotten.
Where are you?
The passing-beams are used to set the passing-beam.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room has a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me some water.
I'm used to not interfer.
It smells really bad.
Words are words.
There is no god but God, and there is no god but He, the All-mighty, the All-mighty.
I just found out yesterday.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My sister likes music.
It's very easy to hang out with Tom.
You want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this afternoon.
"No, we're not waiting for two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this signature for the rest of my life."
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never be able to find your way home, through a narrow stone road.
Tom really wasn't at home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy's driving the car.
It's a birthday card that'll be here soon.
Please read it again.
When do you get it?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I went too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has already included payments for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn the logogram, do you?
Tom was trying to get Mary to help him.
Two things are not connected.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I stayed at home because the rain was coming down.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
To me, there was no fundamental difference between the culture of the two countries.
He's got a fight.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
That may have affected their decision.
It's raining for the whole night.
Tom started to be jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy you this bag.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever gone to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready yet.
Mary refused to accept the invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
He's sitting around his grandkids.
The boy was sleeping in his bed.
Jim's not used to driving to the left of the road.
He's focused on those challenges.
That man died a few hours ago.
You want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak to Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We've got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying by plane.
I thought he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I couldn't finish reading this fat book in a week.
The choice of a time is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of supplies.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked all this way, I met a woman.
Can't you speak English?
In front of all our laws are consistent, but the rich at times have more advantages.
He must have made it.
I like cats.
It's almost over at nine o'clock.
Tom's mentally disturbed.
Maybe I'm crazy?
We faced a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made a mistake.
You better tell Tom not to.
My mother hasn't been here for ten years.
No one's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with his car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coupon?
She looks serious.
Tom married a woman that was easier than he was.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself, but in the end he failed.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I reincarnate, I want to be born again as a cat.
We get a lot of rain this summer.
He made important scientific discoveries.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill hasn't come yet.
Laurie slow down.
They suggested he go alone.
Tom's a good guy.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom cheated on Mary.
Not less than 40 percent of students go to college.
Tom put the brush on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom shook his voice so that no one could hear him.
Did you see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is he hair long?
He greeted her every morning, when she entered the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
The seed is very hard, better off on the left.
We don't really see that accident.
His mother was worried about his son.
What's the opera showing at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel like I'm tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
The data is often not accurate.
Get up!
We've ordered a six-and-a-thirty.
We named that dog Tim.
He quickly opened the letter.
Where's the train station?
Tom told Mary to follow him.
It's time.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knows her will be amazed.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The car's just gone.
They're crazy!
