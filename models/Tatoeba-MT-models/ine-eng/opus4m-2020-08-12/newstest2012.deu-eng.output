No free Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to abolish the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted under a bill.
The new regime that could have opened the way for the release of the Detained Minister of Experience was rejected by Members at the second reading of the application for the mitigation of the penalties for economic offences.
In October Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding a allegedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid, in December the appeal of the judges is to be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as the political root of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the Court's primacy.
The request, paragraph 365, on which the Minister of State was sentenced to withdraw from the Penal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan Dinar
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in an unknown place buried in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the Islamic elections, the question is only which - the moderated or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council was familiar with the customary right of Shari  country, from which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft you just hack your hand.
Women should also forget the thought of emancipation as quickly as possible, and possibly faith-sponsored, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Koran from mutually dominant tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order which would hardly be feasible and, above all, hardly be desirable.
Only - our way of life is now not the only and objectively seen, perhaps not the best and would hardly fit in with the above-mentioned Libyans.
It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves from the unbelieving dogs at all.
Their apology must only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not conducted by any general from America, but by God himself, whose power was praised after every successful hit.
The victory in Libya?
We took part in only one shooting, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians fired themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from Libya's military occupation.
Thus the Heissians are concerned - that is, the scattering of the crusaders.
Do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Well, hardly, and so the West can finally boast once with the right of its independence in matters of protection of human rights.
If this doesn't destroy the Shari-a representatives.
The start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy was stagnant compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market is clearing up all the records.
The investors not only retain Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which is 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% rather than predicted 0.1%), while France had a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data were only about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the analyst's predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this third quarter compared to the previous year, however, compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal estimates, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of the analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The income from its 10-year-old state bonds is reduced by 28.45%.
The income of the Italian and Spanish state bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to experience problems...
The return on Czech government loans is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany there are votes to be taken, the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well laid tortwart Czech and a beautiful tower by Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football has been able to defend its luxurious origin from home play and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise in a detailed report.
Low excitement in the first half and a giantportion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also triumphed thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happily 1:0 and thus redeemed her ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defense of the Czech team, they could only put the Montenegrins under pressure in the second half.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant odds.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed next year with the European Championships, it is also happy to receive a prize of about 200 million to the home football.
From the first minute on, it was played quite combative football.
Both teams combined long and long and thus were played mainly around the centre line.
Also in the second half of the day, the pressure of the home team remained out, and the far-reaching defeats from the police were successfully rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core programme.
They made a living shield.
A few hundred high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday.
By doing so, they wanted to make sure that they were ready to protect their country's core programme, if necessary also with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has not given up its efforts to nuclear weapons for a long time.
In Israel too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed on the afternoon before entering the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack carried out in the intention of placing the Iranian nuclear programme largely under the control of the Israeli press in Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would also be the target of the attack, according to the Israeli press.
The menu of a fat-sucking child: It does not breakfast and eats for the evening break Wurst
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys show that adipose children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for a person's healthy development the environment in which he grows and the examples surrounding him are.
On the tables of adipose children, herbs are up to half the frequency on the table, than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had on the eve of the enlightenment action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes for dinner break.
In families with Dickers, sports is not just one of the favorite jobs, however, with the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents have time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not an accident", supported by the General Hospital and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand of the 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horrifying increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, started to eat, five times a day, in breakfast-second breakfast-food-vesper dinner mode - one of the main conditions for healthy nutrition," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and breakfast for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as regular family breakfast, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students breakfast.
And - in most families everyone breakfasts for themselves.
The worst was the finding that is not breakfasted at all in every ten families.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of healthy daily food.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, there is a much more frequent consumption of unhealthy potatoes.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is only 15 percent.
Build up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to draw up their own food plan from the possibilities offered to them.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 at the point of nutrition is far from the ideal of healthy nutrition.
Among their favorite foods were many flour, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming in particular," the final report on this survey stresses.
During lunch, i.e., the main court, flours were hardly able to fly.
The children almost disliked the fruit of the trees, and even the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Reference to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they receive proper information.
"In the control group of survey officials who completed the questionnaire after completion of the clarifying lecture "Adipositas is not an accident", in many cases there was a clear shift in preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are indicated.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed much more frequent birds or fish in the questionnaire as the main court of the day and were willing to eat less nuts or sweet foods.
Claim professional - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introduction article about how to learn stylers, I had tasted a little that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't realize what's going on.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this "on the spot" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination takes, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully covered.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (the course does not involve a single man) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's always the most of us.
They have one too short neck, the other one too youthful figure without regular curves and again others are moldy.
It is the thing of the stylist to cascading wide shoulders visually, extending the neck or embossing the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bus, wide hips and narrow waist - nice and figure concrete without acting all too provocative.
For example, if the difference between size and hips is so large that the rock or pants really do not fit, you should be able to cut at least one piece to the extent.
Surely you will not regret this, for good sitting clothes are simply non-refundable.
In such a tailor-made rock, you feel much better than in one of the rods, which is always too high and rusty, in the size, etc.
Young figures can once again afford to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, stickers or scraping.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid it is almost impossible to create in view of the homework it has been assigned.
Each of the participants was awarded a promi for which they should consider suitable outfits - day clothes and avendrobe.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm going to "draw" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice because it is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos lately (well, that's a bit overloaded), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the pieces out of magazines or search the Internet, print them and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist draws the models not only purely physically, but also designs the product page in the journals (by concrete default, e.g. trend handbags, cuffs, etc.).
The designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about the types of figures, was launched by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorny, fashion designer Jakob Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variable.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the Jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear paragraph shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to raise the sleeve or collar and at the same time the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he said.
But most of all, I found the following advice: "You must know the rules perfectly first."
"You may hurt them first," said Jacob.
Finally, I will understand why we have to dress up all these teachings, what you can do with what you can do, and why, even if you often get a whole different look in fashion journals.
Silence from fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different among them than in reality.
So with all of this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
The fact that the image and style together make up half the success, confirmed us as well as Jan Pokorny.
There you only need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer who made a world star out of the image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known individuals often think of this as wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if anyone of us is able to stylise, then we should assume that he or she is probably pushing us a completely different (less) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to Google to find out for sure that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned or withdrawn, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist would focus only on fashion and then the outfit needs "to be built together".
In his work he must primarily communicate with the people he silences and must be a devoted psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and standing up to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sit on their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can't clear the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can carry on with it," says Mario.
He also showed us very concrete what must include a so-called "plattach".
So there's a bag that you buy at the waist where you carry all the necessary properties.
Besides such clear things as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains tools such as a nylon thread (to help the stylist in photographing products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is worn if it is too large (stick needles or other adhesives are forbidden so that the fabric is not cut) and of course close.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is straight, you can damage the shoe sole, keep the outside quiet.
Oh, we glued and we glued...
Don't even touch the shoes with the scarf so you don't hurt them.
So you really have to act properly.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we got at the second weekend course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to dedicate yourself to the styling at professional level, is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride will be completely avoidable by a series of dilettant errors to the routine of the morning.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful is that, obviously, no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the Ladentics, the new part with the title "The Run" raised high expectations.
However, he promised that the already-old series "Need for Speed" would move a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstrations he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the custom passes, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and goes on foot.
But the way you're used to NFS is in the end much different than you expected.
Safe - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game of some redundant errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no errors anymore, but rather signs of an incomprehensible failure of game developers in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition or across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you're going to drive - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be run on a different course and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment the impression that the game would always offer the same again.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snow landscape seems very pleasant.
Untypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm, which greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains again, you need to be careful that you are not swept away by a maze.
In addition, the individual races are built up quite well.
Just a few, but they're enough.
One time you try to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classic race against the stopwatch), then another personal duel is expected with a single opponent.
And that's also what the police are trying to get involved in.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
Rather, it is some interactive animations in which Jack runs ahead of someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game there are much less such passages than one would expect (specifically only three).
Finally, this is the matter rather to the advantage, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it belongs in the context above to the elements that make the game more varied.
The model runs in the treads of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it doesn't expel trees; on the other hand, you couldn't claim it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations needs to look elsewhere.
But an action-driven race is still quite good at this driving model, although you could find better at the competition.
Until then, everything's all right.
Real problems only arise after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated distortions and collisions, but if you don't notice anything about the way the car behaves, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When you're overcoming or preconceived to the opposite cars, you're "stretching" the other car in some places just easy, in others, almost identical situation, but you get into the loops and turn wild pyrouettes.
Or it's driving the car straight to the junkyard.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't make any difference, it's all angry.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back at the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you've run out of it, it's all going to go away.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't leave it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't even help the restart, it doesn't help anything other than learning the critical section from the head.
It is said that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be run in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't pass through.
Otherwise, you will always encounter "civil" cars at the appropriate place in the same configuration, whether you come as first or fifth, five seconds sooner or one minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contractor is passing by before a player on two opposite cars, but before you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to walk around them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you always get over the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The crazyst is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in opposite directions.
The contractor obviously has to get out of here in hell.
And then if he's in front of one, he'll naturally take a look, so you start driving your own car there a few times.
Sure - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this purpose is so clear that it quickly loses the joy of the game.
And that's too bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is all quite entertaining and rather so action-loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads is anymore.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't take long, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You must not overlook the tanks on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limos for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (hereafter challenges) - that is, the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (hereafter challenges) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, various items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results achieved with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible cuttings is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you arrive by car in a subway tunnel (myway) where you rest in the dark on the rails long (myway).
On the tacho look figures between 150 and 200 km/h (my way), but there comes a subway on the one hand and leads a uncompromising junk.
In our editor we will probably still have a long fight about whether it was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors keep us so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
It's so much more annoying that in some exciting moments the image repeat frequency becomes slower and this, among other things, is rather dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound is so much OK and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a la "from everyone" was created - but who buys such a game for the sake of music?
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn't fooled by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have said with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But this is how the game seems somehow incomplete.
To enjoy a class for yourself, but one should be prepared to overlook one of these errors with the power of airport shippers.
Concert of the "Students of the Universal Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
For the third time, the Festival Festa Academy has already offered the inauguration of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this as well as the musical experience.
In the course of the festival they present themselves to the twenty-one vocational and higher education courses.
The focus of the festival is the two concerts that will take place on 17 November.
"The Karlsuniversity has a large share in the festival."
"The Choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities is also represented among the participants, and also the Rector Václav Hampl sits on the Festival Committee," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organisation team.
The festival's absolute highlight is the public concert of college students, which will take place on November 17th from 2 p.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program contains the composition of the important Czech Jazzer Karel Rožička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours, the concert "Students of the Universal Revolution" (Student Sametu) will take place in the galarooms of the Vinohrady People's House, where there are also high school students, not excluded from the audience of the Karlsuniversity.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the world student day but also to remember the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present public chorus music at the highest level and to promote creative cooperation between young people.
The main organizer is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with Johannes Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital of Prague and Václav Hampl, took over the whole event.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to concerts, the course includes numerous music meetings, student-happenings, matinees and other events.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions tangible by lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to start."
"It will take five, six years until the cars are smoothed and everyone is accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her speech at the Faculty of Law.
As she took the motto "Intellectually and openly about Europe", she had already shown in the first part of her speech, in which she managed to describe the individual bodies of the EU and its mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have used so many lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was said to be too inexhaustible - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say, it has struck all the breath as well as he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to the twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them, and to have clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", which is an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda that the European Union lived, lived and remembered in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial and gas crisis and also held the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency meant that it was a major negative which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do with all its hands.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, which is quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether there will be a modest and cost-effective budget, which will take precedence over economic sectors, which countries are more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Irrespective of Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's a cruel spell, foreign words, and professional jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how do I really want to know if you're really curry or round gums in Brussels and think about various big bananas or if someone really wants to ban us from the quargel.
It would also like to use the EU's land to obtain more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called Eurosceptics, who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The fact is that the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is much more angry.
Many factors are due, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, so-called V4.
"Believe me when a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slowake is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you doing together with your heads - this is your V4 again?" and making it a pretty acid mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, in future the EU expects, above all, strong rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European Federation", it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries away from the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for Strengthening Cooperation."
"It was said for the first time that only the countries that want it and those that do not want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, according to the whole issue with an impact on the EU as a whole by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovative IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most precisely characterizes the strategy of IBM, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, which is known as a modern company, although it has disappeared for a century since its establishment.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless world problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" was thus a sign that the life of the future giant should play (and at the same time as the title of the internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the fundamentally prepared corporate culture of Watson.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thought means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a century because it remained loyal to its principles and was not afraid to change everything else around.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, to transform technologies, business and society as well.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company for the occasion of the anniversary.
Translucency system
Watson has already operated social care for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Batàa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid leave, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a comprehensive pay system for the best newer and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are also tricky.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and could therefore choose.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is changing at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it has adopted the position of the Head of Transport, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstorms in recent years, many of which have led to future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unsurpassed position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of Consulting Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo for the family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all U.S. technology companies, IBM owns most patents, and five of his employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, strike code or the diskette.
With some 220 billion dollars in stock (market capitalisation), IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple) this year, with Microsoft overcoming for the first time since 1996.
The Preview
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the experiment with their own OS/2 operating system, the Online Service Prodigy or also the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not emotionally bind to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
Unlike the anti-soft player, which in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
IBM’s profits are mostly services, software and hardware involved in one fifth each.
In 1990 hardware still represented the highest proportion of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008 when the recent financial crisis for the first time was like a storm around the world.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the authority of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the middle of the great global economic crisis.
So far, the company IBM seems to be facing the current crisis undamaged.
The value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's profit continues to grow.
The company log of IBM is: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM history: From cashier to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They have technologies such as the famous slot clocks for recording the beginning and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of this new company, who also had the chairmanship in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, started, as the name already tells, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cashiers.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its turnover to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was in charge for 40 years, only then he was released by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM of NASA helped fly all - to Mercury and Saturn and also to the famous man's flight to the moon in 1969.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the Consultant's share of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus went fully into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It incorporates the intention to use technologies wisely in previously unplanned areas, for example in order to improve traffic and urban management.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932 IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class top research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová via her untrustworthy gates:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband, Joseph Rychtář (53) from the patron of Iveta Bartošová (45), became their lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life she has made clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said Dr. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová, the singer I. Bartošová, had offered to take refuge in her own house, she would probably not even have fallen into the dream as it did with her husband.
When Iveta pushed her back 30 days later, she went back to Ríčany, and Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even knew publicly that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, even though it seemed as if she wanted to make peace with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář does not care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive unopened arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, confused old ass, but as a person to whom I still have some ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and existed on her own on mutual consent.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door on him, Joseph still bears dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, it doesn't change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I'm perfectly normal, just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm clear that it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take any responsibility.
The worst women's misfortunes: How are you?
If men are asked to call some typical female infidels, then they will without exception shake some prompts out of the sleeve.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines where we let a couple of unsitting Revue go back, who let men get the blood in the veins?
Buyer's search
Do you suggest to them that you be competitive?
Do you have to buy at least one hater a week?
Would you like to go shopping and may there be a little more at the same time?
Well, then it's really a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their appetites under control half way.
But hand in hand to heart, which woman does it already hold out looking for a well-sitting dress just by bambling through a dress shop and not just try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though buying for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how often they've told their husband - you'd rather stay out...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I had to take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Is this something familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are legally possessed of what they look like.
This does not mean that you should go for a long time, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly laments her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a fight against windmills.
Brush windows, wipe tiles and dust, rub the bucket - and this at least twice a week.
Do you mess with your partner because once again he slips dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you crush the children because the straight-cut wash basin is already drunk again and because the glass door on the living room has yet again fingerprints, where the polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer under this kind of "deviant", then you should know that you must not overstep anything and the order and cleanliness in your family life are not at first.
Finally, this immeasurable level of cleanliness can also damage mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Stick
"Sweet shift pants come in the sink."
"Do you really want to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't just throw on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyranny, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course that's not bad, they just want everything to be fine.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to make so much money.
Clatsch and Tratsch
Some women would like to chat and chat, where they are swapped behind their back or even embellished or forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to focus on such issues as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of a harmless clutter and tratch in the camp.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with clutters of the greatest calibers, whose nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and pose a significant danger to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with her assistance in victory
The ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the NHL's Monday game with two assistances on the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and was called to the best player of the game, was a user of the nine-and-thirty-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assists in the same game also listed Jágr's partner Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game against journalists, he has a great evening prophecy.
"Even before the game, I'm telling him that he's got a hate trick today."
I kind of felt that way."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," said Jágr, after which Giroux already reached a gate at the first shot of the pilots.
A bit later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the door of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
One second before the first third's abbreviation, home player Patrick Dwyer obtained a short handle, but the second third belonged to the pilot again.
It's certain, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he achieved his third meeting, followed by Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the League, but of course he's one of the best three," Jágr praised his center.
"I wouldn't mind playing with such an ice hockey player to finish my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates put their game on me and now the spear is turning," said Jágr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Rutua and once again Dwyer, who was going through a fine, came to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was in excess of two against a successful one.
"Excellent performers still worked in our area."
"He picked up the puck, I picked up the ride, and (Read) moved to distant places."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it hit," Voraček described the party's last hit from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech opponent of Montreal Jaroslav Špaktoek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and separated himself in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candians, in addition to their experienced Beck, also provided their leadership with an unforgivable shot at the Penalty 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points pained the coach of the home team probably the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defense players at the end.
"That's bad."
"The meeting we played with only one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do, so we have to be done with it," Jacques Martin said.
"In every change, one wave of attack after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech tortoise Ondřej Pavelec fired thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended with a series of five downfalls, five different shields had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel offices approved in the then ČSSR: Čedok, athlete, CKM, recreation and car tourism.
The travel offices at that time sold mainly only travels to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West only allowed selected ones at that time.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a pro-western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovak).
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel offices also offered travel in the West, but they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or have at least "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
Even so, the matter has not been going on for a long time.
The so-called currency use - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free exchangeable currency, so without currency use it would have been impossible to drive the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs therefore spent their vacations in the interior, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekends and desks - a habit that lasts to this day.
The entire 1989 revolution followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
Until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A powerful paradox, which you are no longer aware of today, is the fact that you could not travel in the Czech Republic's most popular holiday country until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s last century, the foreign currency obligation has been lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough time from their journeys to the West, each wanted to be there for at least a few days.
This is how the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have already had the money for a hotel accommodation or a pension.
A typical feature of travel abroad from Czech Republic was then a full-packed suitcase with cans, beer and durables, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living, as well as the averages, are increasing, which brought 1997 to another important point.
Due to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to prepare regular trips by charter flights, thus allowing flights to negotiate quantitative discounts, which were unbelievably agreed upon in comparison with the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had foreign-exchange payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-office" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying every year in distant sunny countries; this year you are flying directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel in exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States raised the visa requirement for Czech tourists, so our country was definitely among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 tsd. CZK per head for a single holiday stay including the costs of the holiday.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again threatens a pact.
For almost five months now, the Czech Football Association (FAČR) has no president and threatens that the successor of Ivan Haszek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be even known after the extraordinary summit on Thursday in Nymburg.
For to this day, there is no agreement on which electoral order should be chosen.
And without this there is no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Haszek, the old querells broke out again between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be very sharp and clear on 16 September when the new president should be elected.
The delegates of the main assembly had, on the contrary, come to the People's House in the Prague quarter of Smíchov, because the negotiations resulted in no result and it was not just the election itself.
In fact, it was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the meeting - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with a full power.
In this single point, at least in part, agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, according to a representative of the State, was not in place.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee further clarify the matter at which the agenda is in principle nothing else - whether ordinary or exceptional - at its meetings.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how should you proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statute or whether a different model needs to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate wins the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is applying.
Mahren is apparently willing to compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side is on the condition that the winner receives at least one third of the majority in this percentage vote.
"Then the two fronts have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole twin room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Matrician side, which was best placed not to add the electoral order, but to choose according to a valid statute.
Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even though it turns out that the statutory electoral order of all the candidates is against the most probably Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the time is chosen after the statute."
"That no unreasonable alternative be devised, as at the last main meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time was a candidate and was limited in his opinions to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburg and he believes that candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for the football-EM today would certainly contribute to the comfort of the mothers."
"If the football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three fans, at both professional and regional levels.
Rijkl's in the back.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of the trees and the marshes, but there are some efforts to "advise" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a new blockage at the Main Assembly is not excluded."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally wins," said Rijkl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides will not be left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rijkl should fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and in this way the search for a replacement version of how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the Barrage game was hot.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties into an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the credibility of the Czech football and also the forthcoming ČSTV headquarters, which will show the new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paklík is going to fight around the president's position because he doesn't see any suitable candidates.
If Tomáš Paclík, the leader of the Pilsner Footballers before the extraordinary main meeting could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have taken up the fight for this top position.
"If there was a good defendant, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adjuvant," said Paklík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rijkl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paklík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will only remember the President's function for a year, i.e. until 2013, until the end of the General Assembly.
In the position of the president, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too busy in football.
"I've spoken to some of the people who are in question."
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football right now.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paklík allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the President of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at major meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable that Pelta should have the president's position.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and the Czech football would not go forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a smarter businessman, is twice as bad to football," said Paclík.
He also argues that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interviews to investigate a corruption case, but was found to be punishable by the Pelta.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we be there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club when Pelta is president", but he sees something left behind.
Should Pacík win the Thursday election, however, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rijkl, who had supported the Pacík prior to the main meeting in October, thought that it ended with a failure.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He's got great skills."
"For example, I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he was able to lead the union as manager."
"But I don't care about matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of it in September, that he was at the top of the Dagmar Damková after the appeal of the judge's commission with Luděk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the chairman of the association has grown.
And he relies on his ability to run private companies, since last summer he is also the chief of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and disciplinary commissions, which is even in adverse situations," said Paclík, who does not make any cure from his antipathy, for example, against Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he looks at the strengthening of the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political top politicians for more money from the lottery tax to sports.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new president should devote himself to."
"If it comes to taxing gambling as political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to cut and say clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not consider Paclík as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the president of the FACHR must be "over-shared".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rijkl with the Prague Dukla.
"It's not exactly perfect."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club apparently to a third party to return after another half-years," Pacík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR that would rule out a patent situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the President's office, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make himself strong in the event of his election that the FAČR will receive new statutes that will in the future exclude disputes over the electoral order of the past.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburg and believes that the election struggle will surely be intensified if the Czech election succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last Main Assembly and thus allowed him the two-month break to help defend his ideas on the leadership of the football and to introduce himself in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is run by someone, says the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who also acted on Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
For this reason, he also believes that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that ruled at the time of Ivan Haszek is responsible for the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the main meeting was approved in June of statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a president from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the main document of the Civil Society that he used as a means of closing for the delegates.
"If I should become president, then I would take up his personal responsibility and be willing to assume personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"It's a basic thing without which he can't be," claims Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his competitors.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rijkl, whom he recognized because of his legal education and well knew that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Even Tomáš Paclík did not attack any longer, which again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to some successes."
"His attacks were slowing down, however, and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who may have remained faithful to his proclamations that he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this is supposed to be the sign on Czech football.
"I would also try to put an end to all affairs - from the Cause of Bohemian, to the posters of the corruption scandal last year."
"At the same time, I would go through negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure adequate funding for all football," said the sixties-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry to the top of the Czech football will not mean personal cleansing.
"I had to trust the work content of all the employees only once," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervously reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming main meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburg on Thursday.
"If it really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and he only wins it back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the day of his possibly decisive career.
Rijkl promises that the FACHR will start working hard under it
If the former vice-president, Jindřich Rijkl, was to be elected the new president of the football association of the Czech Republic at the main meeting on Thursday, this would seem to cause a lot of people in the league to miss out.
Rijkl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and to continue the work that former President Ivan Haszek started.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Started by international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on national selection, professional football, and performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rijk in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the football can take place in every segment with milestones."
Many would not have been thrilled about this because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, consideration was given to no longer running.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't necessarily throw a knot between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he delayed.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently it also motivates him to continue the work he started under Haszek.
"In two years we've managed a great deal of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"Processes have been initiated which may only come into force in a few years, and I would only see that someone stopped," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Haszek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"He's got people behind him who would make the football so he'd only be there for the chosen."
I guess you can throw something away, but you don't think I'm partisan."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not just the chosen," said Rijkl.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a Czech president.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a matrice part, whose winners then ascend to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that only three marble clubs in the league today, which is a problem especially for young players in March," says Rijkl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paklík has joined the fight for the President's function, Rijkl is not willing to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its Vice-President and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," said Rijkl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lotteries Act as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly due to the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says from Pelta, "he was previously disqualified from helping Czech football to new confidence," he holds the second rival - Pacík for a strong candidate who has really offered the football something.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Haszek has started and would obviously not change the staffing in the Commission."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things around for his own good," says Rijkl about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Beach basins in Ufo-optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Anyone who travels through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a walk the tired legs rest in spa baths.
A book shows where Wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past half a year, one in her bag was not allowed to miss: her bathing suit.
Backdrops lying on the water, she looked high in artificially designed dolls, she swam against marble sticks waiting for them on the edge of the basin, and stood over the acribically restored youth-style swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly took it into her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored by architect Meder in this way - and she now presents them in her recently published book "Bade Freuden": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete building" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she took her "Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing enthusiast.
With sport she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water is the other.
It's only unfortunate that swimmers have to get rid of blue tiles and chlorgestank, while Jogger can listen to the disturbing scent of fictitious forests or to a happy bird's eyebrows in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect nice baths."
Water surface double architecture
Placers in the spring basin and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have done their best, the swimmers can be a real eyebrow: "Sitting on a floor has a water surface in the baths."
"She is transparent on the one hand, but she reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optically: high waves, colored tiles, springboards.
The small-information video band "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of knowledge about the history of architecture and culture of the historical wellness oasis - but especially makes you want to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrated water in an urtician karst cave (housing bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in view from the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the drive on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits bathing guests in Langenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three to the top, it evaporates in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals are said to be in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector bear the smell of chlorine into her nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Arpád bath in the Hungarian Béquescsaba, it smells so strongly like heating oil that one can hardly believe to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate healing water, which is almost black and its smudge clings to one on the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschwitz, she found a locked ground.
The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, was now closed.
As a bear glanced through the red-white-yellow window of the young-style building, she saw how unkempt broke between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decline has been countered in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases already have this bathroom behind them; you can not only discover neo-Roman elements that come from the times of its creation in 1844, but also a maurice hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of the pool Kenner Iris Meder - and not just because it originally originated from the Black Forest.
"It is already a performance to merge so many different building blocks into such a great unity," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a side matter.
Agrar-Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets the raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-Online information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw on the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, it is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable to speculate about banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to a study.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it is exacerbating the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann that the taxes on the global stock exchanges drive prices up - and the banks are therefore guilty of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically at Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the sugars have been disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business would be "valued to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank into play".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the drafts from the Foodwatch report.
The examination should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of the German Bank - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank will then inform the bank of its consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete reversal.
Ackermann is basting on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing food prices of the food industry are particularly dramatic, as no account is taken of banks today's damage to the general good."
Ackermann is now the chief bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money is used for betting at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the call of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes at first glance surprisingly, but it is clear that the Group Manager wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive will not change to the Board of Supervisors otherwise than planned.
With a reversal of the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible exploits he hardly needs to shave - so he would finally have to do his successor.
Each second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Thus, just 11 percent consider it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers facilities where food prices are set.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second, according to the survey, would cancel all the installations in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43% would be known to have been denied by such a bank, 49% would have said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 was awarded prizes, became a museum in Vienna, standing empty and standing.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous cows and new building materials typical of the faith in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made it known to the architects that he also built the next world exhibition in Austria's Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus the sky-like construction in Munich, he was finally famous internationally in 1973.
His Pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition was set up, rebuilt and opened in 1962 at the Swiss Südbahnhof after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden, a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called.
But the building was not spatial and technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the contemporary art was given a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he now calls the "21st House" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a fortune in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a remarkable career, among others in the youth as an ice-cream runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, emphasized the reconstruction of politicians and memorialists, acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same foundation, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built.
Strong supervision, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had significantly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he had studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna and the pavilion was a "very important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the Ur-Design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost when he moved to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
In the construction of the building, there were far greater problems: the building was "an energy switch", says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulated glass and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled tyres have been repaired.
Two submarines brought room for the new use, a lowered light hole between the house and the street ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is removed in the old red-brown rust protection paint.
And even the cinema is exactly what it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Memorial Office and with a small state.
"Frequently a material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also loved the memorial service," says Krischanitz and points to a rumbling ground in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "that came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a proper consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there is a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden there is just the completely planned "main station district", with office and residential houses.
And another accident may still happen: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Train plans winter crisis package in million height
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn issued a newspaper report which said that this year more than EUR 70 million was added.
The "Picture" clock previously reported on a group crisis plan, until 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were foreseen.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow support to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free rail tracks from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 per cent of the necessary flexibility.
Two months ago, train chief Rüdiger Grube had also warned in this winter after a summit with government and industry before train accidents and delays.
In the last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in the main station of Cologne had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new win from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry crisis is still taking on its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in comparison with the five major partner banks in the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks to have led the partner banks with false commitments to buy financial products; they would have taken the risks.
Such securities have lost their value during the financial crisis and the banks have gone deeper.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without having to bring the parties to trial," said a German bank spokesperson in New York.
The Bank did not agree with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the arrival of the two financial houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. corporate banks and intervenes to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA seeks to replace the damage caused by billions of serious damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of its kind.
The regulator had also hired other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage papers are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These house loans are based on.
When the U.S. real estate blase placed in 2007, this became a host of financial corporations into debt.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank killed Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been taking place for several years, the banks are currently fighting a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless complaints to obtain reparations or to commit errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint.
It proposes 18 international large banks to transfer two US state-owned real estate finannie Mae and Freddie Mac to mortgage businesses in the amount of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, here several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Authority requires that Frankfurters are directly responsible for "substantial losses", but not to mention an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as incessantly and explained that it wanted to refuse.
Warren Buffet rises with 10 billion at IBM
Financier Buffat invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
To date, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always said not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of companies is only forecasting bad.
However, he has now read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM provides services in particular and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight blow in the financial world.
Consequently, the IT Urgestein IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed in the US economy sender CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is thus one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM had not even known about the engagement.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had provided for good profit.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
For a long time IBM has been focusing on lucid IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
The over 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffet had been more involved in technology companies than ever before.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffet approached, for example, a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine farmer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 own subsidiaries in a range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had acquired the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with smart investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost disappointing sense of money gain has brought him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
Following the announcement of the Buffet investment, the IBM share increased by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion in the stock exchange and thus, along with Apple and Microsoft, is among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", Turkish media in the German rule of law doubted.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now alive.
The murder of eight Turkish-speaking and Greek small-scale entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German Turks, therefore, a long-standing mistrust is returning: since the firefights in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turkey.
Even so, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany has never been a question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent that is not yet visible for a long time.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The paper Sabah, on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and shows that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical suffrage.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish municipality of Germany: she reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a mahnwache in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkish procurement agreement.
In happy colors the scene was staged - as a history of success.
As an earpiece, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fifth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken for granted to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German internet forums, it is extremely critical to discuss the conduct of the police and their subsequent pursuit.
Why have not the German authorities been more likely to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
At least one is willing to resort rhetorically to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be slammed here, there is nothing left to the migrants except self-defense and arms".
"That'll probably be the best self-protection."
"For the good of understanding and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network, it depends very heavily on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means, if the internal peace in Germany is at risk, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s revealed.
The photo of the Solingen brandy is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that suspicions and distance can go right into violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of the weather on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the defeat of German politics after the attacks was mainly called for: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the firefight of Solingen, he sent a prayer telegram to the Turkish state presidents, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the mourning party in Cologne - Kinkel then told us in his speech how many taxes the Turkish people paid.
Just as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax duties.
The current report by the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the suspicion of many Germans has been in the current rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and reassessment of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, there is a need for open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located, not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, the UBS almost went bankrupt and has since become a crisis to the next.
Now it's up to a German.
That's not how Axel Weber must have thought.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal Bank in July, it was announced that in 2013 he was going to enter a nearly as spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucid career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS has created the Tournament."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would come differently.
A UBS dealer in London had turned all the bank's security systems around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in the famous banker Switzerland, had to go.
The President-in-Office of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since also been struck - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber could advise the bank from February 2012.
And he is taking over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it'll be hard.
He is not a banker, but an economic professor and notary and would certainly have needed a time of engagement.
With a stroke he then assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has just proved that he has been entitled "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
Because the UBS, on the one hand, is huge - until recently she was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has been ravaged by a scandal in the next years.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is saved.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the shady and solid but also exploded Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS 2007 managed $1.6 billion more than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was promoted as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That impressed me.
The only banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, said, "I always set up the UBS as the model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I just be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it became apparent that something was going wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli came back abruptly, which until then was considered to be a high-tech and also a great banker.
A few months later, you knew why he was gone.
The Bank's investment party had been embroiled with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To shoulder this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
She actually found investors, however, who, over which some of them had just passed the nose: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so silent that one did not even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to announce new billions of losses, the Executive Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid Governing Board of Switzerland, declined.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was faced with its failure to invest in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss ownership company gave six billion francs for a forced conversion loan that it was able to become the bank's co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see Chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," Bankenresearcher Geiger says.
On the first disaster, the second one joined.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and explained its willingness to release the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn with the help of the bank's taxes.
In addition, it agreed to a $780 million payment - as a repayment of unfair profits from these transactions and a fine.
The UBS was known more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had been her capital since in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of insanity.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank lost its credibility in both central areas of business: in the investment banking through misfit speculation and in the asset management through tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS is going to get it back, then this invincible merchant story follows: a single dealer begs 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: risk management in investment banking is obviously not yet working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has to be noted that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial head of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had come long ago to become guardians of the world's great wealth: not too great a risk for security for money - it was also the hope that the world would break up beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unsurpassed reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank – it is just a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Railway, which leads directly from the Main Station to Zurich Lake, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS enters through a heavy turning door.
In addition to the bank logo, the walls are marble-coated, with thick leather armchairs, a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both large banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, but sometimes pushed - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two Grand Banks.
The UBS has become too big, he finds – especially in the investment banking, where the angels had also expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say there anymore.
"And if so, they've adapted themselves to the seats of the angels."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, it only secured high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million nation decided to take the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hassig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were committed by politicians to save the large bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could it happen?
When you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for the small Switzerland - and was growing.
It helped to add the two different preliminary banks of the UBS: a rich, but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised.
All of a sudden, the internationalised investment banks came at a cost of a lot of money, so that they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Group Chief of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banker researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-tech, humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked all the way from the bank's teaching to the top."
But Ospel has finally left on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Of course: Overconfidence came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the leadership meetings at which Group Chief Wuffli issued the same word again and again: Goldman Sachs hit the throne.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She introduced the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks at that time.
Then the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already been taken to make her happy.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played it all the way up.
However, corporate advisors who were commissioned stressed a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a great distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS moved into an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank and a hedge fund invested in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgage loans and continued to do so – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to clean up seemed harder than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become the seat of lockers and are awake to this day.
He who now leads the Grand Bank has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has come up with all the closely related business models.
Bank researchers Geiger already has an idea: close with the investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But the investment banking is going to shrink hard, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was actually only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly separated itself from predecessors.
In the meantime, he has continued: he is going to conduct the UBS business permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the stand in the mid-19th year.
It's 3500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
In public, he only says so far, he and his wife will only look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has given the US investors the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained powerless.
The shaken industrial production on the continent casts hope for a stabilization of the debt crisis in Keim.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still in full swing last week, not as half empty - but now the problems were repressed in the foreground, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were included in the sales list.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values noted at the end of the trade with a negative of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer hung between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt the Dax agreed with a 1.2 per cent reduction of 5985.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and has reached the end of the recovery.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as Eurostat reported.
That's what US investors were skeptical about: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffet confirmed this caution only: It is not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early in his view to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett cast a decade-old principle over the hips and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and allowed it to be listed against the trend in the course of trade for the first time almost a percentage higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffet has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to its own data and is now 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's equity certificates amounted to 2.6 percent more than the market.
The house is essentially silvering the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and spending $6.6 billion on it.
The Institute wants to boost its capital ratio with net profit from the business and thus meet stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing added and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and reported the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares were transferred to the owner.
719 added values, 2281 added after and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 630 million shares in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 in the sales.
Smart cranes expand in cities
In many places seedlings are considered to be "problem birds": however, the high-tech animals are no longer allowed to spread out of the cities for long, alleged experts.
One they like, the other they want to get rid of very quickly: crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many municipalities there are people who complain about the shit and noise of animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" has not yet been seen.
Seeds were no longer to be extracted from the cities, experts said during the first crop symposia in the eastern Frisian forest.
There, experts from all over the federal area offered opportunities.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists have also led the problems in cities to the land escape of the specially protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Cows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 pairs of bridesmaids exist, among them in the western soybean, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in wood.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of rabbits in the countryside provided negative striking lines.
Critics described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the defeat of knots as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the digestion, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out from empty.
Nesters spray with water or fall trees, have often undesirable effects, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg also said.
"The animals leave, large colonies break up and spread to other places."
Degradation should be considered only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we will not leave them."
Without the environment, the problem could not be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It is possible to consider a combination of the animals' nests from sensitive habitats and shelters to re-occupy them elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different approach to the animals: "We can finally bear one pixel in the face with the best of our self-awareness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfäd, where he was informed of the life of high-tech seedlings.
The project is already being adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There is every amount of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds use not only aids to reach a bee, but they even produce their own tool as a means of aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the extent to which the bird's intelligence is sufficient.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to make a hole to get to a motten larvae.
Without much training they realized the target, which size and shape a stone must have to be made to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the pphyphic crows then had to solve a more cumbersome problem.
In an upright cylinder, the researchers had placed a small eel with a mottenlarve.
With the garbage, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wires on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with which they then huddled the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seeds even succeeded in this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup continued.
The favorites are Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland at the EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Guided by the double-successed Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53) beat Portugal Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after 0:0 from the example.
In the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro, the Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0), after the example (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
No longer burned Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82th) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved further hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvėzdan Misimovic with a transformed commercial dimension (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the 2010 WM Playoffs in South Africa.
In the stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started to measure.
Ronaldo hunted a frenzy of about 30 meters for early driving into the masks.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his wide ranges and reached a distance of 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjager Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger of the English Table Leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball does not exceed the torline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Then, Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Strafrum, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade mark after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which probably transformed Misimovic.
After the break, however, the European Vice-President made it clear with four hits in 2004.
For the Czech Republic, in the 81st minute, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt.
In this way, the European Master will be driving to EM for the fifth time in 1976.
The team of Coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (FC Nürnberg) had also been lucky and had to pass a second in the beginning.
Schlussmann Petr Cech prevented a potential owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunity when Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from turning from the penal border just barely at the door of Chech.
After the break, the queerlate had to save for the world-class tower of the Czechs, again the FC Seoul stormer had withdrawn (50.).
The door just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey then missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come out more than 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must thus make sure that his seat on the WM-third bank of 2002 is as good as possible, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice over their fourth participation in an EM-end.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost started a dream.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Ian met only the Pfos, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even lower the treadmill in the door.
But after the second of fear, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmund Ivan Perisic from the 62th minute, the Bundesliga legionaire Danijel Prnjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Entracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapatoni leads to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of the 4-0 success in the example of a preliminary decision, in which 32 minutes led.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) smooth for the guests.
Ireland pressed for time from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible leadership.
But in the 32nd minute, it was so far.
After an insulted defense by Schlussmann Pavel Londonak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to the line of 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to be flown, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up employees accordingly," Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
From now on, the team will grow to about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will be doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Some 4,000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide are in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its revenues to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had saved around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, is as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitive and generous Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fears. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates", begins with a long list of main people who go to heart.
Here is a hint how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in England's romantic story, and these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like England's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and your illusions are stolen.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe as "a work of anti-history" inapplicable.
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, fast reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and Fear" almost brings together the war experiences of 20 more or less impenetrable men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, car drivers and office staff.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives fades like the vowels in a church, some come to destroy others.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the vengeful war on the Westfront.
"Beautifulness and Fear" travels with expert views over other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall to bee bodies, a celebrated Christmas night among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets fly are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war overflows the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells like Cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or grab the escape?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Failible facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and rumors."
"Beautifulness and Fear" is followed by individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were taken mainly from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in the context of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and self-help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radiation rubber, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacements in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in Hammelfat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes that were saturated with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "It feels that in spite of all this, what was more meant for men to sit in the chair than to sit in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and to do so as meant such a facade civilization and as there was no barbaric behind their own strengthened and battered shirt chest."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that he will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you think of self-sacrifice, you want to think that this is happening in front of a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit that strikes while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseeable way and there are just as liberal behavior as heroism.
England speaks to the soldiers who actively tried to contact a prostitute with a gender disorder to escape the frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonocock-Eiter, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate drew him into the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry is flattered and yet urgent and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he began the way the war "uncontrollable forces uncontrollable in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are bringing them into battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive historical books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most glorious end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's like with his book he took this page away from us with the main people in front of the nose and lit us with a stringwood.
After an early misstep, a minutely planned overrun
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing helmets.
They had decided to spend the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officers were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in one exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was challenging.
Last week's events, such as the use of pepperspray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the desert and gives the houseowners a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officers reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who was familiar with the commands said what a statement called "execution".
"The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officers of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to park the park, but then weeks back when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation from Tuesday, including police officers from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are normally employed in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that during the day many people in the park enter and leave, almost like a pendler, so that 1 hour at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the smallest number of people in the park stayed," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready to leave at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages that came out of the speakers seemed to embarrass many Protestants.
When public officials entered their bright blue windshields in the park, many protestors simply gathered their things together and left the place.
The police said that up to 1:45 p.m., no tents would be taken to give the Protestants time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials have been seen as they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the President of the police, said this was done to their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to keep them from watching the police in the park, and they said the officers' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the large interrelationship of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial lawns and toys with clothes, they followed their city cleaning staff who lifted what had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of Protestants referred to near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some repaired barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp are tied to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officers have been called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, up to 3:30 p.m., no arrests were carried out in the park.
The room was closed after the police said it was 75 minutes away.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, due to "indiscriminate resistance and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Affairs, was also there.
Despite his presence "guided" Mr. Kelly "not the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street, were waiting.
In Cortland Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block farther south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these places from the police continued to extend around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officers, many of them with shields, were observed driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern region.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At five o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tire of a police bus.
In one place the amount threw a piece of wood.
In the end, an official and a Protestant came to the hospital.
The Board of Trustees will file a complaint against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to report to the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that poor students teach are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is likely to be the last possibility that the trade union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals.
Twenty-six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other staff members who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs in a chess course on October 7th, described the union leader as a political rachet for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups to close the budget gap last year.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that dismissals were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing more specific in the budget than the release of school support staff.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and eight workers fired as plaintiffs, who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city is not in a position to comment on their individual allegations.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals at the schools in the city's poor districts to support a complaint for inequality. It claims that poor schools had lost more help as they were chronically underfunded.
It shows that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 assistants were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at the 36th public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students were in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not the neighbourhood of well-known parents who can organize donations to receive budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th District was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each Armenian school register.
The union also complained that the leaders of the High Schools were led by language into a memo that approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess", to describe the action, even though "excess" (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Six hundred and sixty care coordinators were released, not transferred," says the complainant's draft.
Mission completes, Congress is ready to understand about Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington would already have agreed on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolution, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides a resolution that supports President John Kerry (Massachousts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), while commending Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support for its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libya debate.
This summer, both parties' legislators and the White House dispute the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disprove the role of the US military in the NATO Libya Mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad border group of the two parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Moreover, the House endorsed a decision to reduce the funds for US operations in Libya.
This led the US mission to a kind of legislative fegefire - with a congress that was forced enough to criticize Obama's actions within the mission, but not angry enough to finally remove the ground from his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "might congratulate the Libyan people on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-exemption" and " promises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Agency for Foreign Relations or will they be divided between the legislators, as the June law has done?
The last version is against the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Committee's top republican.
Lugars spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every parliamentary period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area to be put to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
GoodLatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - other differences are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change and another dozen in the Senate alone that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially the beginners of Republicans who want to polish up their lives - the possibility of having written such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be presented by members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation on two presidential term.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change which prohibits a marriage under gender equality is just as a change that prevents the burning of flags is an ever-increasing template.
Some legislators would also like to be allowed to repeal federal laws if two-thirds of the States refuse to do so.
As intensely as the members propose, they move as fast as they did in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, 77 such amendments were tabled by legislators. at the 110th Congress 66.
Compared to the early 1990s, in which the members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures provided by the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Founded, but not defeated", said Giffords in his first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man had shot her from a nearby distance during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Giffford (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran for words and needed help in going.
The show showed the severe slow recovery of the damage caused by the ball that divided its skull, which pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the Congress to give her voice to the debt brakes in triumph.
In her first television interview after the January attack, when six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford laughed, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special is tracking Gifford's recovery since the attack on January 8.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long shell over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with a head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then their first words, "What?"
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's healing: You can see the congressional delegates singing together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily on therapy, said she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he had read Gifford's article on March 12th about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged gunman Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll be back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At one point, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines gathered around him.
The quantity in black tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A rank military officer on the Gala, who was observed among others by the Chief of Staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as infants," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The striking contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most remote, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, servants say.
The public is increasingly acting as if you are making people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to support us is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also learned that the anger that returned troops fought against the Vietnam War in recent years was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "grievous, violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over a state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators were subtly asking whether he was able to stand right after his return from the struggle to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against them," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performance in the battlefield is seen by a country that has little experience with the military and sees only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely taken out as a praise.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was normal in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public mostly concentrates on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military poses the growing pressure to resort hard to rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are charged with non-violence in cases of rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of plaintiffs will be ready for the next hearing.
Topless Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant on the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who brought a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texanerin removed their concerns.
I thought, "But what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came after her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are anxiously awaiting a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they will decide whether a complaint they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will be brought before court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not resort to widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint, involving 17 plaintiffs who, however, increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they had been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to identify, condemn or provide appropriate legal proceedings after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture's vengeance? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 other survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Your Strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many further complaints to keep the pressure up.
The Defence Team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice before the Newsweek provide details of the defence strategy, first of all, that the military cannot be accused by current or former soldiers of violations to which it has come in the military.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for any injuries to soldiers in the active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is in the name only: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time the military is being modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle; three other complaints are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academys for the alleged promotion of a female-enemy atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is bringing up a complaint against the military, in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" received by the victims of rape in order to release them from service - a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans), in which they imposed discriminatory practices in their dealings with performance claims for persons who indicated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (e.g., the Office for the Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes every year.
The report, published in March, also examines the criminal prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases were brought before the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the rape.
Six persons said that they were characterized in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the waves would use it, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure.
Lyman was asked to search for a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it ineffective.
In January 2010, she was dismissed in an dishonest manner so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the complaint submitted by Lyman and the other plaintiffs comes forward is purely speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "I think they should come forward."
What lies between them and a judgmental case is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I've been a critic of the Feres doctrine for a while.
The military points out a decade later, because they do not have the same motivation and the same fear that brings a liability with them.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its course, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will begin with hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reform comes," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How to observe researchers on Facebook
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who stood at an ammo in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in on Facebook.
"We found it not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report by the British Ideanfabrik DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hidden personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups across Europe and then visited them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, Add's users invite a survey in which they were asked about their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 members of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office even once.
"It is a rather new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online advocates of right extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this site in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people who usually do not reach with their clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook it's all gone - they're going straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their Facebook performance tend significantly more to drink problems than students who were talking about it.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as resident advisors, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify dangerous children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly collects data from its own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in the 2010 elections and a national happiness index (which used first of all data that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large database available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they want it now or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to produce your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two very different things," says Selwyn.
So despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social environment - and every amount of social life is still going offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amoks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the Court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hasideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't recognize myself guilty."
Judge Torkäl Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, since he did not want to allow Breivik to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, the permission to turn to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police keep it under investigation for 12 more weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will be closely monitored for all visits and correspondence over eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and riegel.
Everyone took part in the goal of getting everything out of place.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it's going to be a bit further after I've seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre remark that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had complications.
It may seem to some that the attacks of 22 July appeared to be the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does it automatically ease the anxiety and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lectures of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After Steve's death, on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford and highlighted the technique as a great modern inventor.
What Apple Fans find, however, perhaps in the most recent rediscovered job interview, which was launched this week before special film shows on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even named hippie, but he was also an acrobic organizer who was jealous of diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of the mind", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachidiotes" about the break-up of the computer, and he spent more than an hour with jobs where they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidioten, he says that copies of the interview were missing in the delivery.
Only after Job's death did a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to dislike detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four long breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes to pass when it appears impatiently reacts to Cringley's questions and attracts him to take action more quickly on issues or side-effects of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview appears somehow incredibly wide when jobs evaluate what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represent their own vision for the future of the computer.
It's a thing to read posthumous awards of career jobs'. But here to see jobs as the desirable dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he walked away and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I've found that.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline the accounting with Apple.
Surprised at how costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were only suspected and then adapted to "deviation", he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was blinded:
Jobs are told by the Blue Box, which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could get involved in the telephone company and have fun talking.
Much about the device has already been written, but Job's excitement when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is striking.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you cried on the phone, it came out a minute later next to the phone," says Jobes kicking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be any Apple without it.
Jobs continue to tell by a glorious line, the Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were so well able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Church were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomats, both had to laugh before the pope came to the phone himself.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared call Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, she got a part-time job at Hewlett Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen when I was old and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, one of the HP employees visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown pipes and I fell in love with him.
At HP, I would climb up as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
In the interview, jobs talk about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build up the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the construction and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... she called me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he was able to revive Apple, jobs saw the ways on which so many industrial giants lived with their visions in chairs and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copyer or printer, after and?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are such people] that ultimately run the companies and the product that push people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopolization is eradicated by people who do not have a concept of good products vs. bad products - craft art needed.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've won the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fineties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all come together...
Finally, it runs out on the taste, it runs out on the fact that you try to put each other apart with the best testimony that man has created and then try to bring these things together for what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists shout.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been for the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health laws when the court adopts a case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers the doors behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether an objection to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the chancellor that the case would be represented before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint raised by 26 states against the widespread reform of health, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will be claimed to be in charge of breaking the law will probably be Paul Clement, once a state attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had advised the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican Group in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are released from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events laws close to and from other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, respector or according to the program no guest of such an event."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the relevant offices as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this are sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing breach of morals and the contrary to the Code penalizes the complaints of some judges, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and served during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would be too easily confused with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama government when the first legal proceedings were brought before the court.
Her critics forced Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case because of pre-enforcement, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unenforced.
Kagan doesn't make arrangements to do this.
Boeing attracts record order of 18 billion dollars on land
Air carrier Emirates orders 50 double aircraft of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a store worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It's really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal when the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record amount of 18 billion dollars.
Similarly, Boeing’s customer is unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its highest order at the weekend of all times for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer order came from the air carrier Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option for the purchase of 20 other aircraft, which increases the total list price to 26 billion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner, which greatly improves the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stockbroker of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many of the airlines in the Middle East are in the ownership of the oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, it's an increase in oil prices that usually harms airlines, since this is one of their biggest cost points, not so bad, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when the oil prices are rising, Dihora said.
"They have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing’s leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the power position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced, one would move the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was moved to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and scope.
Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seems to be losing her election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer against Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's posts.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for government posts in the western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the Tuesday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied polls, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just barely beaten Claderon who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Party of Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still the current Governor, came to place Three, a heavy defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia's capital, lies in connection with drug dealers and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was ruled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still taking place.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were afraid of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reprehensible the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is likely to represent PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us courage next year."
ADB forces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations of the world must do "everything in your power" in order to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that they were looking at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all means."
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has been facing a serious debt crisis.
In the past few days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers have retreated from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe was worried that the global economy could collapse into recession and lead to calls that the leading emerging countries would have to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag said that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU's rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we need to get a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell help to 1.2 billion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of which live on $2 or even less per day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks go to retirement with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with poorly managed jobs, and the loss of facilities such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area would have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB forecast with economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the year 2011/ now threatens "the risk of degradation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable wave markets should create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Emergency warnings from the Pentagon before possible defence cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta called for the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would undermine national security without notice, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the pentagonal halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flows.
The Pentagon is already considering reductions in the amount of 450 billion dollars over the next decade, but is now afraid that further reductions of 600 billion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot reach a conclusion in the issue.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement leading to a so-called decision would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unobservable manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impeccable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also have been forced to dissociate ourselves from most of our civilian personnel inadvertently and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with security of frontier probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our military and seriously damage our alarm."
The cuts were finally met with the fighting forces," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the base budget would have an adverse impact on the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the adjustment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which would result in late payments to war dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators replied to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of an invasion by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are strongly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing that should push us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senator's new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to remove the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly made the possible cuts, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before reaching the tip of the Pentagon and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with shells, but without kernels.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air weapon failure without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paperman, an army of cashiers, buildings and bombs without trained soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening statement in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of dispute that lacks moral and alarm and that is unable to deal with potential opponents."
"She's making a real one get angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details of how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global employability and accessibility, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and marine need to replace the humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to 80 billion dollars over the next 10 years, but the proponents say that it is an important next step in the process so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
How to Banish a Lie
A look at the current beating lines shows how dangerous and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the Lord of the charges of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides are facing each other's lies.
The management of Penn State is accused of the opinion, as reportedly reports have been withheld, after which a retired football coach boy has been sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy accused US President Barack Obama of being a liar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroy careers and startling countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he brought about denials that were very quickly rejected by insurmountable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of the campaign funding, which is linked to the mutilation of an external affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship.
Stories about foaming in the school and college exams are widely distributed.
There were occasions in which teachers provided their students with the test answers so that they could be there themselves during their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and scams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are considered necessary.
Another study shows that foreigners lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "discover lies" is one that is important to everyone, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "Have You!", the detachment of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at respected universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of research is that most of the old myths about lying have been disbanded.
Lies look one in the eye.
They don't always stomp, stomp, red and zapple.
From this, however, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and disprove.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questions and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of evaporation, and it is clear that evaporation is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding justice in our complex world, especially when the recruitment or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people whose interest in awakening and controlling their own emotions. And they feel intuitive how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, the extroverted people often lie more often than introverted people that men often "self-centered" lies than women whose lies "orientate themselves more" - usually to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was expelled as an evildoer, others felt less guilty of having angels.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing this person's normal behavior.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point to the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the quality of the voice of your testant.
You should know better when someone usually trips with the foot, so they don't blame him for injustice when he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then be careful to follow the upswings of verbal and nonverbal behaviour.
Do not view these attachments as alarm bells, which scream, as evidence of detachment.
People who are deceived may hesitate when they try to remember their history. Perhaps they point their feet towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relieve after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing breath and change of attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questions often falsely signal that an attitude conversation is over, just to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the attitude conversation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your trial person.
Scott Peterson's ex-wife is famous when he used the form of the past, when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Disgusting people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a vicious question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a stupid question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
By doing so, the answer will be more tangible than a matter, which often triggers alarm bells.
There is no magic tool to banish lies, but you can learn skills by which to banish them.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised by delayed US authorisation after risk
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, in which the trade unions were upset and at the same time calmed down environmental protection, it is the pipeline-building company that is trying to redesign the project in order to return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills will be redirected to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will finally be approved, even with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be submitted until the new possible course was reviewed to avoid the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may take place by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and said it would support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline had to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who oppose the plan, weigh down the laws to force a withdrawal from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the environmental impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had only a small impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the head auditor of the Ministry had requested a separate probe of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice, since it is in contact with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly being a child out of fear of being beaten
A New Yorker family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have received a search attack that would have frightened her little daughter so much that she gave up in fear.
The tyranny of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Rosana Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Rosana Monk said she stopped near the door and laid down her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to her arm," she said.
LaBelle reminded the pregnant woman of her anger.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I said, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to chime - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to spit water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother, who still carried Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her escort and dragged to a waiting car," said Rosana Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelles' lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is based on a non-specific compensation, but the family attorney Sam Davis said that he did not take a fee and that the family was planning the money they would get, would contribute to child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put in front of a baby gardener who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate resistance inhibited the economy
In the first year, where Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments decreased and the economy stagnant.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of the change and who has lost great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, because of the climate resistance, it cannot be the speech of growth, but rather the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only resulted in losses of millions in agriculture, but also set close limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decrease in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which has a brake on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report by the Council of Mexicano para el Development Rural Sustainable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous rise in unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estadostica y Geography observed a rapid increase in unemployment, as from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 per cent of the population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Less liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments on the policy of public institutions declaring the growing unemployment indirectly.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in funds adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due to the problems of entry and to the difficulty of finding work there too. These people stay here and seek work here, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when considering the high proportion of black labour, which includes 60.38% of the domestic workers who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labour are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Agency) and the Secretariat of Labour y Prediction Social (Governmental Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos, which is much less than the total national average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to the downturn in economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years has been recorded. According to the Secretariat of Economics (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $630,597 from January to June, representing a shift of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Secretariat for Economic Development (Government for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, in July at the National Congress, the Government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November there was no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, the first year of government, Mario López Valdé's inability to govern was evident.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico) said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very good this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our effort. The efforts of all and, in particular, the progress of the already well-agreed government teams have not been sufficiently matched," he said.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year aggravated and slowed the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will complete the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine the call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confedéración Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Association of Enterprises) in Sinaloa, stated that the state had to be set up for more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will drive the government's efforts on better roads.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg Marijuana
At the age of five, a population of Navalato was sentenced to 100 days in prison because of the possession of eight Kilo Marijuana.
The Republic’s State Prosecutor announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of Marijuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel in monitoring the Cipriano Valdez street against watch post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navalato.
The drug dealer drove in a white delivery car in which he kept a small backpack in a box in the car and in the driver's seat, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the accused goods were handed over to the District Judge and the punishment is still in the prison facility.
Debts for construction
The social buildings provided for in the programs Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the City Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it deserves that exceed 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell on the state. Up to now only the Federation and the municipality had managed the construction work resources, so it was expected to be delayed.
"12 million have to manage them, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a share in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already gone far, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its term of office the municipality had to borrow a loan of 7 million.
"This has already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have enough economic resources. The programmes continue and this year we had to make the funds that the state had not made to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million they have to administer, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court approves for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The High Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) referred to the Constitutional Appeals brought by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Order and the power to bring back the switch of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Legislative Decree with details on the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
By this decision, the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate was rejected, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft for the complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree against the Constitution because the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) was responsible for the radio and television regulations, so the Legislative Decree would be contrary to the Hierarchic principles and the provisions of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero did not apply the Legislative Decree and introduced all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Representatives, without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, namely that the national government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because this leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it improves the use of the radio-electric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the conversion meant that it was a postponement of the use of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest that not only had technical views, "because it included economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required action by the whole system, according to the principle of economic governance by the State, they contained a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in Congress's jurisdiction by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be complied with," she said.
The possibility of counting the voting list in Michoacán individually is taken into account
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes not yet counted from a total of 6074.
This year's election in Michoacán is a reality because according to the data published by the Program de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, while 879 votes of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council General of the Institute of Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that, just on 9 November last year, the polling station had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the Federal States in Wahlange cases.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his election law, or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not come into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has avoided his publication in the public display within the prescribed time-limits with the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the High Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional appeal filed by the local legislature and considered the vote of the Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as "inappropriate and illegal", since he had no right to "conclusion or vote against it".
In an interview on the possibility of counting votes, María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the General Council of the IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the voting list in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be counted in part. The results of the protocols are not in agreement; the vote counting and calculation protocol is not in force or is not owned by the chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, the total number of complete ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-place winner, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting an express request is made by the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of those candidates.
The vote count may also take place in its entirety if it is established, after completion of the proper calculation, that the difference between the prospective winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an express request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages which have been subjected to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to the Prep, the difference between the first and the second places is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rose to Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday. On Monday, the death show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the Colonel's last will was to spread his ashes across the Zapalinamé mountain.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés returned, along with the others who were killed in the accident, on an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, to the capital of Coahuila. The Colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the mayor's ash landed at the hall at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends arrived.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. This body show was attended by his former students from the Technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ash would spread across the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said so to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he was in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to join the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't catch it because they thought it would be too fast for him on a truck. Still, he always tried to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome the entire family, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he was driving to Zapopán to graduate from his family. So he knows that his uncle died when he did what he felt best: flying an airplane.
One last goodbye
The deputy commander of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López with all honors. His honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leaders and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and also in sports as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter flying by him, in which the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, were sitting in the same authority.
At 6.05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met to be handed over to Major Jaime Martinez on the fore-place of the barracks of the property company to members of the Mexican Air Force. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were already waiting for him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a piece of land at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military personnel presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same village in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunmen in different parts of the body and a mercy gun in a abandoned Finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at a point 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago on the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up in locks.
When they looked into the house, they found inside about three meters of bodies of three persons, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another who was clothed with a white top.
Almost a meter away the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on-site, the three persons must have been killed elsewhere, as no cartridge covers were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse are headings that write an organised criminal band to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretary for Defence) introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly active in Cadereyta and who were associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (manhunt) and secret executions.
According to the information made publicly available, eight persons were arrested and a prisoner was released first on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros.
Three property and a phone were secured. The detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November at 6 p.m., military personnel found a car with two badges on its watch in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta.
When the car was inspected, the military found a long weapon, a charger, and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2:00 p.m. on November 13 a.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
Secret additions will be sent to you in the places General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government, which is going to provide the leadership with the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government, which is going to provide the leadership with the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidency Palace announced that Monti would meet with the President of the State on Wednesday to confirm the government's formation.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of technocrats-composed cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to complete these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the government's formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he added.
Monti has managed to create a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. In the meantime, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, needs to adopt a tough savings package, which has been required by Europolitians to regain the confidence they have gained in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was still increased by the fluctuating market situation due to the fact that the Italian state bonds were charged with 7% interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the state of Greece and Ireland forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success chances Montis were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to decline on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the technocrat government that is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the withdrawal of reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is practicing with his notice, a defeat Montis is a disaster, too.
Monti started on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The meeting should be closed at evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, set up an extremely fast government change.
After a short break against the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would retire, uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached critical limits for the Italian state bonds.
A rescue in Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections that are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the process imposed by the pressure on financial markets.
Political sources suggest that mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people in political life.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten out of 50 international games are on the back.
On the side Costa Rica has only one of the 22 summoned 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at 3.05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium, players from both countries are compared.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back at a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-coloured team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only player with over 50 international games.
This number reached him on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury comes with complicated castings at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international meetings within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, which on the last Saturday against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games reached an equivalent level with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Last week, Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side storm Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the sides of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had their debut yet.
The historical castlekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most of the doors, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet referred Costa Rica in his tour to the celebration of its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was insured by the bassist and co-founders of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva a exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will be at the National Stadium at 7.30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an extract from the conversation that is complete in the online edition of La Nazion.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been on vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely out.
What do you guys say to your favorite fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it makes us sad to have taken so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've spent in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we enjoy surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, they are the excellent area for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned from it.
With a look at the tour, she offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't set limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine albums and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we are going to play each is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have no longer played in the repertoire, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, so also for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your 20-year history.
If you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us have imagined playing in a great rock band, and that for more than 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to be actively involved in the birth of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Again and again a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are glad to be still friends with them all and it honours us to be part of this adventurous Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours and the same musicians have stayed together for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) stood with us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands endure.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being alive and also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, so we have opened up musical ways that give each one the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't do better.
Your relationship to glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, you have always been able to do what you want thanks to your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall down this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come for music, you remember that you have to be careful about the music and what it's called into life without being a famous rock star. That's never been of any interest to us.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andrew Woods.
We were disappointed that we had taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who are building the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The local band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band to open up?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this band felt best for us. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is certainly exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's singing the first thing he likes.
Who are you influenced by as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first to come to me are Geezer Butler, John Enwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the earth alive, even though it was no longer a fashion show?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before fall into my mind, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me both when I heard Ed play it. It's very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly incarnate this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25-year-old in prison for violating human rights during his time of government (1990-2000), has several diseases, including gum cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be examining the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members for three days at the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Négliadades Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion could be undermined for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on tooth cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal cavity, kidney stones, blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the National Police Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official adjournment, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the region's political issues
Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. This will be, according to the Uruguayan President, the highlight of his chartered schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the president of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support for the case with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy at the G20 summit in Cannes, South America, put the country on a list of tax havens.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group made up of the most powerful threshold and industrial countries in the world. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At a business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The cutting-edge installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the store halls of the world, was cut off from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which it can be played without a special mirror three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the responsible for the Nintendo press in Spain when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D land" was "the first video game by Nintendo that was developed from the beginning for this console" because so far successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "exquisite" video game that allows for a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D land" included two games: the first part is "light", to capture the less gifted users.
After that, experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles, without the victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three dimensionally.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest editions: The short-lived installer has to overcome platforms that are dangerous to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player hits news on the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Column provides for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would deliver the former Governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States to take responsibility for the 70 million US money laundering.
This is how the process ends on the US's request for Portillo to be delivered so that it can be brought to trial.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered with court decisions and had made all the submissions from which he had been notified.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Columbus procedure is a government act which takes place when all the judicial and constitutional bodies are acquitted of condemning the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when his legal situation is clarified in Guatemala and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for defeating 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his time of government. This negotiation was preceded by delivery, but the minister objected and revitalized the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people who are threatened with social exclusion
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group are being created.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a summary was drawn yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the city district of Trinidad Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the celebrated celebration in Sant Andreu, many officials from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for the past 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives of different directions to election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the president of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green city council Richard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was brought into life in very difficult times and that the times today are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the presidents of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that fights against difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is for the association and the work it does, nothing new," he said.
The occupied house in which giant parties were held has been cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the alpine dreams of the neighbours of House No. 51 on the Balmes street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon in which they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room was held on a fair arrangement without police intervention.
After the room was replaced the door lock to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," the house administrator confirmed.
The houseowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were resident - took all the electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and the tenants were driven to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the start of the household.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the houseowners were making them more unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room was shown by the neighbors for rest, while according to their statement the noise did not stir up by the visitors of the disco, but by the owners of the house, especially the guests of the parties that were organized there, and who, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks, had become more and longer.
The head of the discotheque stated that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the building owner that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) has also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested that the building be removed immediately and that the problems of civil co-operation and the downfall of the city district be addressed last week.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that in the last few months the houseowners had been on all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some, it had even been stolen.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to tackle the social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building was removed from the Catalan police in the city of Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montreal No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were arrested without delay.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, apart from the arguments about the fees.
The city invitation to tender for the 16 towers opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-lost Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) Corporation, this administration published its essay on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park was again in the eyes of many of Barcelona's upper boundary, as the capital of Catalonia is among the few that do not extend in the north-south direction, but to the top (mountain) and the bottom (sea).
The Collesrolas classification as a nature park plays with this idea.
As an example, it was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibar.
As far as the city was concerned, in September a huge tender consisting of 16 competitions was issued for further access to Collserola.
No doubt a door points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's got to put a door on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation is not only from an organisational point of view, but also from the point of view of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recurring topic on which two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can go back.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is valid.
For Roldán, "it is necessary," after an attack on the coast about the "front of the mountain", insofar as the speech by Ildefons Cerda, which is about the green apples, has not been delivered.
"One should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Dore von Collserola" brings in a "lexical case": one cannot imagine it "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to be dealt with."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge", which brings "some dangers" in itself.
Risks resulting from the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swinging song" in the forum area.
The first fear is the own restriction on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to determine the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [concerning the plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is closer to the question, believes simply that the side of Collserola, which is going towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study by the patronate de Collserola that should not "beat on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for having given his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the outset".
In addition, he notes that the closeness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter is which enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubts as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams called into existence ("just the right", he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of the invitation to tender there is a lack of a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This has at least led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a door would coincide with that of the architect of the tower.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strips are so equipped directly across the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length that a smooth transition takes place between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red's officials freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is being conducted against him because of arbitrary repression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released, after he has been pardoned by the chancellor of the Casino Red before the Second District Criminal Court, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for repression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the courthouse.
After the fine, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Pakistani mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministry of Publico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest order, after the official of the Ministry of Publicity had rejected the crimes of theft and organised crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he probably had the owners of the Casino Red with half a million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle-class since he was threatened with murder.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a member of the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given a prison regulation by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that, after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was provided to blame Jonah for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the court in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the commissioners of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be set free in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Publicity, García Gómez, asked whether he had recovered the damage and who the owner of the courtroom had apologized. However, the lawyer kept the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. The following also cannot be objected to, and no damages are required.
After hearing the deputy of the court against 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was released immediately.
The judge, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the legal arrangement for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others died.
The Secretariat of Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) reported that the investigation results of the accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter with its entire unspoilt structure was directly sprayed against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing at 25 meters high had contact with trees, while the helicopter lost its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 insets, which is why he met all the conditions for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no funnel parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine was found.
"In the search, no parts of the aircraft were found elsewhere, the impact covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 insets, which is why it met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a drop of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is preferable to obtain the results of the investigations as soon as possible, but these can take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for aeroplanes and auxiliaries in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the state of Major Presidential flew at a speed of travel and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the attack."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visualization speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of vision flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient views during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM listed suitable weather conditions at the start. During the next flight towards the border between Mexico City and Mexico, some deep-hanging clouds appeared.
Selected flight size:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Place of delivery:
The landing coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent. Perhaps there was no loss of control over the plane before the take-off.
Dispersal of the rest of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information available so far indicates that the helicopter was directly and side-by-side.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was shaken on the ground with its unspoiled structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The rest of the plane offers at the crash site shall not be closed to fire or explosion.
The last survey results indicated several soil contacts.
On-site investigations found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is shooting and shows a drop of between seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area beyond the restricted area of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure had been washed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title "Genetics of Pregnancy in Childhood and Youth", with which the genetic markers should be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Biochemica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports sites of IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday starting at 8.00 a.m. test with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sport site of Cuauhtémoc (in the West of the Federal State of Mexico) and continued since 8 October at the sports site of Nezahualcóylt (in the East of the Federal State of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been achieved, the study will continue at the sport site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and at the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Day of Diabetes, he stated that it is intended that three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 should complete the nutrition-related questionnaires under the supervision of their parents.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, size), blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (testing to identify genes related to obesity in children).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out due to the concerns of health personnel over the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of fat-ridden boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," said IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He said that an (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he stated that the genetics of obesity are forced into the inability to burn out the excess energy (calorie) that we have taken, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were contained in a comprehensive survey of the children, in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin swelling in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicates the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurement and propose changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which means missing movement every day, spending most of the day before television and using means of transport, instead of walking short.
High calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) along with high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents shock holes
Rafael Herrera, Researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road cover were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 impact holes when the rainy season in the Metropolitana del Valle de México area (city of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, cautioning and ensuring that if the discharge and maintenance of the ash cover are appropriate, the number of impact holes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "Technical blowholes", which he held on occasion during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which however has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera thought that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and to avoid striking holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heavy part of the oil - is a hydrogen compound, some of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the street cover its characteristic numerical behavior.
The analytical behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very liquid and it is almost fixed at 50°C while it breaks at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not the same, but one day it changes depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Among the top layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt-bathed and then solidified stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move forward and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of power in the road cover.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is made up of so-called wear layer consisting of small stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
This road cover receives and distributes most of the forces and also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it affects the wear layer behaviour significantly.
When the ground is wet, water enters the layer and only becomes difficult again. This causes a diversion of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of impact holes.
When a blow hole arises," he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained during the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the System Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico’s National Research System) stated that the vehicle load was another important reason for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road cover should always be relative to the vehicle load and it should be ensured that this system is respected to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still pending, for example, on asphalt emulsions that were even on the market in other countries, with which the shock holes could easily and easily be repaired without applying high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss in order to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty when giving the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winning podium, to show a silver crown and the band that she is presenting as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took over the crown and the cedar, the department is already on 14 mischitales and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who almost held the crown in their hands. Among the well-known Masses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1983), Olga María Alzate (1987), Leila Blancé (1988), Monica Ever (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The great question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a great favorite who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not only had she been elected the Queen of the Police and the Mayor of Rostro Jolie by Vogue, a title that also had been given by the beautiful Queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is crucial to the jury's decision to name her as the First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you the most and why?", which she was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca addressed the Frenchman:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much about literature, I think it's a way to civilize myself, finally I think that the book that most strongly characterized for my childhood, 'The Little Prince' is a very deep book.
At the moment, I am reading 'Shuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Treaty'.
An answer, which was in short contrast, first because of the concept of "civilization" and second because it had not specifically explained how each of its books had influenced it.
But after the end of the ceremony Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favorite who had received all the events and received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Oster, public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates were jealous, which made the queen stressed, which was why she could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in the bath suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two lifts at the crowning festival.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlántico representatives showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most of the prizes during the competition will not eventually become queen".
Valle also ended the press out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was involved in the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked with projects before participating in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned with her defects in the third and the fibrosis that she was noticed in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was hardly to be noticed for me honestly, printed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos from Chrome's view, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the performance in the bath suit, a gruesome forecast was created that should be true in the night. It was changed that Raymondo Melina had given a comfort prize so as not to let her come to the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is the fact that Melina has since her reign, not as queen, but as princess, a position that allows her to represent in one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition in Colombia.
However, as one of the queens who had departed the crown in spite of her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will enter the story.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophosposist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophosposist of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophospistes in the ITC department, Elias González had this week a Preparatory Service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the Chocó communities, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completion of the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. the surfaces of the hands and feet.
During the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliezer was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the men who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most investigation, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because it resembled the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp compared to Eleazar the fingerprints of the bodies with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On track search
For a Daktyloscope from Sijin in Cali, the honour given to President Juan Manuel Santos Santos González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscope is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a penalty.
Lophosposists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the detainees.
At their arrest, many offenders either present false evidence or they do not have it.
We'll take their fingerprints off and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to get a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had stood right there with his hand when he pulled out a safe with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, suspects can also be released or loaded.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded by bottled bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it will be linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscope of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a band will be used to pick up.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID," said the CTI expert.
He didn't mean everything was like it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold, what shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is made.
The "Employees" are calling on the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked together in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part came to the room order and changed its location to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, the members of the Occupy Wall Street movement called out the authorities of New York when they tried to re-enter the Manhattan Square with a fair order after they had been cleared from the square in the morning gray and had tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access with a fair arrangement that allowed the "Employees" to re-enter the tent in this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained at the command of the room and occupied a park farther north in the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp at the site, we will meet at another location and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "Employers" to the clearing of their tent camp, which was arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent clearing of the site and authorising the protesters to the tent.
In addition, the "Emperts" occupied a new park, which is located at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police met some of the demonstrators and arrested them, although Bray could not give any exact figures. He assured the news agency Eph that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, in which there had also been an adjournment of religious leaders as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for communication with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a site in private property) remains closed pending a judicial hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday and which will analyse the legality of the room in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the scene carried copies of this legal arrangement and distributed it. They even gave it to some police officers who were watching the scene, which resulted in "some small clashes" as Bray reported, who had shown that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from disposing of members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws passed after occupation and to prohibit demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg informs the press that due to this legal arrangement the reopening of the place for public transport and demonstrators has been suspended. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to reinstate themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zuccotti Square, which was held by almost 200 people in the morning, and which was decided because the demonstrators "opposed the law."
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the arrangement for space because it had " turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to cause harm to others", for "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "their quality of life".
"The room in the morning grey was foolish and shows that Bloomberg is primarily interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were considering organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that protests have been taking place since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the woman of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Canadian TV show.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, together with the "croner" (balladender) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will be able to bring a very special virgin Maria to life.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson – also for the Internet distribution of a porno itself, in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee – as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast by Charlie Sheen as a child.
CTV's Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan Rebirth after Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which has still been recovering after the devastating earthquake that broke into an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to 300,000 dollars, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult economic situation in the world.
After three-quarters of cases, data on the gross domestic product from July to September were intended to conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The resumption can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital installations recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unsustainable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on key-sian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is particularly vigilant thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, due to the increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The sign of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has fled to one of the "refugees currencies" of investors who flee before the eurozone debt crisis and the sad forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a tombstone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen score.
While markets continue to cover the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is growing.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid uptake of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowdown in economic development.
The indicator that predominates the turning points of the world economy made it clear that the biggest economic potential would be the brake.
Because he dropped by four tenths to the los 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100, after it has dropped to 99.13 points by eight decades.
Athens lets doubt rise again
Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-risk risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread insecurity, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new transitional Greek government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
Yesterday, while the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days that he appointed were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new saving measures and would not in any case return his call for new elections to the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement leaves no doubt about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the Transitional Government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organisation that needs the 8000 million Athens urgently, and he made it clear that he would not agree to a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreou referendum, confirmed yesterday that it did not agree with its call: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the Troika " very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government what "was needed for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knoll still has a bit of thread for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position on the role of small-scale financing worldwide".
The Queen of Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the second donor worldwide for this fund for international cooperation. Its "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in humans".
Yesterday, the Queen dedicated to the fifth World Summit on Small Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to reach the thousands of years spent by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal, the number of people living with incomes of less than a dollar per day, that is, below the "poor limit".
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task with responsibility", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit to Thursday are guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The Smallest Credit Summit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be sought that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would be exceeded the poverty line.
The concept of the smallest credit goes back to Spain and the rest of the world on the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago", which the Queen of Sofia regards as "an act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as a "wonderful idealist who has written himself into the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday, declared the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "rapporteur of the poor".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical command"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind development aid to economic booms at times, because it is a "sustainable commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans should be a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of industrial states should now work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the "main forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, called "the success", "marginalized" people, "the always standing in front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "your door, lit up by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote.
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but was carried on in the fall, especially to provide sufficient support to those activists who consider the government policy on Greece today and perhaps Italy to be too late tomorrow.
The Presidency proposal from the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which was first seen by Angela Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, were not open to any doubt by the three European Finance Ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor - as well as the requests - is the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only is it because Europe means peace, but it also means "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a break in Europe".
This could be reflected by a revision of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budgetary policy of the euro area countries, strengthening the control of the European Union; however, this could be done in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely it is only unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Grob-British is against the thing, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the ECB’s Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously meant a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor of the climate in her party has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the difficult European countries that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the importance of "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody slaughter two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the case of disease reports?
After family support, UMP and government now attack the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15th, to look up a family fund and talk about the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been on the way back since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the aim of bringing the economy into a hard test, on the other hand, which does not represent less pre-emption of an axis of the right Presidency campaign, the majority want to concentrate on workers' health notices.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government proposes the introduction of a fourth day of quarantine before taking into account a health report for private workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the consent of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
According to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" there is a threat of swearing anger, but it would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And those who were more symbolically involved with another take: give the state officials an unremunerated day in the case of sickness (so far there is no time for them, in contrast to the three days in the private sector, no time period).
While these issues are being debated, the majority are also emerging from the subject of fraud, which is aimed at the abuse of employment.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and beyond that, they will be refunded if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 before the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports appear to be disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives, which have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more often sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, we are staying at the countrywide figures first.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Fund, more than €237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily surveys in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave as well as occupational accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were allowed on average only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One medium value that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, indicated that 75% of the 40,000 respondents, French workers, reported not taking a single day of illness.
Another study this time from health insurance shows that 37% of the reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Research Centre for Science (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of absence (based on disease or otherwise) was oscillating between 10% and 11% in France compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness reports are an increasingly low proportion of black work.
As far as employment is concerned, only a weak approach is reached here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls in case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training and further training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 realized short-term reports, which were in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of systemicly controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, 1.2 million 11% were counted as "unadjusted or unjustifiable" cases, which amounted to 132 000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have made a report.
A figure that represents only a weak comparison with, for example, those of black work.
According to the UMP Member, Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue published in July, represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profits per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, in addition to the fact that the governments of the Union did not agree for a hundred days to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme for budget adjustment," said the chief of government in his first public speech when he opened the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-Mediterranean summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement in the euro area is at stake, as he added.
According to M. Papademos, the country's state deficit "was 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year after it was 15.7% in 2010 and 2009.
Rights deny the new savings receipts
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved takeovers in respect of an attempt to obtain the proceeds of the debt crisis, but had foreseen that his party would not agree to an additional takeover.
"We will not vote in favour of new elections," he said on occasion at a parliamentary meeting of his party New Democracy.
He had been prepared to declare himself ready with the requirements for reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as for combating wastefulness, however, any policy was hostile to that which would impose economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with the tasks of the EU Commissioner-in-Office for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of over EUR 8 billion to all parties without a written guarantee of their support for the planned takeovers, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from Auves.
Euthanasia and accompanied freedom must be legalised, so an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, as shown in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The Board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relief measures, including cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts involved in various fields of ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
The experts cite a recently published survey of the independent EIU society, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th grade, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut down the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so we are told by the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of these people die in the hospital.
From around the country, the rate of deaths in Quebec is the highest in 86% of cases in the hospital.
In the big question of euthanasia and accompanied Suizid, the authors of the report are opposed to conclusions from the position of the federal government, which has already enacted no changes to the criminal law concerning Euthanasia and accompanied Suizid.
However, there is no evidence, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalised Euthanasia and associated Suizid, that such decriminalization would entail abuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied Suizid by incompetent or inadvertent persons.
On the contrary, there have been substantially more cases of such offences in countries where euthanasia and associated Switzerland have not been legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasis is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanying Suizid is practised in Canada, although this is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Defend Euthanasia
We are aware that according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already committed themselves in favour of Euthanasia, as they believe this allows people at the end of their way of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that Euthanasia is legalized does not have the effect of conveying the message that the life of older or disabled people is less valuable.
With regard to persons who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or adjustment of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, the author of the report.
They also point out in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should specify that the suspension of the funds for which a valid refusal has been submitted should not be considered as criminal.
In addition, the Expert Group calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a reduction in the means at the end of life and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The Board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painkillers in order to provide the best painkillers, including cancer.
Finally, with regard to the resources already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the Board calls for at least consideration of them, since they were as little as euthanasia, to reduce physical pain and apply to the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschemps, a specialist in health law, referred to the position of the signatory experts, among other things as "extreme", since they did not set any limits for euthanasia in patients in the end phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values that are involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, there are "guidelines and commitments in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "Pro-euthanase-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and associated Suizid are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad to power
Chess game against a "complet"
Syria is more isolated in view
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auven ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Baschar al-Assad, however, which is being overcome by Russia's support and a "combat" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian Arab League was decommissioned, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had been in favour of a resignation by President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan yesterday was the official Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to "submit his power to Syria", in which around 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Baschar were to place the interest of his country in his heart, he would retreat, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts that had been directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who cannot be at peace with their people and who cannot be satisfied with this must go," he said in a statement to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily more harsh attitude.
The United States has, for its part, confirmed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's mechanisms" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in view of the repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in the sheltered city of Homs at the time of "Shoot change and heavy bombing of Jobar".
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Minister of Foreign Trade Walid al-Mulim was still the view that the country "taxed at the end of the crisis".
He has, however, responded with emphasis on the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which represents his assessment of a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give up", he added under the assumption that "the plots against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression, after which he was confined to his "Paranoia".
An overplanning new assembly of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the escalation of the crisis on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, foreseeable withdrawal of the military troops from the siege cities and the release of detainees demonstrators.
Russian Minister Sergey Lawrow considered the Arab League's decision to be "uncorrect" yesterday in order to protect itself against any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already reminded Syria of the implementation of the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to prepare for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian government chief, has taken a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet into Parliament, which consists relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti talked about an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The talks will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of lines, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the anxious nervousness of stock markets and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it is "sure that the markets will be decent and wise".
His order by the President was confirmed by the market entry, but the restlessness had increased again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister is expected to set up a staff consisting of major technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only be estimated by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself to working as a "new protagonist" in Europe as a matter of urgency since taking up his role.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change itself in the light of the new government".
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not reach its target of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the setbacks that have occurred in recent months, has applied for new tough measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of the Italian leaders, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, is also on the need for economic upheaval" as a country that has no growth that cannot respect the deficit benchmarks".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "responsibility challenge" and another "Italy", according to the leading authors.
The gross stranger is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections, as Italy has now reached 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientists help Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-based explosive device, thus confirming on Monday a nuclear-related, U.S. NGO.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recently published report of the IAEA International Atomic Safety Agency and other documents issued by this UN Agency for the detection of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA had reported its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company in Kiev, producing "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he thus participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA referred to "strong evidence that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only too mobile in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency reported, had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin throughout his career."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-based crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have decreased or decreased slightly during the same period.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increased, while 13% of the attacks against Catholics, 4% decreased against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
In very weak Mavere, the total number of "hassed motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences in crimes motivated by crime, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights First organization stressed."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, a responsible of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these abuses," he added, under the assumption that this could be done in improving the police's attitude towards the "hass crimes".
The "hass crime" is represented in U.S. federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish rapists who are targeted against race, skin color, religion or descent and are now also involved in crimes of sexuality.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" enable better readable live performance of the activities of other "twitterers", the internet user whose news ("Tweets") is being followed and who follow your messages.
This allows us to determine whether they allow us to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"August at a low percentage of users", Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, made up of something esoteric asmutendem Wordlaut (RT to the referenced return of someone else's contributions). follow Friday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiatives happy, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" over the Internet.
"It's useless, urgent and equal to too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "activity" function will help me better track certain elements of my stream Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Enactment of a "Golden Budgetary Rule" in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the ruling government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian Top Bond (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although Austria's public debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay did not fall on a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros every year for interest," argued Michael Spindlegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister Auven.
Austria also holds a request for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have required the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The adoption by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
Until 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually, from 2017 onwards, the Federal State's structural budgetary deficit should not exceed the 0.35% GDP threshold, whereas regional countries should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the monetary markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would again intervene in the monetary markets if the Yen should continue to rise.
"If we were to attach excessive volatility" to the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up close to the historical level that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which has been in the process of setting a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has increased regularly over this, which has been absorbed by the purchase of investors who consider the yen as "future value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro dropped below the 105 yen symbolic latte near the level that had upset the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was recorded at the 120 yen, the euro being more than 160 yen.
This current fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the Archipelago, as it appreciates the costs of "made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income derived from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east) for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who is afraid that this price of the yen may kill the weak recovery already in progress.
The third economic power has grown by -1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter – for the first time this year thanks to the leaping export increases and the consumption of the "luminised" households once again.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the price of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its Monetary Policy Committee, to seize all the earthly efforts to disengage the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, however, noted that BoJ had already initiated "appropriate acquisitions" so that he could be trusted that no additional currency closure would be expected on Wednesday.
At the end of the last meeting in October, the notary bank had increased its public debt purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to add the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) to cover amounts it had applied for various purchases of financial securities in order to overcome the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet fast in height, stock exchanges make retreat
The risk of the debt crisis persists indefinitely with the European figures.
Despite the accession of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges that are still concerned with the stability of the euro area are also operating this Tuesday, on 15 November, a little more in negative fields.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions on the return on government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only aware of the risk of inflammation," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Press Agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, for its part, suffered from the renewed fear of market participants regarding Europe's capacity to sustain the debt crisis, had closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency that continues its base on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a period of a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, leaving it at 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, she withdrew after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met at the Congress on Monday, had made an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish councils are far below the 6% limit.
The loans of Italy and Spain are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the income of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% at 10 years of age, with those of the Spanish title growing to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern but also in France continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market view as the country's parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The interest rate ("spread") between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expected euro area growth figures
Statistics show an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the base of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most economic experts are concerned about.
Germany, for its part, had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first euro area account is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to reflect on this topic as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it examines the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a double demand for electricity by 2050, it should not be a huge part of the world's population to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the depletion of fossil resources in order to continue to produce sustainable electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue to pursue their projects with determination to name only a few countries.
The United States has decided, on its side, to join their park for another unit by re-launching the Three Mile Island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model is occasionally set as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will result in an increase in the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports, in particular Russia, resulting in an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European wind power table guide, from which 30% of its electricity is related; on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, which is used with wind energy, and on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a finding of industrial stability at national level, the French companies benefit from the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, resulting in the noble statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Survey showed that the price that the large majority of the French are willing to pay is as little as it would show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are aware that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them a number of jobs for creators.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would fall victim to it and the annual €6 billion of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would be reduced more and more.
What electrician would require a 60-year-old EPR to operate if its producer's downturn was pre-programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that as little as a devil's work there is a miracle to generate electricity.
The CO2-poor solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, which have become a name because of their professionalism, are just to be filled with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disruptions.
Only one, even in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; thus he suffered no consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was pledged by reactor construction as well as innocent, human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The core industry will draw its lessons from this accident, as it had done in the past.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the safety authorities of French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a construction op in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them free train to travel to the leading position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotional, dogma and party leaders to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised for many ways - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a policy that was subject to the figures, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had done.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students on the official side had marked the weekly sights, which the Minister of Interior had announced in the interim (see Liberia of 23 May) that France did not need "talents, maurels or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
This is the subject of a broad consensus between the right and the left.
On the right-hand side, the sound of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left-hand side, by Michel Rocard, who had shown in 1990, could not take up the whole poverty of the world.
The only difference is the degree of gravity
The fear of invasion of the national soil by the hordes of Polish climbers was divided in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were seen as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that immigrants are willing to face.
In his programme Francois Hollande restricts itself to banalities that suggest partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recently published work that summarises the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local labour force, in particular those who are less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic workers, as they are heavily engaged in jobs in sectors that are technically unencumbered.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local workers do not travel, which are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the labour supply.
Positive Payoff
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, this complementarity between local and migrant workers also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in immigration flows would lead to a significant long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this is without regard for the fact that the diversity of ideas imported by immigrants and economic growth is affordable (high proportion of immigrants living in the United States among Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute netly to the social systems, in the European countries on average at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000 over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing interfaces "with the teeth" to his mandate.
These said teeth, which should scare immigrants, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the tragedies of the first world war, totalitarianism, Holocaust, gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy occupying its enemies for all time.
It has been known since Napoleon that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also be well described as a "repressive instrument", as was expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of violence, a training, education, an economic and social community, a case law.
The crisis in Europe in which we are living is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek true-false referendum would have been double-exclusive in this regard: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those who are troubled by its impossibility, its impossibility.
This ambivalentity should be considered to be obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A break for the European single-minded or a jump with connected eyes into the void of nationalistic retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a hack bee, but a collective task, from full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you no longer know where to stop the census - since there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is committed to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - this is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and so each of its member nations.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
Because it is entirely up to Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to look to the future through investment.
The rise from the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition that cannot be liked without total democratic legitimacy, without necessarily leading us to ruin.
After many years of combating this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing for European economic governance.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they intend for the citizens - would be a new folly and another bagpipe.
We need to take up a new stage of European construction.
In order to bring the Republic into existence in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chips cards will be for the general good
On Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the world fair for charts opens its doors in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most durable segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation for purchases by simply keeping the card on a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million unplugged chips cards should be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chipmap market (6,925 million cards).
Europe will win over the uncontacted payment of land after a long period of suspension of the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 visa-free visas have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contacts without Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two gross French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers in the future, which have no contact with the chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
A declining percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should at least experience a real upward development next year."
"We count in 2012 with sales of 80 million to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows no contact payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale had also said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that enables its customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front is understood, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The relations already under suspicion between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Prime Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria had now achieved "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations deal with and the relationships of the secret services point to clear cooperation," he said without further details.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have promoted interfaces to days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's followers, were supposed to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips that belonged to terrorists in the dumps at the site of use.
Terroristaxe
The analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several conversation partners who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the road of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but one must undoubtedly expect more clear evidence before one can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's conceivable, however."
"It has been known for years that the sector has been engaged in financial and intellectual support of Auven and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the demands as well as the operation modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the withdrawal of suicide killers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been exerting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact considered the grouping to be an Illuminati community for a long time, which should not be given particular attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Joseph - which in Haoussa means so much as "the Western Education is a shame" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirates in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this media-free region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It politicises and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while its activists are involved in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the viewer.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram proved to be particularly active with their increased attacks on the Office of the Commissioner.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual undifferentiated.
The army surrounds the city, you count 800 dead.
The prisoner Mohammed Joseph is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its castles in the north.
Last Christmas she was known for an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, so to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is attributed to a suicide warrant that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters headed the leading international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to take all security experts from Mauritania to Somalia.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis operating al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week Alain Juppé had warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria against Boko Harem and was ready to give all the information."
World against the Republican presidential candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and ignorance with respect to China, Iraq and Israel.
Can a crisis-depressed America be a complex world with simple, not to say: a complex idea?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, the middle of Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their rivals have repeatedly made their generous statements and their statements on Auven politics, the traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel help fall - often underwalled in no way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course, Middle Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to point them at the "Money Manipulation" - a leading theme in a America that is driven to the top by the migration of all industrial sectors to Asia.
Stupid run when this is supposed to imply the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auven politics, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotional charm.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive exchange with Beijing (also the current Obama position).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he is stagnant in the depth of the polls.
Reagan's Equation
Romney had also pledged military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme should fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm offering Iran content," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
Furthermore, he promised increased military assistance to Israel and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, is, in turn, showing a shameful lack of knowledge of the facts.
Recently he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, as Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to have noticed the fact that China has been in possession of nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, stands ready to serve the U.S. Army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The attack on torture by Obama in 2009 against alleged terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auven political weight.
Against the current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and nevertheless won the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine, which was the subject of terrorism.
They maintain right on the failure of his naive twin conversations with Iran, the earlier withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so much forced.
The population estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, it has been on guard against military intervention that leads to the elaboration.
And Obama is surprised by his argument that America had to be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership position to a new life.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted this event to take place with splendor and glory.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have been living on the Baltic Sea Coast last Tuesday under orchestral noise and at fine-sweet buffet the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically combined the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, additional Russian gases of 27.5 billion cubic metres per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, connecting the region of St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - equivalent to French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already anchor the possibility of building a third line on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction works is like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any passage through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
This is why these two countries are losing a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not reluctant to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has almost five years to complete its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries with strong gas consumption and fluctuating their gas emissions.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon in the opening of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gasprom manager represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, in about 200 m deep.
In its construction, mine fields dating from World War II had to be balanced.
"Approximately a hundred mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased catches were required to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long tube of metal, hard like 242 eiffel Towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in front of the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took a distance from it, as the Swedes were not aware of the fact that a Russian state company would sit permanently at the height of its coasts.
"In case of an accident, we close the gas pass in less than one minute," Jens Müller said.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors as only unlikely, as the swivel knots were estimated to be resistant to a leak per 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation by a marine vessel, as well as by a device operating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, weighs a meter diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the wire at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo only the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to carry out this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E.ON and BASF are included here (up to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French company group GDF Suez (up to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is commissioned with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has thus rented the full capacity of its gas transport, namely on the extension of the 20th anniversary contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how gross the actual transporter gas volume falls," Jens Müller said.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are keen to reintroduce their statements, since Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas line comes to a sandy, pine forested coastal line near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas austritsforte.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the occurring gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal is delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour as well as 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to reinvent the writing style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelights brought with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular insert, its rubber band, the oval-coloured pages, as aged over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, however, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company modo modo, which has its seat in Milan, at the time decided to place a distinguished design note on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's expert advisor, is commissioned to introduce the new product into the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique, called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which is called a cotton lacquer, which is used, for example, for the reference of pulse banks.
This kind of notebook was very asked by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has raised an old and almost forgotten object which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artist," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Mode.
Success has been achieved.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and were established by a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyers, since the notebook also inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultural and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which numbered 12 employees at the beginning, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers, and understands how to implement its identity.
"We follow the spirit of time and its new writing needs, which exists despite the uplifting of e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Transway)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a connection with Leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood it to diversify his products: pockets, timetables, fillers, computer holes... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings down the plan: In autumn 2006 Mode was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and a new chapter appeared in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers at such a high level?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" starts.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% compared to 9% of the total population.
Discouragement?
"No, that's what Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association Adapts, is saying, "The Week of Work for the Disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nonetheless, there's still a huge deal to do."
However, it has to be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled people before they get a job.
More common are the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% of them do not have an Abitur and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% on the average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-integrate and that make up the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which is helpful in recruiting disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
Remains unspoken, the mental attitudes that are certain but slowly develop.
A study conducted by the association IMS-Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité, conducted in April, stated that the managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about the disabled", which "overrepresented" is "by people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minorities".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a broad way forward to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as defined in a 1987 Act.
These last-mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is responsible for making contributions from companies that did not respect this law.
The evidence: The number of "payers' fees" has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also makes a real impression, especially in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the workplaces between 20 and 49 employees were disabled, while companies with between 100 and 199 employees were 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Service Day (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not cured their pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would have been too far-reaching to claim there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Side by side on the stage of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace well and gladly.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had not taught anything as a praise to his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native liller assures him.
What's the contrast between his presentation in club and national self"It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year long, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, released on Friday against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without leaving the note of "satisfaction".
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7, leading its victorious troops between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We've just been on our way."
"Fighting them to play means gross happiness!"
It seemed that he had a good feeling of "stolz".
"The pride of a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbourhood" that France "has again become a team at a very high level", which is little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician seems to share the plane with the blues (the French national elf) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out rough," he stressed.
"We are planning a thing that the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." The game is involved against France.
Portugal very reliable
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with great optimism the replay against Bosnia (2:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
For example, both teams were lacking in business.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selectçao", his national elite, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
In fact, for Portugal this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and to serve a opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the example (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the worms have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to push the thing into the most important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"That's a good result, but it's a certain risk, because we haven't got an outer space store."
At home, however, in their bright city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of a public who should be as high on the game, even if the party was of course announced as "very short", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
The undecidedness of Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a door.
An indecision can already suffice the Bosnians who also need a door.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk, because we haven't got an outer store," says Bento.
"We will come against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
