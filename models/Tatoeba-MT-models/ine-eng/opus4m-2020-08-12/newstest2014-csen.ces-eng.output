Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money on repairs that are tearing down the road network, many are starting to see solutions in a small black box that easily enters your car’s device board.
The devices that monitor every kilometer that the driver is driving and that transmit this information to the authorities are the core of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renew the outdated system of financing American highways.
Usually the fake design of the railways has suddenly sparked intensive debate and the emergence of the most diverse companies.
The Liberians met with groups of environmentalists and were hoping that the government could use these small boxes, which would record the miles and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to collect the tax measure.
Tea party's scared.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can move to the system in which the driver pays for a kilometer of the road he is going after during the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It's not a matter of when we can choose a lot," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, who plans to start monitoring every California motorist in 2025.
It will change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
The fact is that the Road Trust Fund financed from taxes that the Americans pay at the pumping stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
The cars will drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians hesitate to raise taxes by just one cent.
"The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device up to 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"From a long point of view, it turns out to be the most logical alternative," he said.
The experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles.
There is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea because taxes can be used to change drivers' behaviour patterns, for example, which can help to limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California's designers look into this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Representative of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for miles.
"It's not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President for the Strategy in Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers, who in 2011 invited Congress to take a pay-per-kilometre approach.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which included about 10,000 cars.
However, the screening of representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of the rural lawmakers representing the population, whose daily life often means hurting many kilometres for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving ahead on their own.
The hottest is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes for miles, instead of taxes for gasoline.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no.
New York's just investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight cars.
And Coalition I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have a proponent.
In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, the drivers were concerned by the government’s ability to monitor each of their movements.
"The concerns regarding the monitoring of Big Brother and similar matters were a major problem," said Alaudin Khan, who runs the management of the strategy and operation at the Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the United States Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these facilities into fully-fledged monitoring facilities.”
There is no need to build a huge, difficult-to-reach technological infrastructure that is constantly expanding to the record of daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
The accident is one of those several states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles the vehicle will take, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hon has brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was initially not involved in the government's aid action in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging market with legal liability insurance where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they eat.
But this device, which is trying, attracts the attention of road network designers, because it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using modem.
"People will be more willing to do so if you don't follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
Some of these pilot programs have revealed a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less tangible ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any facilities and instead they will decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, it is hoped that the prudent public will come to this concept if the device is more skilled, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay charges for parking hours in addition to providing insurance according to the kilometres concerned and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to participate in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's project document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussion about pay per kilometer is not just a huge problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the San Francisco Gulf area say Congress might have a problem with the banked Road Trust Fund much easier to resolve by raising the tax on petrol.
One-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles who do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when you are rich enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
ČSSD negotiates on Saturday.
Social democracies are talking and planning a common process together, people and grandparents.
If the social democrats fail within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly dedicated partners, who will put on the table a complete list of requirements including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then either gather the acidic coalition horrors, or wreath on the garden minority government.
On Saturday, after four days of being carried on the wave of sympathy, he first came across.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political body and mainly forced the convicted liar to resign.
The approved negotiator is still only he, the other members of the team will be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the jury and now to the citizens.
He doesn't lie, in his personal life, or in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hasek after negotiating the southernmost management of social democracy.
He added that he doesn't belong in the first vice president's office.
"I will communicate my decision to the UVV on 10 November," Hašek said.
Similarly, ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and head of the Jeroný Tejc parliamentary club spoke.
However, he warned that he was elected just two days ago.
Both Members then declared that they would do everything in their power to make the ČSSD fifty-member club sound one vote.
The absurd theater he put on the crown of Michal Hasek saying: "I am a member of the ČSSD fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
Another lie in direct transmission.
Or, at the invitation of Saturday's resignation and his expulsion from the negotiating team, did he forget that August's UVV was 57 percent on the idea that God'slav Sobotka was a candidate for the Prime Minister's party?
The head of the ČSSD, however, produced a powerful army of enemies by the permission of the UVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to stream out the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media of the most varied guts and fam, possibly recall the real errors of the Sobotk's political career.
There will be a powerful washing of dirty clothes, signs of dark alliances between Zdena Bakal's coal bar and the Sobotk's wing will appear.
The friendly relationship of God's slave Saturday and the influential lawyer Radka Pokorno will be discussed.
There are disputes between the ČSSD and the Yugoslav or Moravian organisations.
The warnings are the words of the island primacy and the Sobotk allies of Petra Kaynar: "I have signed Charter 77 so that the countries do not rule idiots."
If ÚVV met this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will shake their heads with ashes and stay.
And right now, the winning chief of the ČSSD will end with the last name of Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russian is challenging
The lips of his mouth point to an inexhaustible smile, and then he just sighs deeply: "It's stressful."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Soči 2014 Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works anyway," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things work slower and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on the basics no longer so much.
It may take us three months to add to the official marking of individual villages so that we can do a whole series of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
There's still communication in a number of things.
Is there at least a delivered Olympic village?
But it's no longer a catastrophic state.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Good luck with the houses.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you think the floors are ready?
It's just the base concrete, so it was a state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a front, it will still feel sticky there.
And if they don't pull, then what?
President Putin would you like to push the army there?
That's how it's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic village = the native village.
They're more at risk of not reaching for, for example, road adjustment, not detailing.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we're gonna have to take the hollins from the London games.
But I believe they're kind of putting it in the shop.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the Krasbers will be able to go in the three they've gone.
There is no doubt about the fast browser Martin Sáblík, either, but otherwise it's in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
We know what houses in the Olympic village look like.
We even measured some things by a meter so that we wouldn't believe just the designs.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the Soči organizational committee.
Putin promised the organic Olympics, his plan hates huge secret treasures.
Winter sports fans are already cutting off a meter to launch the Olympic Games in Soči, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, although starting in February, are meeting another scandal.
According to the Russians, it is not possible to fulfill the promise that the preparation and performance of games will not affect the nature of the Krasnodar region in the foothills of the Caucasus, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will die.
The rest of the Olympics in Vancouver had a very high Russian doll, and Canadian games were recorded as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
It seems, however, that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize the games with "zero waste" has long since taken its place.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a huge structure of construction material in the village of Achstyr near Soči.
So the building materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foams were found in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have gone mad and the warehouse is gone.
Just for a second.
Last week, the reporters were given a view of the three-scattered football band.
Not the only one, in the area of such places, is the British newspaper The Times.
The site is operated by Russian railways, a state monopoly that builds about 60 kilometres between the airport in Soči and the sports resort.
The company, which already had 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin's collaborators, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended the installation of one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyra, all around three months of the day and night they've been driving trucks full of waste.
According to experts it threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymt, other rivers and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates soch water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev of the EWNC environmental non-profit organisation said.
Illegal settlements are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison: The games in Soči will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics will amount to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London amounted to only 19 billion and the above mentioned Vancouver's nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears, if there is enough snow at the end, there have also been reports that there is no respect for human rights when working on a sports exhibition and infrastructure.
Last month one of the employees slammed his mouth to protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many are also afraid of how the Russian organizers match the new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the game.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gay at the Olympics.
A young couple grew up to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese Tai and Associates studio was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somewhat linked.
The requirement further stated that two generations would live together in the house, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly connected land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household into one of the floors of the house.
"In making the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories connected to the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected by several journeys through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of parents is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are respected.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they are different from the different final façades.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, the surface of which was constructed by panels of wires, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remain in pure concrete construction without any further adjustments.
Many of the walls of the house are completely covered, making the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior to the exterior will shake off the side wall, which starts on the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
A young couple enter the house with the main entrance into the hall and then step up the stairs into their space.
The steps are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their design enables them to break down a lot of natural light through them.
That's exactly what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from the others and impress him with something unique.
The home of the young couple is treated as an open space with a kitchenette, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, it is divided by only a glass wall with a sliding door.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely walks on the terrace, from which there is a nice view of the Tokyo Gulf.
The office itself at the highest level is conceived in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enter the house with the main entrance, head into the entrance hall, and then walk up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, it's for Zeman and ODS.
Over the past few months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and senior and senior schools in several countries to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign that President Milos Zeman conducted at the schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rectors of the University of Masaryk in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, even received an address in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the Czech Republic's state festival.
Here is a list of the representatives of schools that were no longer able to board and visit Miloše Zeman: High Technical Education in Brno, High School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolina, University of J.E. Purkin in Ústí nad Labem.
We now meet in Pardubice to continue to promote policy in high schools.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function, and in addition it seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you'd stayed, for example, in the role of the mayor of a smaller city.
Would you like to join the ČSSD Heitmans, who are also acting as a Member and a Heitman, as well as they are degrading both professions?
That's why you're telling people they can handle both of these demanding functions on the left-hand side.
I know, we have an example here of Michal Hask, who manages even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly the example of the person you should be driving.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Frankova, who prefers to leave the parliamentary post so that she can devote herself fully to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the function of the deacon is that in the course of the functions you violate the apolicity of the academic territory of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubic ODS sees your current effect on both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you'll be able to help without being a dean.
I think the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your departure and maintain your face.
Otherwise, you may find that your voters are counting on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovic's bubbles, the chemicals don't add to it
More than a thousand tons of acidic weeds want to be produced in the Slovak Fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group in the coming months.
The season here began in October and will last about half a year.
A healthy smell here since 1925 is still produced in a traditional way, i.e. smoking directly in big dances.
In modern industrial times, it's a rarity.
Our staff found a change almost ten-mile route.
In each of the ten tanks, there will be 15 to 30 tons of greenery, one filling takes three shifts," said the head of the Slovak Frut David Kladrob Competition.
Greenheads drive to the company area directly from their fields farmers mainly from Ostrožska and Bréclavska.
Fruit workers then clean the vegetables, remove the tiles and throw them into the bowl.
From there, already grounded herbs fall into six-metre deep pools, where they work tirelessly in white clothes and hooligans.
That's what makes the unwelcome air tighter.
The last layer of greenery is covered by the flag and weighs on water.
"The green herb will then grow for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milking without any additives supporting herbing," said Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to domestic production, and individual layers of workers spray salt and foam.
He wants to go to the filling line after drying.
It is packed in a sugary left into bags or glasses and is processed for sterilization.
Hamé delivers acidified herbs primarily to the foreign and Slovenian markets.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a former U.S. rapporteur, announced his willingness to go to Berlin to provide evidence to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Srübele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum and discussed the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
Mr Snowden's letter, which the honourable Member passed on to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: "Although the result of my efforts has been proved positive, my government continues to act as a fugitive and tries to criminalise political manifestations by heavy complaints that do not give room for defence."
But telling the truth isn't a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw the charges against it.
The accusations raised by the United States Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to the newspaper Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible.”
The tension in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when it became apparent that the NSA was listening to Angela Merkel's office phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament, who is running a parliamentary panel monitoring the report, said that if there was any chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without exposing himself to danger and completely destroying relations with the United States", this should be done.
Mr Srêbele, the MP of parliament on the German Greens, published on his Twitter contribution a photo on which he is with Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists escorted her on their way to Russia.
Mr. Srübele said that according to former NSA attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe", said a member of Parliament.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his "political expression" added courage to him.
Citizens from all over the United States, including those in the United States, have assessed the disclosure of an unreasonable system of universal public monitoring.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent. The Red Khmerians are being beaten.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
The Rudish Khmer government, which in 1975 to 1979 opposed the mixture of mosaic and nationalism, died as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of that population.
To this end, the leader of the notorious S-21 prison has awarded the 2010 life sentence to the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, kidnapping and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan were afraid that they believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and didn't know what the real extent of the killing was.
"It is easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and then touch and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said on Thursday before the court.
You really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea stated that he never ordered the Red Khmers to " treat people badly or kill them to refuse food or smell genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, said AFP could not accept the excuse of Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"Just wants to get rid of the guilt."
"It's not about the second," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his subjects wouldn't have killed," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than the monster."
He was also supposed to be the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer Ieng Sary regime, which died this year in March.
In September 2012, his wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was sued by the court for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the storage of the handbag on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 per hand luggage and USD 2 per cup of coffee or soda, although they said in their announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to leave the whole box.
The new fee for the handbag covers the luggage in the upper deck so that small bags under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier says it will account for 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD if the passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokesperson said that a fixed-term fee should encourage the traveller to take care of the payments in advance.
"We don't want to choose this fee," she said.
The airlines started to charge the first and second instalments in 2008.
Travelers tried to avoid these charges and went into handbags hidden in the spare room as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this room.
Fees are one way of teaching passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that, in the sense of this new fee, it really isn't getting any more money.
It is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top position is increasingly difficult.
Travelers who buy their flights on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's front door can bring a bag for which he does not pay anything, while the other passenger in front for the same baggage will pay $100.
O'Malley said that websites and removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before their arrival at the gate.
The new Frontier fee will not be valid until the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travelers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage is worth money, and the passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider another charge for baggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
But most of the charges for handbags were not met.
Spirit Airlines was the first to pay for handbags three years ago and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, later followed its example.
The only company that also has such charges is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air traffic advisor Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for Spirit’s handbags would be $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and wondered what he saw at the door when the passengers met the unusual fee of Spirit for a hand luggage.
"It was the fastest thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I've been waiting for me to see a toothpaste and a fight at the door.
The plane was full, he said, "and the entrance was in the brain".
Frontier will also pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that travellers who get lemonade or juice can leave the entire cup of coffee and the coffee will be added free of charge.
The water will continue to be given free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to introduce drinks charges, but after the complaints from passengers seven months later and no other significant airline was able to imitate it.
The last move of Frontier to pay a handbag if the traveller does not buy flights directly from this airline, its last attempt is to direct customers directly to its website.
Air carriers pay to online travel sellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each airline sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went as far as possible into this area.
In September, she started giving customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the framework of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the wages by 25 per cent of the mile of the trip.
So the trip with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased through the Internet Travel Agency means a 250-mile reward.
Customers are also allowed to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase directly via Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is starting to collapse and lose money.
According to the financial results of the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, the markets fell by 9 per cent and the transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier, as well as the sale of this airline.
The NSA's website does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that her website for a few hours last week had fallen due to internal failure, not to the attack of hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov pages were not accessible tonight for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by an attack by DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server recorders noticed that NSA websites didn't work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Earlier NSA spokesperson ABC News reported that internal sensitive networks of agencies were not "at all" at all.
The spokesperson said no classified information was in danger.
At least one group of Internet hackers claimed to be responsible for removing NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are loaded and the site is not dropped.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA Superintendent Agency, which once received the nickname No such agency, has become the focus of foreign and domestic surveillance programmes in recent months, with the focus of public attention and the aim of partial criticism, in general, of the withdrawal of NSA secret files from the Agency and their disclosure by former staff member Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency led to a previous speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profits fell as a result of the decrease in supplies and orders
The Canadian manufacturer of Bombardier aircraft and trains announced on Thursday a 15 per cent decrease in net profit due to a smaller number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and to contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also did not publish any data on the flight test for its new CSeries type aircraft, nor did it offer any relevant information as to whether this aircraft would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from the next September.
After the start of the pilot flight about a month and a half ago, the plane only flew three times and there was a question as to whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not fill the estimates and stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange decreased by 8 per cent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced on Thursday the rating from "higher performance" to "execution of the sector" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"As the smaller the aircraft delivery we expected most of the time, we were greatly disappointed by the profit range in the transport sector," Doerksen told customers in the report.
As the pilot program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries aircraft orders.
However, if no new orders are notified in the coming months, we assume that there will be a market gap towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the lower market area, which is now dominant in Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and after a few months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders of CSeries reaches a modest level of 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this aircraft.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach 300 mandatory orders when the first aircraft was introduced for commercial use.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is being carried out in accordance with the plan.
"The pilot aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin in a conference call and noted that ground testing and software updates were planned during the flight.
Every producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first year and then focus on updating, and we did.
That'll happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five testing aircraft should be taken off in the coming weeks and shortly thereafter.
Analysts are skeptical, however, that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier submits that it assessed its operating plan and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – although in accordance with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
Out of 172 million USD or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter ending 30 September, the net profit of Bombardier fell to 147 million USD, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted earnings for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover has decreased marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that, contrary to 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were added during the quarter.
Clear orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aviation division amounted to $32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results of the flight were in line with our outlook, but the low revenue of orders and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The output in the aviation industry fell by 13 per cent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said that the profits in this division grew by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is the opposite of marginal growth on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several major contracts.
Leaders indicated that new views would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share, which also announced Google's financial director Patrick Pichette's arrival, dropped by 8.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon during the trade.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday a ten per cent fall in quarterly profits.
A drug addict who warned a mafia before the police investigation is in prison
Bashart Ditta (42) was to transmit information to King Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense officer who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Bashart Ditta (42) had, after becoming suspected of cocaine use, informed the chief of the sublight of Neil Scarbrough about the investigation of his drug addiction activities.
The lawyer whose last name was "Bash" (party) and who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested at his home in 2011.
Cops watched Sarborough (32), as he left at the lawhouse in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues from Law Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his money, and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular drug user of class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of police raids held heroin and cocaine worth some GBP 1.5 million together with GBP 200,000 in cash, 32 more people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals for the fear that his dependence on cocaine would come.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors legal company with a seat in Blackburn, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when after three weeks he was found guilty of defending the exercise of justice in two cases.
During his previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's fall occurred after a police investigation of Scarborough found that he was in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspects were watching him, recording his arrival at Ditt's house, and watching him put 60 percent of the drugs in a black golf glove under the law.
Next, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two.
In court it was reported that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, money and credit cards and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but he denied the use of cocaine and said that he was talking to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation fell into "confidential communication".
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract a few credit cards from it, but all were detained and his hair samples were taken.
In a police inquiry, he said that he was operating both at his home address and at his workplace, and that his clients were visiting him at home for business.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented to inform them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne White said: “Who else knows that he must not violate the law than the law enforcement officer in the criminal field? ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The issue we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal relationship of a client lawyer.
Police investigation has dreamed as much as possible of allowing them to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, but he insulted her.
With some of his clients he got too close, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta rejected the crime and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away.”
However, after hearing police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta, from a law representative in the criminal field, became a criminal himself at the time he began to get drugs from organised criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups who were tasked with collecting valuable information on police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of impartiality, and they must raise public confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cover of his profession.
The Unit for Serious and Organized Crimes in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted for three cases of cocaine detention and now for preventing the exercise of justice, demonstrating our obligation to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and we'll stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of socializing for the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta organized an online conversation about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be legally represented by clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for work he would point out injustice.
He was negotiating a government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasala sent against Babish.
People have won fourteen Members in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of the UN.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to negotiate possible images of coalitions, Jan Kasala - a man who has made the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats don't even have Andrej Babish's matador on their side.
It is likely that this time it will remind us of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal at that time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press driven by controversial media law
"It is a scary report and it is on the spot to ask what Parliament will prevent it from simply blocking the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper quoted the bill as anti-constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most famous independent broadcasting stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be pre-connected because it is an extended government hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Keni's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually transmits "full control of the media" to the government, and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom in Kenya "suffered a strong wound", and criticises the bill as "hard".
The adoption of the bill comes in the midst of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by the Islamic gunman in the shopping centre of Westgate.
The Kenyan media was angry at the authorities when they sent a security camera, on which soldiers were allegedly using luxury goods.
The police director responded so that he had two journalists and the leading media official summoned for questioning, but the call was later downloaded after the press pressure.
Under the new draft law, media companies may be subjected to up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists together with the risk of ‘exclusion from the list’ or may be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to entertain the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one plague enough to eliminate most of the radio stations”.
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when the media shuts down, they can do with impunity what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote a journalist in the National Mutum Mathia newspaper and described Kenyan media as a key source of mutual control and balance in public life.
"When we leave it to politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back into hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the cuts ordered by the National Wages Agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings monthly, which thus ranks to the highest in the world.
He's got to fight, young Czechs know.
Most of them but don't even know what interest rates
More and more Czechs are giving themselves money.
However, they do not reach the champions in the region.
Most of the money is stored by the Prussians, who spend an average of 181 euros a month.
There's more to it than the Czechs are slowing people down in Slovakia.
It comes from an Erste Savings Barometer survey in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the audience is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to make more money.
While the Czechs are around the middle of a barbershop, in Romania and Serbia, people still use very little.
For example, almost every other Serb is slowing down at home under the pillow, according to the survey.
In this year, the number of people who are monthly slowing down higher amounts has risen.
Last year, between a thousand and 2.5 thousand crowns were deposited every month for the most varied type of adjudication, which is five percent more this year.
The average monthly investment in the interannual comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among sporadic products is pension insurance.
This accounts for 54 per cent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for 36 per cent of people.
On the contrary, the structure of the project is declining, and the interest in the investment funds has also fallen significantly in contrast to last year.
You're already using only 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that although people consider it important to slow down, most of them do not know what benefits they achieve on individual products.
Above all, young people under 30 don't know how their money is earned.
On the contrary, the oldest group has the best knowledge of the benefits of its saved money, and 73 percent of people over the age of 50 know that.
In the international comparison of the Erst Česchi group, they lead to the use of online banking, which regularly uses 44 per cent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Skulled with a 12 per cent discount.
UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting to work on a new target file that replaces the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in setting "sustainable development goals" to replace MDGs, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to "get up above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process, which is to implement the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
SDG will build on the progress achieved within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I am making every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that are building on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under Samora Machely, the founder's Mosambian president, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa to protest the peace passwords on a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she exchanged the business clothing for a shirt decorated with the title "requires security" in Portuguese and joined her on Thursday to give her independence in the capital.
Two weeks later, almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, about one of the worst hits since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago, came.
Renamo was once an unpopular rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of the apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of that country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became the opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have caused foreign investors and locals.
There is a rapidly growing economy because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest can bring over the next few years by companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the United States of America an investment worth more than $50 billion.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are accused of the tension.
The Party of Renamo claims that the government caused the last conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional town of the Party of Renamo on 17 September.
The violent attack of former rebels was subsequently carried out when government forces attacked the base of the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhaka, group leader, said for the Financial Times spokesperson for Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing Renamo of causing conflicts because he's been attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate the anxiety of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama saw himself as a "scrupulous" who wanted to use "what remained of his strength to try to prove that the government could direct its own decisions".
Like Frelimo, Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted as saying that the Renamo party departs from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT said it meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our aim is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
The previous discussions between these parties have been conducted to mitigate tensions between these parties, which have been torn apart by a number of flows this year, just a little.
It's a scarf between the two big personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at Open University and an expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, nor is any of them willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which has tried to change the election, has already stated that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort to gain from the government’s advantage and financial advantage.
Since 1992, Renamo's electoral share has decreased, while the newest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo's party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, whose second term ends next year, wants to destroy democracy in this country.
"The democratic system does not want more sides, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace, because it does not want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the side of Renamo has to do, but it has carried out a vicious terrorist attack on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the floods occurred in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on for their coal exports.
In June, Rio stopped for about a week the use of the railway when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development pace and recent kidnapping flood.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country rests solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one who will find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
Thor’s stories may show that “the harsh force cannot be equal to the cleverness, ” while artushov’s legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Most myths would "be too wild for school education, too scandalous and, in some cases, too scrupulous," said Crossley-Holland, who makes himself known for his careful choice of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been planning this plan for 20 years.
He added that "open-minded" authors and teachers are in the case of a storyteller with a "underpray" message for children as "a switch".
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English by Epos Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Beasts, says: "You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself."
The biggest difference between adult authors writing for adults and adult authors writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or ended by a happy man, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be aware; revealed through story, not openly defined.
The old truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
Brennan Star will take visitors to the universe in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the great planetary has changed in the last half of the year.
There is a new scene here, visitors can dive into new comfortable seats, and over their heads came a projection area of an average of 17 meters in the form of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
In order to be perfect, there are other smaller projectors around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall.
"It's twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brinnish Star Office Jiří Dušek.
Computers will make sure that the image from several projectors is not covered, but gives a good impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty-four times higher than that of classical personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík.
Digital can exude the extremely realistic and plastic model of night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers will be so admired directly in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the starhouse plans to propose the purchased order and its own creation in the hall.
There's been two shows since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and intended for adults.
People in it learn about the training of cosmonauts, travel to space, close to centrifuge, and then see in obvious examples how the stress conditions of astronauts in the cosmos are at the front.
The second show is for the children and my name is Magic utes - Kaluoka'hina.
He will tell the story of the ostrich whose pestro-colored inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the outbreak of a nearby volcano occurred.
The entire digital amount was about 50 million crowns, which were paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the starry city of Brno also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was combined with audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which was built two years ago.
According to the director of Duška, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've been studying 11 TICKS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught over 11,000 ads offering jobs, 4300 of which were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62%) online.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 per cent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010) some 60 per cent were set.
The insertion of labour opportunities into one another, according to the analysis, significantly reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison between the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and the period of the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 ads were published in the same follow-up period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is geared towards a narrower line, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, the daily job offer covers a wider range of professions, including those in the workforce, according to the author of the analysis, Pavlín Hästnová.
The representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, the main spots of advertisements were sought by managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representations are particularly useful and professional.
Of course, the most frequently specified requirements expressed by employers through an advertising offer are education.
Other areas followed included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent ads, on the internet in 37 percent.
In just two percent of the ads, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The requirements for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 per cent of ads (in daily print 11 per cent, on the internet 57 per cent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the ads.
Practice requirements are combined with qualified professions.
In particular, it is about leading production and other leading workers.
In particular, in the case of working professions, the author of the Jiří Tillner study complemented the mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and food processors or the repairers of electrical appliances.
Employers shall also indicate in half their advertisements the requirements for the properties and skills of any bidders.
As the most often required skills in advertising, communication skills have long been revealed.
Employers also require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that New York City is the place where a solo comic show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the curator Frank Frey, who worked as the chairman of the theatre ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to assembled people by means of a method of conversation.
Fay's innovation expanded over the years, most recently through the New York comedy festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy Carolines Institute, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theatres.
“Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and were successful to the point that they were too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musically comedy performance at Madison Square Garden, on which Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
Just as this festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians attended this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller advertising or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll developed with his sitcom (sweet Pique "League" on the fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but she celebrated herself the fastest-growing series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, angry, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest fans of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks across the street between the two buildings and he says, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The oil price went down to $96 per barrel
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline as concerns about high stocks were expressed in the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy-laundering manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell during the late morning in European electronic commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, 39 cents fell and 5.8 percent remained in October for the month.
Rich oil supplies in the past few weeks have been a burden on the price.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that American stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production led to a greater demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to increase by 7.8 per cent after the two weak decades that followed in the third quarter.
Oil Brent, the indicator for international oil used also by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents for $108.58 per barrel.
Not at all, Mr. Hashku.
We have a unique opportunity to show politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Haszek is released from all political functions and has left the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution reduces the level of political culture that is already so destructive.
Martin Haszek is protected by the promise he has made, but every and every politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what he can promise.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babiš also has the big one, but it is a question of whether it is politics).
A better program promoted by a liar is unbelievable.
He's not apologizing in politics, he's apologizing in politics.
Mr. Hask, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in it, if you have not just said it - you see how complicated it is) you will leave politics on your own, as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be viewed as helpless weak ones who cannot believe words or deeds.
Whether you want to be proud, whether you're missing a man or a lifesaver.
It may seem to you that it is unfair if I only address you, but you are a leader and they are only the lost sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're now trying to close your ears, reassess your strengths, sit down and attack again, but that's how partisans or cowards act.
You're, I repeat, in my eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court of Justice has blocked the regulation concerning the arrest and search of persons by the NY police department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme for persons in the police department in New York and withdrawn the case from the judge.
The second U.S. appeal by the Federal Court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be postponed until the decision on the appeal that the city gave.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution so that it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.
Instead of its conclusion and its amending regulation, it was proposed, including a decision to grant supervision to the police department, which would help to change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Board of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeal court said that the judge had to be dismissed in the event of a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that, as a judge, it had not been able to avoid the opinion of the firm, in part because of a series of media discussions and a public statement, which it openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they resorted to black and Hispanic injustices under their arrest and search program.
It established independent surveillance to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of the pilot programme to test the cameras carried on the bodies in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were refused after the police investigation.
The oral reasons for the city's withdrawal are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching individuals have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
There has been some stop and search for persons for some decades, but the sights recorded under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to the minority, wrote a complaint that became the case of the group’s complaint.
Representatives of the changes to the arrest and search program conducted by the police department in NY argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police community and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
The opponents claim that the changes reduce police morals, but not crime, and that money is wasted, but they do not solve a wider problem when the police are under pressure after the last decade has reduced their numbers by several thousand.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional but reformed the way the police department visited New York.
Five shopping malls meet low attendance
It comes from the data of the real consultancy companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnicas the public is opened The Krakov Business Centre will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Dissatisfaction is about 20 percent of the medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centre towards the locality and the wrong layout, i.e. too much floor or complicated and opaque layout of the passages, possibly dead center," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the leading department of retail properties Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five shopping centers meet low attendance.
Among the main reasons include poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents, or overcrowded market in the place.
Some projects opened up almost completely filled, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and dislikes changing their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres need to make more effort to 'feel' their customers on new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The volume of shopping centres is generally stable according to Sotáka, even at some centers steps, because the tenants were willing in the crisis to discount from rent and rent some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and the average capacity is thus reduced (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouci)," Soták added.
The shopping malls opened in the last two years are located on the market according to Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinence centres', aimed at the purchase and services of daily needs for the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotáka, there is also a place on the foreign market for other shopping centres.
And both for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Cladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, he sees the space for the prepared shopping centre at the Victory Square, and according to him they have clear street potential Na Príkopje and Václavska Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is being intensively developed, allowing traders to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at a favourable rental and operating cost, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, as well as their reconstruction, for example, the reconstruction of the prior business houses, which is heavily affected by good locality," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
Currently, 90 modern shopping centers are located in the Czech Republic, with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of land for rent.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, resulting from the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with the values from Britain and France, leaving the Czech Republic about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson got on the phone to check out the tip
The former editor of news news of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods "to get on the phone, monitor and confront", to confirm the deceptive tip of a loving relationship to which the then Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke, should be involved.
State representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey court said that the news of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper entrusted private investigator Glenn Mulcair to enter Pawlby's voice box and enter her private, but it was heard in court that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The State Representative points out that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who stands in front of the house and hopes that people will catch up, but a person who likes to tell stories to see what they say," said Edis.
He said that the NotW newspapers used three ways of examining stories: getting on the phone, watching and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, tracking, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about getting stuck in the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he does."
The rumors of the loving relationship that Clarke is involved were first caught by the News Department of NotW, when the source, which was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby, was said, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A record of the voice reports received from her phone on at least three occasions was received at the Mulcair House in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of the private investigator where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the time that Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her parents received anonymous phone calls requesting information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former rapporteur-general Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup watched Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, in which he told her: “I got a story that we’re going to publish tomorrow and that Charles and I would like to talk about.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was in the same pattern as in other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the court found that Coulson was confronted by Mr. Blunkett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he was alone with the co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to associate with other people for telephone calls between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to getting on the phone.
The detection of NSAs increases the social paranoia of state surveillance
One quiet day by the end of August, a German police helicopter was raiding the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
The purpose of the mission was to organize photographs of the cover of the U.S. pre-deployed surveillance, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank, to the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV).
The German media claims that the BfV was hoping to be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action led to an exchange of views between the US and German foreign minister in Berlin.
In September, U.S. Director of National Reporting, James Clapper once again argued that the United States did not use its foreign reporting opportunities “to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies and thus increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker as an informant, has begun to discover his valuable collection from the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether to trust the Director's words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has conducted espionage in Brazilian oil companies and has gained access to the data provided by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, a general paranoia of state monitoring of new dimensions has been achieved.
The last drop came with the discovery that Angela Merkel's clerk's phone might have been answered for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then it is certainly the potential target of the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by EY, German companies are convinced that in the case of industrial espionage and data theft, the US is now at the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden so far that the United States has transferred the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own company.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the field of IT and the Internet and stated that efforts should be made to limit its dependence on the US:
The front entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
The German Parliament is calling for votes to be made by German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them up slowly...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany goes down from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
The scope and technical feasibility of the American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is for some companies that have so far thought that the biggest threat from monitoring represents China, yet shocking.
There is a large turnaround in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have widely realized that the data stored in the United States falls under that jurisdiction and are therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the business community Cloud security alliance about 10 per cent of non-American members after the discovery of the US Prism data-sharing program cancelled the plans to use a cloud provider based in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the SAP Directors General, says: "We have a new question for customers who were not here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to cut their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at any price.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is not surprising.
It always did.
"It has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the Agrochemical Society BASF.
Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken to prevent the attacker from benefiting.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or keeping an unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a representative of Audi, says that it has been a practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the meeting of the representative so that they can not be used as a listening device.
The German BfV Office advises the managers to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be mistrusted.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be fired.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany many of these companies in their specific areas are leading representatives of the global market.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," warns BfV in its report.
The United States is warning its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, National Intelligence Estimate has introduced in February France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of offenders involved in the hacker activity for economic reports, which is right behind China.
A member of the Council in a German risk-free society concluded that in the case of economic espionage, "they are the worst in France".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: “Services know very well that all countries, although working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a young boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a young boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a sad fighting spirit in his high school gym, believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11th in a spirit of balance behind the halls of the gymnastics high school where he went.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old rejects it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump for FoxNews.com, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and also healthy understanding," Crump said.
They feel that this should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“As usual, their son was sent to school and he came back to ask for dead people,” he said.
State representative Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and he noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a criminal act?
declared Moore at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the facts, no matter where they tell me.
My goal is to find the truth.
"I believe that there is sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink indicated that Johnson died as a result of "post-suppression".
The second drink, however, according to Moore, gave another cause of death.
"There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if, in the event of Johnson's death, he reveals enough evidence for an order to investigate a crime or a violation of civil rights, he will request the FBI and its implementation.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for any comment on Thursday.
The judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators visited.
Young parents hope that the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC Centre issued guidelines for children's allergy schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a file of guidelines to help with child food allergies at school.
This is the first file of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, because the number of children of school age suffering food allergy is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Centre found that children’s food allergies dropped by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide for schools with information on how teachers and staff should be aware of child allergies to food and how to react to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – the most commonly used automatic injector of EpiPen – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, "It's like somebody's staring at my tongue," "I feel like I've got a hairy tongue" or "I'm a witness to my tongue."
Intersexual children’s parents can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an indistinguishable gender institution.
Newborn children will no longer be classified either as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to introduce any sex for such children and allows them to introduce the sex as "unspecified" or "unspecified" on their family registers.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make a surprise decision for their child to operate for the purpose of sex and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One BBC intersexual said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to stay a slatanine-made doctor, dehydrated and obnoxious.
It is estimated that every year from 2000 children are born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are an intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that are part of a diagnosis of sexual development disorder, covering the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (eggs or vertebrates) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender identification is not fully understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be identified, it is better to use the best available information and to identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-based problems, said that the new German law "looks like a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but most children do not," he said.
Gender determination can be carried out without surgery and then wait for identity to develop.
The knowledge of how sexuality develops in a child is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are homosexual.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not related to sex, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features may occur in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, hair growth, prosthesis and shape, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by inter-sexual and trans-sexual people in the workplace, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to be identified in official documents of male, female or “third sex”.
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first "unmarried" person in June when she won the appeal to leave the status of "unmarried" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports other than M (male) and F (female) and third term X will be available for intersex individuals.
In neighboring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this highly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. Catholic website online was also defined against the German law and wrote: “With the world being drawn to a new state when sex is a question of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning the borders of two other pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also said about the Baby Zone that she would rather see her children have sex when she was born.
"Parenthood itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said for the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the apparent river that had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a chart that could be deleted and re-drawed.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they do not know how their children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to treat children of a different sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, which held the view that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – as parents raised their child – affected the child's genes and hormones and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
The boy’s parents, whose penis was damaged by a miscarriage, recommended that his child be completely castrated, removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he was allowed to re-operate on the boy and marry his wife.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "are using this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared to be "discontent with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but with an indistinguishable sexual device.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he would never live a "satisfying life".
And shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the outside organs and valves and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to the plastic range.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender development disorder (DSD), which protected the body from producing sufficient amount of testosterone to properly develop its sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he changed to man again, took the doses of testosterone, and let the boobs be removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the director of the Legal Group Advocates for informed choice (representatives of the informed election) living in California, is afraid that the German law “calls for caching and stigmats”.
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose “uncertain” for the child," she said.
We're afraid it'll be an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to be included in the third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is going to assign it to her at birth.
It's a battle that a little child should not lead at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "gives authority" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called Androgen Insensitive Syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are bad, Katie's female features developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a workaholic and eggplants.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married, and she works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law gives parents a certain space so that they do not rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out certain tests and to think about it, and it gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you're excited about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It gives the possibility to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that parents bind, because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he is more identical – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk swallowed the entire house with gasoline: he threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension has increased, the fear has grown.
The man began threatening to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police patrols around the area, as well as a fire department from Mladé Boleslavi and a volunteer fire department.
A police negotiator came to the scene, who tried to excuse his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house.
That's how an intervention unit must have entered the house, which damaged and splintered men.
The aggressor then ended his investigation at a youth hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic catchment area.
In the end, the house was filled with gas and sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to the people, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
A man didn't give up on a police negotiator, so he got a warrant.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisor to President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton as a candidate in 2012.
This discovery is the most important sensational book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming books and announced Thursday evening that the president's top collaborators had held an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011 to assess whether Biden's release would help to revive Obama's pale hope of re-election.
According to the National Political Editor for the Times, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials in the campaign and in the White House, the former head of the White House's office, to measure the impact of the move by former foreign ministers on the post of Vice-President Clinton.
The potential change was strictly guarded by the secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval Works.
Only a few of the closest presidential advisers – including Daley, former head of Obama’s Jim Messin’s campaign, and former chief advisors in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was the representative of an effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase Obama's chances.
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've examined a whole series of things intensively, and this was one of them," said Daley.
You can't forget that at that time the president had a terrible sight, so we said to ourselves, "Christian, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized research as "due care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for re-election had put out a lot of investment to see if this move would pay off in the elections.
"There is no such money in campaigns for elections and quality research if something is not really considered," Martin said to AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential karate mix.
While Daley said he didn't think the president had any potential change "was aware", the former head office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book Double Down definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the research on evicting Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice cream that shines in the dark – by using honey.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a shining palm tree.
He came up with the idea when he read an expert consultation on the media, and convinced a scientist in China to make chemical protein that causes lightbulbing.
This freeze reacts with the language of the consumption – increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its exposure.
Chris says the ice shines when he reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and the more you lie down, the more light it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice-cream "Lick me I'm delicious" company, says: "It's a wonderful substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so you get about 2 g of this substance by GBP 200."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice starts to warm.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween, because it's causing this fantastic amazing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the glowing of honey is four times more expensive than gold.
And that's how every penny I get is about £140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is known for its untraditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold.
His next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the fragmented glass of ice that I'm freezing, but I'm counting on some way to do it, and we'll find it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of honey, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time, and introduce ourselves to our neighbors in the dressing room.
Today, I feel like I've become a caretaker.
Two years later, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year is probably no different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), Halloween will be celebrated by most Americans this year – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to go from lost dollars to costumes.
This year they're the last shot of sexy non-living objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be food like pizza, hamburger and carrot.
As far as men are concerned, I expect us to see a lot of zombies as a result of the flow of the dead, and I bet that spacemen from Daft Punk will pull it into our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches are the most sought after.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones to my widow.
In fact, according to the NRF, this year the U.S. spends $330 million on pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as sweetness is concerned, we're not wasting time.
According to Nielsen U.S. company, $1.9 billion will be lost.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey's table, a lattice, sweet milk duds and Twizzlers and Clark's finger.
That's a wonderful report for 41 million calendars who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are going to cross our quarter.
Actually, we're going to buy it during Halloween, and believe me, don't believe it, and we're going to consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, it sells almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing's more typical for Halloween than horrific homes.
They have the best names, such as "Terror beyond the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1200 scary homes that according to the U.S. scare house earns $500 million, and this includes the amazing photos on which you're choking fear and giving your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like will view the photo and write a comment as "you look nice".
And finally, there's a little bit about the shadows.
By the time we were little, Charlie Brown had introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and cutting the canyon is something like decorating the Christmas tree – we do it from a little girl.
Luckily for us the trend "child in anger" started with the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up to cut the dick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Office, US spends about $106 million.
The distillery with a mucous membrane on your front porch is likely to come from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of foam grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdonov from the city of Napa in California and try to cut off their dins weighing almost one tonne.
Notified series of Land Rover racing
The interior has race seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercoms.
The options include perfect brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between each race.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the races that come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an affordable way to the world class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way of taking advantage of various racing disciplines in Britain and abroad, and that it will prepare competitors for the strength and reality of the Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February as well as a possibility to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have an early election
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is awaiting further early elections.
A week after the last interview for Aktuálná.cz, he said that there is no other East and every government is leaving the vote last Friday and Saturday is impossible blind.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life span of the beginning of the election period is estimated to be up to two years.
With the objection that voters will vote next time in a completely different way, they do not agree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not allow his party to lose voters in other elections as of this year (approximately 300 thousand votes were cast against 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that the early elections will take place, it will strengthen the UN movement 2011 Andreje Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after the hidden Lansing meeting of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Hasek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg:
"The leading officials of the democratic party how small boys go to the head of the state to allow them to turn to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I didn't see anything so recklessly stupid done in my life," said the president of TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (who met in the fight for the presidential function), he said, "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to strengthen the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest personal surprise of your election?
TOP 09 has formally submitted its first draft laws, including the Paris Register of Treaties, which before the elections had been discussed by the photographic committees, but with the early elections it fell under the table.
The president of TOP 09 in the discussion for Aktuálná.cz argues that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, the TOP 09 clearly wants to prevent similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the ANO voter Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of the idea of introducing a register of contracts "defeats" the ANO motion program.
TOP 09 now used the tip - just asked for a proposal that had already been advanced to the second photo reading.
Hasic units have come to save lost dogs that hung 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous quarries in the rock
The cosmopolitan Ruby ran away after a small car accident.
Three days later, her prisoner in the tomb saw the man who had buried the dog.
The Hassites washed themselves through the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The wall was set free by fire units, which came to release it after somehow imprisoning itself on a dangerous landing in a 15 - foot - above - the - ground quarry.
Nine months later, Ruby escaped a small car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the rocky flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away when he got into a small accident, bitter after his lost dog, they searched for and put challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, a brisk-eyed dog caught up with the hanging Ruby on a cliff 15 meters above the ground.
Instead, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, using a transport bag for the animals to pick him up after the rock.
Andy Clayton, an expert leader of the technical rescue team, said that the dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was directly in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
At the time of his rescue, he swung his brow – he was totally frozen.
He's fine now.
Then he got the biscuits.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
The expert leader of the technical rescue team Peter Lau said: “Ruby had great happiness during his escape.”
There was a chance he'd be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a visit, and besides exhausting and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid when looking at the rescue action."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The Hasitches have done a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The Hasitches were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During an interview for the Australian broadcaster this week, this pop star said that for Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this year's veteran and he went after her.
And she said, “It was a long time ago, and now it is very nice to me.”
In a statement on Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the host singers (songwriters) who appeared this year at the Rolling Stones concert string.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Split Europe Gives Scotland a Choice
Next day, another horrible story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the EU's entry into Schengen would be a condition for independent Scotland's membership.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks in Berwick and the rest of the wire along Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspapers have mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as was expected, it has not been suggested in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they so wish.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the continuing dissatisfaction offer would be a cheap discount for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scottish people.
So it's a pretty bad story.
Besides, it's so old that it's been mined, and I've heard from the press that "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
However, one interesting idea is hidden in this vast story.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why exchange the London cougar for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great war plan to unite Europe has finally collapsed.
With the impact of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
In contrast to Europe, the parties are influenced by the EU-led resistance or the abolition of the euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if nowhere and had already taken advantage of almost five million votes in September's federal elections, basically from the Bundestag of Free Democracy (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On the home ground, there was always resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The competitiveness dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank together with a credible indicator of the national economy through the collapse of the common currency has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having a high budget deficit – it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production against Germany.
The only help is to cut down revenue and public expenditure – to which Germany offers.
The current problems with the budget and the currency have led to a deeper cause for European small-scale performance.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy supported by Brussels – code to support French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it does in the United States.
This is a paralysing expense disadvantage, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the freezing of wages in the world would not reverse the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with cheap peanut oil from the United States.
As a result of the ongoing rebellion, especially in France, the once-in-one EU footstep.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a tool that Germany will hold back and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as a sign of political legitimacy and has adopted its own economic policy in Europe and has left the French economy in need.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Penov, the anti-European National Front, just won the main additional elections and withdrew the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular in France with 24% votes – a timely warning for British Labourers that they cannot judge that the right-wing is automatically shown on the left.
How does Le Penová deal with its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European anti-monetary bloc across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do so well in these elections, which is likely to prevail, such a block can be dominated for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
I believe that the growing anti-European feeling and attitude towards the common currency will be linked at this time and the euro will be lost.
The EU is not going to disappear, but the transformation is more of a freer thing in the sense of "Europe (the sovereign nations)" already preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be areas (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it is also possible to inform Berlin and Brussels where we should be.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed organisation of Europe, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries would be simpler in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland – the most successful political movement in Europe – is an unparalleled economic measure that won a large majority in 2011 due to opposition to the scrotums planned (and implemented) by the Labour Office of Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now chose independence only to adopt the economic measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Adults
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their whites.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it
Experts claim that an epidemic of obesity may be one of the triggers of earlier puberty.
The trend of early puberty isn't so visible to boys.
Former reporter CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be scared when her daughter begins to grow breast-feeding in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, abstinence and support and body breath, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift of age when it comes to the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years against 12.75 years in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will last for at least two to three years before the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed what activates the real beginning of puberty, but if growth is accompanied by a growth spore before the 8th year old, the girl is considered to be “precisely mature”.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which children’s doctors can monitor closely.
Faster growth may be a reason for endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay the early menstrual period and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to halting growth and puberty in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
As far as implanting drugs is concerned, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he admits that “reducing puberty can alleviate problems with the behavior of the girl and her feelings that she is different from her peers”.
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry that they can get pregnant or how to manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have menstruation in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no related evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – get puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls between the ages of 6 and 9 who associate body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to achieve puberty before their white opponents.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, it appears that early puberty patterns are influenced by everything possible from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another assumption: Although in boys at a low age there is a swelling in the face and on the face, the trend towards the full bloom of premature puberty is not as obvious as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the Conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and oblivion is common even in the hips and buttocks.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebian Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to obtain instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean talking to the child before you assume," Kalowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that even though this happens early, this process is an ordinary part of life.
Nadia Konvalink in the role of economics.
Does he have a new job?
Sherečka Nadja Konvalinková (62) showed up for a break in the role of economics and it worked.
That a favorite Czech actress planned to change her profession and start a business in the house?
Nadia Konvalink showed up in James Joyce Irish pub and turned up a beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could live with a beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay at what I'm doing today, at the art," she said with a smile by Konvalink, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the Irish household.
"I like Irish beer and I'll give myself an Irish whiskey," she said to herself.
Nadi’s long-term friend and colleague Paul Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm after death, and I can't cheer up in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep that," the actor added.
Aeroplane manufacturers want the width of the seats, there are big bids in the bet
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute about the width of the seats in the second class for long-distance flights occurred, which resulted in a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-term flights for the economic class – not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose allocated space is the key to the claims for efficiency for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they should decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is deployed – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to it – is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the new mini-jumbo proposals.
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Large planes often attack each other on technical issues through commercial media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financials a picture showing three people stressed in the restaurant entitled "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats of narrower than in regional turbojets," Airbus John Leahy said.
As the feeding habits change, people are larger, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970 ’ s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long - distance air transport, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health, the weight of an average American from 40 to 49 years of age has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American has in the 21st century a 100 cm pass.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of 50-year-old seats when the average width of the seats of a newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims that it carried out a research that indicates that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing refuses and says that it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to carry out things that they are convinced they have to do to be successful," said an expert on Kent Craver's cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the traveller there is a major space for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect yields.
For this dispute, the competition in aircraft orders with estimated trade in the coming decades amounts to at least $700 billion in catalogue prices, enough to raise the tongue of American and European exports.
As stated in the July agency Reuters, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they reach 20 per cent better performance than the leading market representative in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on comparing the design of model 777X with 10 seats in line and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in line.
The profit in unit costs is reduced against the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to speed up more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive against our products," said Kevin Keniston, the leader of the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in order for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
"Fourty-five centimeters wide seat would be great for the traveler, but the reality is that from an entrepreneurial point of view, Airbus is a proposal motivated by a 777-model threat," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but they offer the airline a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Air traffic controllers even carry a measuring band with them to check competitive arrangements.
As long as I get comfortable, all manufacturers also offer high-speed aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
The recent Airbus highlighted the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering more seats in the streets in some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the challenge to new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but may detract from the sale wave of 777X.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded one thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing annually.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later they were 121 and in 2010 they were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"That the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," said an expert on the issue of AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague Light House for patients in the summer.
According to him, between January and September there were 165 HIV patients in the country, and this year they were 176.
From the beginning of the survey until the end of September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
There were 206 infected residents in the Central Czech Republic.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from South Moravian, 130 from Moravian or 116 from Ústecka.
The least infected from the Highland, they were 19.
A total of 88% of patients were sexually infected.
Fourteen people in the past have been infected with blood transfusions.
However, such a case did not occur in the Czech Republic in more than four centuries since the beginning of the test.
Six children were born with HIV, moved to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the film Gravity is, but it's beautiful, hard experts.
A fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold some time after the premiere in Czech cinema.
In October he was seen by the Union of film distributors of nearly 150 thousand spectators and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews will evaluate the images positively.
Others, however, find certain inequalities in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation doesn't even look like a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he'd be wrong.
I've enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice the hair of Sandy Bullock, who somehow doesn't feel comfortable.
Hubb's cosmic distance view and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different circular paths, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some movie viewers calculate an unrealistic effect and even the whole behavior of fire in a state of ease.
According to them, the Skafandrs would not have sustained such wounds either.
The heroes in the film Gravitation often get into conflict with various objects and clothes without any major difficulties.
Criticism has not even been saved.
So widespread a tragedy on the earth's circular path is, according to some discussionrs, unrealistic.
He's also surprised why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing about the "unreal" behavior of lan.
That sounds like it's destined for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide canvas, but clearly I can say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere to reality.
"More than what you mentioned inconsistencies touched me about how three times space stations with degraded levels of technology (the last Chinese) are shown."
"The rest of China will look better by the end of the decade than it is in the film."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of Science of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate physical laws, and so naturally oriented viewers estimate that in the event of various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of mobility, said by the dictionary of physics, is quite right, as well as the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and polar rays appearing in polar areas.
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in more detailed examinations.
For example, when I read comments, I also found that the preferred direction for the circulation of various space debris on the circular track appears in some scenes to be reversed rather than actually (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of Science of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators have adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly failure against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film and compared to other films of similar focus, it is evident that the creators have given themselves to the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that do not make sense it is worth calling it the fact that Hubble's space-wide view revolves around a different inclined orbit than ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalski (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not realize that the whole ISS would be rotating, so there is not even a clear source of force affecting Kowalskio, which forces both actors to let themselves go at a time when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new vaccine against nicotine may take pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from nicotine dependence.
Before testing on people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical Faculty in New York says the first signs are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a non-injurious virus, which has been prepared to carry genetic information for the creation of antinicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce the gas flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies track all the molecules of nicotine in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the chicken from getting nicotine.
In tests carried out by the immunized mouse which was added to nicotine, they continued their normal activity.
But mice that have not been vaccinated have "relieved", researchers have said, which is a sign that nicotine has entered their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because they turn liver cells into factory for the manufacture of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people were completely safe, they could be given to children before they would like to try a cigarette, and addiction to nicotine could be prevented.
However, it is much more likely that the smokers would use it to stop.
"They will know that once they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will have no benefit from it, and that will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
Tripod's denying that Obeid would influence her.
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for the Monitoring of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal rental at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its inquiry on Friday on whether Mr. Obeid was hiring several state ministers to rent him to Circular Quay, where he owned two restaurants and a café, without having to take part in the election procedure after his expulsion in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obei's hidden interests in these properties, based on the evidence presented on Thursday by the former deputy director of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pressed for renting in public competition.
The tenants were against it, and they also wanted longer contract terms.
In 2009, rentals for companies in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid's $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally the beneficiary of public competition.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, insisted on moving in government rental policy.
The review of the calls presented at ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dunn, the chief officer who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic of discussions during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whey, Mr. Tripodih.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, said the responsible man
The Israeli military aircraft hit a target at the Syrian port of Láziki on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible administrator of Fox News.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
The Associated Press press agency states that the aim was to launch the SA-125 Russian production.
At least twice a year ago, Israel launched an air raid on the delivery of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commenter Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was agreed that the President of Štech was upset.
Haytman Chovanec was a suspect to me just as soon as he was elected president, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the ČSSD disorder still.
The other gentlemen mainly presented their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has become the most disillusioned on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better chance than that the ČSSD proposed as vice-president of the Senate of Gijdöšk, the only one that would have no initial disability and I think it would lead to a standard performance.
It's such a good solution that there's hardly anyone in charge to support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdóšková could without fear make up the minority government with only a blessing from President Babi and without people, but with the human health minister Voorko, who is actually a credible social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would promulgate a proper referendum law and thus committed itself to supporting the President of the Ocamura.
President Babiš would finally make progress on tax, because he's smart and will see that it's not going to work without her.
People wouldn't have trouble, because Voorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the U.N., even here a minister of value would be, but if they do not want to join the risky government, but provide support, well, too.
Let's give the courage to only the Gaydosh!
Foreign staff with visa authorisation may undergo a "authority" test
As the government intends to extend police procedures, it considers the "justice" test for foreign workers with visa clearance 457.
If accepted, the test will be applied by means of criteria to prevent the application of programme 457 to fill unqualified jobs, or as the back door for family and friends moving to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers saying it could harm Australian neighbours.
“The “vote declaration of “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australia” are a very unpleasant remnant since the links required a protected labour market,” said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white labour force should be protected – and I would not see if anyone in this region noticed the announcement of this historic artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures that former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen has considered before.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Sri Lance, where he was working with officials for human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
Where the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is valid for a situation where the applicant is in a relationship or personal relationship with the holder or the relevant sponsor.’
After previous experiences with companies that planned to sponsor a small number of employees but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also need to justify the number of holders of visas 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who was trying to find asylum died with suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship this week on Christmas Island.
His nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia along with him, and after his father died on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on board.
Australian authorities and their husband rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Baroness Kramer said the project "connects the United Kingdom together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was working with the British government on this plan "inspired".
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the end of Phase two will lead the line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated costs of building a high-speed link between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the National Transport Offices of Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of any travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a connection – across Great Britain, HS2 will better connect 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is for Scotland's good news."
In support of the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael, called for "unique" support for Scottish membership in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland’s disproportionate economic benefits, but it also gives Scotland’s economic weight in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.”
We are therefore eager to cooperate with the British Government in examining the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government plans to do.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers next year and to joint decision-making on further steps.
Together with Barta, the anti-corruption police inspectorate and analysts arrested
Information about the arrest of Víta Bartya began to spread on Thursday night when the message was brought by the server Prvnizprazy.cz.
MF DINEs has found that the case has been taken care of by the General Safety Congregation Inspectorate (GIBS), her people should have arrested Barta in the centre of Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
However, the inspection addresses cases where there are accused police officers, its powers also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNS, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - leading analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek is also arrested.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
But Jaroslav Ibehej, a spokesperson for anti-corruption police, refused to comment on the fact that the media had to turn to the GIBS in this regard.
Even her spokesperson, Radka Sandor, did not want to say anything in the case, she turned to the City State Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this issue in the light of the protection of hidden realities," spokesperson Štěpánka Zenklová said.
Also from this incredulous reaction, it can be said that the event has taken place, but it is in a concealment regime that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer, Oldrich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
The media said that Bart's representing "and in this matter", but since it's about hidden information, Bart's arrest can't confirm or reverse.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be linked to a former police president, Peter Lessy.
This is what Barta and former President VV Radek John, who was in charge of the interior ministry, were doing.
The dispute that led to this heated between the expremirator Peter Necessary and the VV even had to solve the then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship with my person got.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of police.
Officially, the Council of John, the real leader of the party, was then Bart.
Barta was now running for the vote for the vote of Auguti, the MP just avoided him closely - with 175 votes.
Tomio Okamura's leader said he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
"Wivet Bart was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate and, as I have said over and over again before the elections, he was not even a member of the August direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave Bart the space to run for August, because he helped him solve the problem of the executors.
Vit Barta was at the courthouse in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárko.
The rules on the use of electronic equipment in an aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Travelers of Australian airlines will still have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during launch and landing, regardless of changes in the US, in order to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the U.S. company space to change its procedures, so passengers will be able on their devices to read electronic books, watch videos or play games during the critical phases of the flight if they remain in the "aircraft" regime.
Travelers can already do this during a major part of the flight, but many people are upset that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in a timely manner.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also stated that it has examined this notification but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft,’ he said.
This question is covered by the regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about expanding the use of her wireless broadband broadband system, has been subject to a change, but has announced that the decision of the regulatory authority will be taken.
"We would welcome if the CASA Authority carried out an analysis of the authorisation to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (without wire) it would improve customer experience," the speaker said.
Qantas announced that the current rules would be complied with for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it in a short time," he said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we are certainly studying carefully the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind them.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the regulations will be different from that of the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to report that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, handbags and passenger information programs.
"As soon as the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readings and smart phones, at any altitude of the sea," FAA said.
In rare cases, the crew shall order passengers to turn off during the landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment should be safely stored under the seat or in the storage area above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing gap in middle class, stop-rooms in Singapore are enjoying bloom
Janani Amirthalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings are stopped at Bendemeer's shopping center in Singapore so that she can pay for her daughter's schoolwork.
“We just bought a house with our husband and I gave it all my money,” says Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although each month as administrator gets $2,400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is, in fact, such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, has become the third stop on a ladder in Singapore this week.
The stopping of gambling is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthhalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Prisoners in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just over 15.4 per cent of the rate offered by the United Foreign Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, stoppers have the advantage that they do not require a person's verification (payment history) or a record of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that's why how families feel the pressure on the rising cost of living and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turning to hospitals.
After five years of possible growth from the global financial crisis and the financial loans supported by the free monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income turn to hospitals to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increasing use of credit in households mainly because of increasing rentals as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of an 80 per cent HDP, which is an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
Economics were also afraid of high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week was only due to technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"It is important that with rising costs people will try to supplement their income from medium to low [receiving scales] wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian CIMB bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people’s catching up on their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange for the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at 200 city stoppoints are made of gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded up to 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its stop shop in recent months.
Growth in the fixed sector is so large that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans not only to expand to neighbouring Malaysia – where he has four branches – but also to Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yea Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that it won on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discounted creditors felt under fire criticism for high interest rates, Mrs. Yea says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers stop the items already owning, and the cashing of personal property does not increase the debt of the household," he says.
In the company, the stockholding is increasingly adopted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, not only are people in the financial pressure among those who use lockers.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop the gold bars or Rolex watches, thus reaching up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all possible relationships.
“They belong to rich individuals who need to borrow in the short term for their courageous trades or investments, or to small businesses who need help with solving the problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
A rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for compromised health care in Tasmania contains strong conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste its financial resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Union is a "accelerated measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, the higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Thai MP Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and operations of the grey pit, will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available at free clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, better post-operative care, health care training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are reacting to the thoughts that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," Mrs Plibersek said.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict regime of proof and record obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian Union's money and inform each month of where additional funds have been spent.
A tripartite committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not go to nothing "until real reform is followed with a view to establishing a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system".
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first brought up in negotiations with the government president in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can relieve public health from a critical state," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
The federal health opposition Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is just "a trap".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has removed $430 million from our health system," ABC TV said.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian alliance, which spends $300 million, and it turns out it's a good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicoux adapted Denise Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film production and creation of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
They take place in the 1960s in France and tell a cloudy story about Suzanne, a young lady who is sent to a convent by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally outcast mother presented and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film will never match the craziness or sensationality, and that's his problem.
The rituals of this story lead viewers to experience the same pain as wearing a married shirt.
Ski resorts want to save families with children
Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, the supervisory authority says
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while rapid conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where toxic substances are supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notice of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came on 1 November,
the time limit set by this organisation with its seat in The Hague for the destruction or decommissioning of the operation of all equipment for the manufacture of chemical weapons and machinery for the mixing of chemicals with a view to the creation of poisonous gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction is, in principle, an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the Damashek must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including hypertrite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when the battles in Safira, which experts are talking about as headquarters of a chemical weaponry plant and warehouse, were fought Thursday, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Britain.
A group of activists, which through the Syrian network of activists monitored the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Asada, 18,678 control fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezballáh.
Among the killed are also 2,202 government conquerors and about 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that since March 2011 the conflict killed 100,000 people.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops fought in Sapphira against rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
On Thursday, the observatory stated that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The battles undermined the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission, have to deal with a tight deadline in the midst of the ongoing civil war in Syria.
A statement by the OPCW Office, which is working closely with the United Nations, said that its team is now “satisfied that it has verified – and monitored – the destruction of the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling”.
He added that "no other control activities are planned at the moment".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of verifications when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they weren't able to visit two places because of my security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW authorities stated that these two sites were "decommissioned and ... items of the chemical weapons programme which contained them were moved to two other declared sites that were checked".
It was not immediately clear whether the facilities in Safira were one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I look forward to the courage and strength you showed in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization had at the time," said Ahmet Uzumc's observer director, in his comment issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Asad's government are fighting against each other in civil war, especially with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawites, as opposed to Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the chief of the Observatory, Ramí Abdul Rahman, said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday inside the air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Láziki.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment of the founder of the Bali bomb attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bombing in Bali in 2002 responded to the verdict of the last of the founders who were put before justice and said that Umar Patek should have been corrected.
The duck, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for setting up an explosive device that was used in the bombing.
He could be released conditionally in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people remained dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other counts of terrorist-related charges, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on the St.
The complaint called for a lifetime, although it could take a man with the nickname "Demolition man" (boiler) to get the death penalty due to his reputation as an expert on the production of explosives.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be built in front of the repairer."
Every day, I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when a strong load was fired on 12 October 2002 shortly after the 23rd hour, located outside the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds ago a suicide bomber fired a baton filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he was three times "dead" to the doctors.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jama Islami responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlase and Imam Samudru – who were repaired four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and killing hundreds of others isn't so much anymore.
The duck was standing before the court as the last of Bali's assassins.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but finally in January 2011 he was killed in the Pakistani city of Abbottábad, where some four months later American forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Usam bin Ládin.
During his testimony, the FBI agent stated that the reports of the intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladine in an attempt to re-establish the link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not give up voluntarily," Mrs Corteen said.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for the sorrow he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will be part of the ceremony in Bali and Australia.
"This year we'll see a lot of tears," said Corteen.
The patent can still be appealed against.
FAA: Travelers in air transport can now use technological gains in aircraft (but cannot call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices "from door to door" – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – for reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers, however, do not expect the changes to occur immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, FAA Manager Michael Huert said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to report to the FAA administration to the extent that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the storage directives in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA has indicated that some airlines have already received plans to extend the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They cannot be switched on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometres and the captain does not issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane drops to land and does not turn them off until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic disruption may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and departure, FAA has stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adjusted to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are safely introduced – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in his statement.
It is, frankly, tiring us to look like "guardians."
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and SMS or downloading data will still be prohibited below 3 kilometres of sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be informed that their smart phones, tablets and other devices will be switched to the air conditioner.
So still no Words with friends, online game type scrapble that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when it was, as is well known, thrown out of the plane of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the door.
And more heavy equipment like notebooks will still have to be stored because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Phone calls will still be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not determine the FAA, but the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may cancel a ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, National Transport Safety Expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference of the broadcast towers in the air," Rosenker said.
The sectional advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to investigate this problem proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressures have been put on the FAA to mitigate the restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no valid security reason for this ban.
Limitations are also becoming increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is everywhere.
Some studies indicate that up to one third of passengers forget about or ignore the obligation to turn off their equipment.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio, technical output at that time.
New airlines are much more dedicated to electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic disruption.
For a few years now, airlines have been offering travellers the use of Wi-Fi in sea-going heights.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted under the new rules for greater use of electronic devices, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting than they did in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimum broadcasts when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who press to free themselves from restrictions on the use of these devices are Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readings of Kindle and conducted pilot flights, but no problem occurred.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities present any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Operators said he was convinced that the disruption of these facilities was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only critical reports from pilots who should support the fact that such devices can cause aircraft systems to collapse, and most of these reports are very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that FAA should allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the aircraft during low visibility flight.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which technology uses to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognised that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from the garden of the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the shore after being found exhausted on the oil shelf in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One baptized last month was transferred by helicopter to Aberdeen after being previously treated by the Scottish SPCA in the rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This infant was probably migrating from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
According to him, there were forces and he found a shelter on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted by a request for help.”
At the time he was baptized, he was in good health and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to connect businesses and define what changes the UK entrepreneurs and jobs-creating companies want to see with the EU.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex research in which we have asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading companies representing UK companies of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be for many surprises.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU states are slowing down.
They want to see how the government is prioritising new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than hampering the long and urgent process of reforming the European secret institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – even 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
Finally, our survey of the leading companies revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that the clear majority wants Britain to make efforts to change the treaty and to establish a relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not on politics.
The finding that companies of different sizes and major business groups have been identified suggests that the business sector is pushing for a "significant change" that will bring back the influence on Britain.
The stake is a lot – achieving a change in the contract and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% when voting in a referendum for suspension in the EU.
The president of the government should not be concerned: this survey shows that British trade supports its plan to update the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards Britain.
The better agreement for Britain is possible, and given the fact that the eurozone is on its way to closer economic and fiscal union, even more so.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means refocusing on trade and fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach to business.
John Kerry admitted: Spying went too far!
The United States has been spying on "too far", according to AFP, the head of American diplomacy John Kerry during the video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
According to the AFP, "the first recognition from Washington" was reported in the midst of a rapid controversy on both coasts of the Atlantic over the scandalous disclosure of the total monitoring of the data of the American National Security Agency (NSA), which has also become the target of the US allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as President Barack Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the discussion, however, he was primarily defending past practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings exploded, and people were killed because we were able to be informed in time about the plots," Kerry stressed.
However, he once again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around the U.S. survey, which allegedly followed the number of phone calls, broke up in Europe this month.
Among other things, it was shown that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angely Merkel.
European leaders did not hide frustrations, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach agreements that would command or significantly restrict monitoring with the United States.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the tube in Bulgaria begins a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"Today we witness the border: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," President Gazprom Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the building has to start in other countries in the direction of the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for annual capacity of 2.2 billion Earth gas recirculators.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
He's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement Hizballáh deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle of the upper region of Kalamún.
According to the ongoing Israeli reports, in the middle raids on two sites in western Syria, he destroyed rockets designed precisely for Hizballáhu.
This Lebanese Shirt Organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army.
Its programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that preventing the movement of weapons into the hands of Hizballáh to Lebanon.
Reports of the Central Israeli raids on weapons stockpiles in western Syria are only being clarified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but he was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The Al-Arabi reporting station claims that two stocks have been hit, where rockets have been prepared to transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was Russian SA-8 production rockets.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballáh with rockets and Syrian flight teaches members of the armed section of Hizballáh to deal with rockets.
SA-8 are obsolete rockets that have had an army since the 1980s.
They're placed on a moving carriage.
Although they are relatively primitive, with mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the fire, so it's hard to focus.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by the ruling alavitas.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hizballáh has been involved in battles in western Syria in the past.
They claim that it helps to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now, apparently, 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hizballáh, he also strengthens his troops in the Syrian army.
Salamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is to be held by al-Arabi sources in response to the recent attack by the Syrian Shiite Brigadier Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballáh helped the Syrian army fight back this year at the Lebanese border.
Many rebels from Kusair have just gone to Kalamún.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
For reasons, corruption, money laundering and state orders, tax increases and government scandals have been reported.
According to the election results, most citizens were eligible for this status.
They were actually satisfied with the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I will not explain that 3,413,497 volts did not come to the elections, 596,357 volts elected TOP 09 384 174 volts elected ODS in total, thus 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all eligible volts.
Which is a half-mostly.
If the above parties add 1,016 829 ČSSD volts, then the old order (because all of these parties were involved in the "throwing" and debt of this state), then they actually agreed to 64.23% of the eligible volts.
In fact, the majority of the voters have stated that they are not to punish the perpetrators of this state’s theft and misappropriation.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who share the rule of law are?
Is there any help at all?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were accused of complaints against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales had complained about sexual abuse of children before a charge was brought against the child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the Commission it was announced that in its opening statement to the Commission this association stated that the case of sexual abuse of the child had never been resolved in its organisation.
The Executive Director, Phillip Hare, was asked where one of the employees of the YMCA association was charged with child pornography offences, and the other when a gymnast in Caringbah from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 of the sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Fourness, the board's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it was stated that the YMCA organisation carried out external audits that assessed this organisation as the leading child rights representative.
Evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that YMCA has been informed that the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year received the second lowest of four possible evaluations.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the management of him himself failed down when Mr. Lorda accepted without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of children's safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys who were allowed to work in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that protected staff from reporting children's safety violations by Mr. Lord.
Members of the staff gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with the children on their own, particularly watching them, letting them sit down at the clinic, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for the training of children's safety because she was concerned about his behavior, found that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the children's services in the YMCA Association in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about”.
The Director-General said that he did not accept evidence from staff that he did not know if they should contact their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had obscured their judgment, and that is why they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that to the Council of the YMCA Association in New South Wales, he announced his opinion that the teaching of "the case of Jonathan Lord" for the organisation was based on the fact that the staff "did not report", and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign silence agreements shortly after the indictment was discovered made by the general manager for child services in the YMCA organization Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid interference with evidence, but it was "overwhelmed" and wrongly carried out.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University said that YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the set, checking, processing, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take a chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a night discussion on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-old policy-makers expressed their views on the various areas of home policy.
Since June 2007, after his ten-year resignation in the leadership position, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an envoy of the Biscay Peace Quartet.
When asked whether he would return to the position of minister president, his answer to the London Evening Standard was: “Yes, of course, but it is probably difficult to do so, so...”
While expert representatives gathered in Cardiff to play horses to fight for the price of the Year's Horse, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fonton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only a few months ago he did the first steps, this boy and his pet pet, the Shetland ponique Toffee, were smoothed down three rounds to finally win the main prize and left behind 30 tugs with adult rivals.
These inseparable twins – with the same height – were approved for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition by the Sunnybank driving centre in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the ladies and ladies in elegant blankets, put his bartender into a happy corner and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around.
Fenton was honored by the jury for its natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for appearance and personality.
Fenton Toffee was born in March at his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee work together very well."
They didn't make great hopes, but they finally left with a golden cup and a box.
It was just the second time he and Toffe competed, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him to be a phenomenal and completely foreign people wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales walks in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who plays horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited.”
He ran across the sand all along the arena, and although he acted so small, he had a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and gets two chickens in care.
Because of how he started, he's going to be back at the horse competition of the year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker of the annual horse competition said: "Fentons are only three, but already knows how to control the pony."
It's a great team together.
The jury raised Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed in the competition circle.
They're always watching how good the team work is between the pony and who runs it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the egg.
I'm sure Fenton also helped with some nice clothes, really got in there with him.
Too many interesting papers are to be examined
The Chinese newspapers, which on the title page requested the release of the defendant from the case, will be carefully investigated, the press manager said.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public application for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen, however, later on on TV admitted that he had paid to invent stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express paper will now carry out "full repair".
The regulation came from the State Administration for Printing and Publication, Announcement, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 the New Express from the Yangcheng Evening News group issued a number of false reports on Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express news was irregular," the manager said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose on Chen Yongzhou an administrative penalty in the form of a cancellation of a newspaper licence".
Furthermore, he "ordered the Yakcheng Group of Evening News to implement a general correction of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express concerning financial imbalances in the company with the construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his papers were issued on the front page of two requests for his release and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had given false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV state news station.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
After apologizing to Mr. Chen, he issued the New Express letter on the cover page of the apology, in which he stated that he had failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his report.
Recently, several closely monitored suspects were admitted on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico was found with its own railways
One of the most industrial tunnels for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico has been found, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel's dimensions of about one meter once as one of the most industrial secrets they've ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is clicked to the length of nearly six football games, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of unspecified warehouses, where you can easily hide cargo cars before loading drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel had been closed before the drug could be safely transported in it.
Along with the discovery of a tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were complained about the possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of conviction, the sentence shall be suspended from 10 years to after-life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, pedestrians penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walking distance of about 650 metres equipped with trains that took them from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and Centre propose management.
For example, they offer joint advertising
The new integrated newsroom of Economy in Prague.
Economy has taken another step to transform the Centre holding into its media home.
Since Friday, Economy and Centre have shared top management.
"The association of organisational structures and the staff of the Union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media home," comments Deputy Chairman of the Economy and Commissioner General Kamil Kermak.
Kermaka, who will be in charge of joint management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demoth.
The new joint director of the trade was appointed Pavel Voparíl, who is also headed by the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tilcher.
Stépán Burd became the new head of information technology.
The joint editor is Vladimir Piskáček, whose team is also the director of the Jakub Unger transformation.
Adéla Pitts was assigned to the newly appointed marketing director.
A single corporate communications service is new to the faith of Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, enable us to come into the market with a common range of advertising products, to better combine the content of all the titles issued, and, last but not least, to significantly improve the business management of the company," Kermák added.
Zdeněk Bakala's own financial partner, Economy, concluded a contract on the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings creates servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of more than two dozen smaller websites.
The company Economy is the publisher of the Economic News, the IHNED.cz news server, the Respect and Economy weeklys and the number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Czech publishers have long been the most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This year, the publishers moved to the newly built modern space in Prague.
CME will focus on television business.
He'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to bribe a thousand people.
Cutting all the side activities and focusing only on its main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
So almost a quarter of people are lost.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV music station.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the foreign TV unit TV Nova, so far it is not clear.
"It's premature and we really can't comment on it," said the Communications Director of Nova Josef Kukolíček.
According to MF DNS information, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personal situation of the CME branch in Romania and other countries.
Both the new heads of News Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after long-term director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during the mid-term conference talk with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly limit the cost of production of its own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a high-capacity tank was burned, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"The fire had already gone out on Thursday, 11 o'clock before the fire, and this morning fire was still on fire," said Prague fireman Paulina Adamc.
The amount of air damage in the surrounding area, as measured, did not exceed the permitted limit.
The amount of damage and causes of fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firemen have gradually arrived in the area of Kolben Street.
"It's the fire of a high-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There's no functional hydrant network in the area, so we're going to throw away using the tanker's transportation," she added.
According to the server, tn.cz complicated the hatching of the malfunctioning network of hydrants, which is why firemen had to transport the water.
The firefighter announced the second stage of firefighting.
There are four steps in total, the fourth in most serious situations is declared.
The chemicals also went to check the peace of dangerous substances that could get into the air at the fire.
"But they did not measure in the air quantities of pollutants that would exceed the hygiene standards," firefighters said.
British police issued a release notice to Assange
The British police reported today on the release of founder WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard reported that he had delivered a 40-year-old Australian "release notice" asking him to go to the police station and that if he didn't do so, he might be in danger of arrest.
Under the British law, Assange exhausted his opportunity when the Supreme Court cancelled his appeal this month against extradition, and so faced extradition to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would release him to the United States, on June 19th, he searched for refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in this South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered a notice of release to a 40-year-old man asking to be delivered to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," said the speaker.
Assange still violates the conditions of bail.
The Ambassador refused to comment on the notification.
Assange is afraid that he will be issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face espionage charges because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks' website.
The driver received a fine of 1,000 pounds for driving more than 200 km/h with a hot drink between his feet

Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was seen on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a bottle of potion between his thighs.
At Colchester Howie's police court, he confessed to driving recklessly and recklessly.
Its accounts have reached seven points, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and an invoice for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has pre-counted the tax on the proceeds of the financial assets, but is waiting for Mr Osborn's final decision, which in the 2012 budget presented a 7% transfer fee for buildings at a price of more than 2 million pounds and annual charges for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the real estate transfer fee in the periods Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which in the fiscal year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northwest, North West and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “Because of the increase in the transfer of property in high-value households and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high value is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete tax system on the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to tend to buy real estate in London, if the existing owners were reluctant to sell”.
The leading properties – top 5% to 10% of the housing market at the price – in the rich band from Fulham to Wimbledon recorded a record increase of 11.8% last year.
The prices on Wednesday of London continue to show a steady growth of 5,6 % year-on-year, but have been obscured by the flourishing "home market", where, according to a survey by the real estate office of Savills, the southwest (7,4 %) and the east (6,5 %) of the increase.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movement of the tail is related to the dog’s load
Previous studies have shown that a happy dog spins more on the right side (from the dog’s perspective), while a nervous dog tends to have on the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and react to these mild differences in the movement of time.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in people that the left and right side of the brain have a different connection to impulses that provoke positive or negative emotions."
We've been trying to do the same thing for other species.
He added that as with people, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-wing movements and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate rotation of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the tape frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their eyes go on one side and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have proposed to dogs films about dogs – whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette – in order to get rid of any fussy impulses, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the time and show it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw a dog moving in the direction of the right (from the perspective of the rotating dog), they remained perfectly calm.
However, when she noticed the filming of the ox to the left (again from the perspective of the dog rotating the ox), their tape frequency increased and the animals did not really act.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that the dogs learned from experience what movements they must and must not take care of.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly behaviour and the movement of transport results in less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and practitioners better understand the emotions of their animals.
A dog behavior specialist John Bradshaw, a university zoologist at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side of the dogs were important.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their head left when watching an aggressive dog, and right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another expert agreement from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dogs were most likely to be listed with a dog with a robot when they were turning the way left rather than the way they were becoming non-real – exactly the opposite of the Italian study. ”
According to him, the difference may be that dogs in these various animal studies in movies or dogs do not fully express themselves as dogs.
He explained that he could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although there is fallen evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes in many cases, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it will probably not take long before we understand why their eyes sometimes go on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow for Alexe Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow after he was diagnosed with the main singer to turn on the ring.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform on Friday at the city complex Hydro.
The illness of the lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone the fourth performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys Group must also postpone the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.”
“Alexi Turner was diagnosed with the inflammation of the throat, and unfortunately he will not be able to perform.”
The performance in the LG arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances shall remain in force.
We'd like to apologize to all those who bought their tickets for the inconveniences that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact customer services at the warehouse where you bought your tickets.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis appointed for the first time the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are the ones who choose the pope, so František will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, the election of the pope is no longer possible – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, who spoke to the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, there would be a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistorium.
"The Pope František decided to announce his decision to invite the February Consistorium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices list said the number of electorate cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The Consistorium will be significant next year because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, there are some orientations for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to observe whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only an inexhaustible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František set up the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which has given the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"The Frenchman chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it's "quite possible," that these cardinals would ask for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's just news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally increased the position of cardinals of the bishops from large places, but František is "full of surprise – so we don't know who he is".
GM is downloading some new light-duty cars in the USA for repairing seat belts
According to a Friday notice from the US Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of its new (2014) light-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra cars to repair the problem with manual mounting.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism may be to mount the front seat of the dispute.
As a result, seat restraints are not in accordance with the federal car safety standards for head restraints.
The notice on the State Transport Safety Management (NHTSA) website says that “if the rear vehicle gets hit, the head restraint does not have to properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury”.
Downloaded models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM introduced a supply on the market in June, and for this leading American car, it is the most important vehicle to be placed on the market since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the suppliers of the dispute in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notifications to the owners of the 16-day failure of the government, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, rose by around 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, announced GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
The shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.

It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a memory of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patient judgements tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows took your breath.
The elections ended with a tremendous overhaul and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My associates cried out for joy, and my parents hid the papers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During his visit to the office in 2008, Obama had 82% of the support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the present is a hard awakening, like talking out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I put in my first ballot, there's really been a change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognise that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on available care through the withdrawal of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask anything, not to say anything” after Usama bin Ladina died.
In addition, I am convinced that the side barriers have returned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the possibility for the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantaná.
But after many situations when I defended Obama's administration in front of my colleagues and friends, I have grown to an absolute limit when it comes to explanations that they can provide.
I felt political hopelessness instead.
Obstacles to Republicans cannot explain the consent of foreign leaders nor of unmanned aircraft killing innocent children at sea.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor does it follow those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for repairing Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper court or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more aggressive ... than Nixon's administration".
And the latest cannot even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the availability of a simple website.
I don't know if something like that could have been expected.
Should I have known in 18 years that the government might be opposed to the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will create an opposition political party and random events, such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be largely the result of the administrative decision.
And that hurts the most.
I elected both of them again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unexploded alternative and seemed unable to confirm his policy or position.
I felt that the second period of operation for Obama, released from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes that we had ever heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama's support this week falling below 45% – is making this book even more difficult.
It makes me think of the series of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read in the book chapter about how Obama suffered a massive defeat with Clinton at the Pennsylvania headquarters.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he must get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We can't forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that the president of the government of Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over the parental leave program
The billionaire and MP, Clive Palmer, say that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is in conflict of interest about the parental leave program, because his daughters can get tired and tired of it.
The banana magnet, which runs a dispute over the return of a 6 million-dollar carbon tax measure, made this claim when he tried to blend the table with the question whether it was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate, which play a key role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that in a conflict of interests there could only be ministers, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position to have personal benefits from the policy.
“He got into a great conflict of interest as regards paid parental leave, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, she would have a direct interest in getting parental leave,” said Palmer.
Two months after the elections of the electoral committee, Mr. Palmer officially declared the winner of the fairfax section of the Sunshine Coast for the benefit of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Frances' daughter to Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, run details into the computer, vote immediately and have results at midnight?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of ballot papers.
Is it that the results can be guessed if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently made a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the airport in the area of Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new work "very seriously".
Public administration is a public service.
"We are not trying for any reward except that we can serve companies at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that they wash your hands with change and mood.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unresolved role.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that had washed her hands after she was ill acted with a much more optimistic view than those who had not washed her hands.
Also, the "washed-handed" group conducted better in another test than the other one.
However, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who were not washed.
The results of the "wet" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the tests indicate to psychologists that physical cleanliness really eliminates negative feelings of failure.
At the same time, the motivations are reduced, the tests have to focus a lot more on other tests.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic when we get back from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs don't have hands, but it's five.
Most of them also go to the hospital after work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of the people wash their hands.
The exposure of the pet motivates 78.7 per cent of people to wash their hands.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash hands after handing to a stranger.
In this situation, the hands wash 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I fear that the reality is different and people are trying to get a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two persons notified of the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, another sign that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspicious machines with the currency market is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed their cooperation with the competent authorities in the investigation of the world’s largest financial market, where each day it changes the owners of 5.3 billion USD.
The two traders mentioned above would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the framework of an expanding investigation, which would respond to the LIBOR manipulation rate scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless investigation in this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event reported that RBS transferred the e-mail and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader to the UK Financial Management Authority.
This businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as European President of foreign exchange trading with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash trading president in Cita, took a leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former Monetary Manager in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any offense.
The bankers from Barclays and Citigroup were part of Mr. Usher's group to send quick news, and the people said they were dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS stated that after the Swiss supervisory authority informed Finma that it was investigating suspicious machines on the market with foreign currency in several Swiss banks, it took action against some of its employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claims that these bankers have joined in order to move with the monetary market.
In addition, the people informed the situation that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had submitted an internal investigation or had received a request from the competent authorities for information.
The banks are discussing the years with old quick news and e-mails to find cases of crimes.
The investigation reports scared traders in the area, which was one of the biggest engines for producing profit in the investment banks’ closures in recent years, but which was disrupted by the fact that a small lack of currency has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that with a large and high liquidity market with foreign currency it is basically impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say it doesn't necessarily have to be true.
The highly established trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity exploration between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platform means that ‘you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices’.
The report came that same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had missed her department for trading with the shares of a trader who lost almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has acted alone and that this problem has been solved," Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of this year’s third quarter, the tests confirmed a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for the AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to it, 2,063 were infected throughout the PRC so far.
In 396 the immune failure disease has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing every year.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
The 2009 investigation revealed 156 new infections and then 180 in 2010.
Before, the number fell to 153 last year, but it was still a record.
According to the lab there were 212.
"That the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I believe there is no doubt," says the expert on AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague Light House for patients in the summer.
From October to the end of the year 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year at 47, Hlavatý said.
In September 21 new patients and three patients were reported by physicians.
From the start of surveillance to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to the graveyard.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedecree would reveal.
Many people are "counting from graves."
They slowly push the graves and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out what nationalities they live here, what faiths they are, how large and coherent families they belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And he will come out of the graves and find out how they care for the dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the constitution, which is a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
By vote 5:4 the Court ruled that the individual regulation of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens them to pay the fine – does not support the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remainder of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, would otherwise threaten the loss of all funding of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not compulsori and contrary to the Constitution.
26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed a complaint for the purpose of blocking this Act.
During the spring of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
By the words "Mugabe is a bullet-ass" no longer threatens the prison, the court has abolished the law
Until now the Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk about the 80s of Mugabe, which has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, then stands before it since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, for disregarding the Presidential Authority, a fine of $100 to one year of deprivation of liberty was threatened.
"State representatives should not be bitterly accused of people who are commenting on the president's premises or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges agreed unanimously that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government is withdrawing from the court’s decision, the British BBC informed.
Against the law, a number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, were publicly defined, who were arrested by police two years ago by the president's alleged opposition to a bar fight with a police officer.
In May, opposition activist Mugabe's public campaigner, a "big-ass" job, ended up in prison.
In August, the prosecutor accused a 16-year-old man of his intention to use Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared an anti-constitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose declaration will later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalisation of someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to freedom of expression," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil freedoms was adopted in March in Zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum.
A few steps from the dictatorship of one man came to the country in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to the Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangiraj.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and to the highest inflation rate in the world by 2008 that exceeded 100,000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other states are payable in Zimbabwe.
The remaining economy is at the heart of Mugabe's irreverent agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redeployed the land of white farmers between his benefactors and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the walkway.
Central banks will keep swap lines fixed
The Interim and Bilateral Agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Federation, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
The banks put it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," said Julian Callow, chief international economist of the London Bank of Barclays.
"All the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not my surprise," adds Vojtich Band, the main economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bond that began to arise in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its programme of support for the American economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency while currently remaining liquidity of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB shall launch a third attempt to restore confidence in the European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no)states personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish here because there was someone sitting on the sidewalk who shouldn't have finished the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to drive to another branch, the registration went down, then I moved, and that changed my address and the number of the civil certificate.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it wasn't possible because I had another OP number, an address and that it just wasn't possible to finish it and that I had to ask for data deletion and re-registration.
I did so, and I wrote on 24.10.2013 on technical support that I was requesting the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
I was told by technical support that I should complete my registration on the sidewalk.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where after the 4th emergency, 25.10. they wrote that personal data had been deleted at my request.
So one would say that he could do that new registration, and here the problems started again first, it was written to me that my username was already covered (I don't understand it - it's not personal data, but finally it was deleted too).
So I used another user name and I jumped out on me that my personal data is already stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they have stored something that claims they deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
On my question how it was possible they told me that personal data were actually deleted 25.10. and that I would send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (about 15 a.m. yesterday) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in touch with technical support for a week, and I've decided it's still not working.
And what if the truth is what it claims (if it isn't), no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the intended e-mail and phone number and the world is amazed, I found out that I had been sent a link to the e-mail to complete registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't figure out what they said.
So I gave this back technical support that they're just lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they're writing) because what they're writing is not true.
I've reported several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport has written me a bad sentence - I'm sorry, but by having you registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication's over.
Respect repeats the same sentence that the registration is valid for the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration has not been completed by clicking on that link in email and has not actually passed.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only didn't erase the data he claimed, but he's still lying when he claims it again.
Worse, it's easier to prove how they lie and try to make it look like a customer's fault.
By the way, after mentioning this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and e-mail came from Technical Support that the matter was being checked and informed (after a week of emergency and guessing and alerting to the same error).
In the meter on the Bridge plays music
Transport company hl.m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in metro.
The first vestibule, where reproducible instrumental music is continuously played during the operation of the meter, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Horáček has brought not only his completely new twoCD Czech calendar to the hall of the Colin City Social House, but especially among us singers Lenka Novo, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Matej Bank.
After the intruder and the actress's study of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how they played last in Kolina and in the theatre and the entire town turned out to be an electric current.
"Otherwise, two types of karate were produced in Cologne, with which I came into contact with a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded the cousin of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could take a tour of the Zakolanes or Dúbravce at Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical taste.
The calendar also made Joseph Mánes, who gave it on his watch, about ice hockey, but once again he didn't know how to meet in those squares and scan who didn't jump, there's no Czech.
That's also the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
But Ondra Ruml sang out of this board for him a very good night's sleep, singing at night, and accompanied him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists joined in singing a little reverberating To the side of the heart, which immediately spread the scene.
"I'm glad you were interested in that song, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," Michal Horáček responded.
After remembering Peter Hapk, I was introduced to Františk Segrada, originally by Richard Müller, who was rewarded with a huge applause, Hanu Heger reminded again of the composition Dad liked Lid Baar and with Horace's explanation of the Communist ban and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába recalled the composition of Sebastian, then Segradio sang the beautiful composition of Prague by Jarda Svoboda, the mother of mourning and the former Colinák.
But it was already the conclusion, the applause in the stand and the addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was prepared for the playlist, but the fans didn't dance anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even a package from the legendary LP and photographed with any interested parties.
Berdycha with Stěpánka will complement Rosol and Hajek
At the final of the Davis cup against Serbia, the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav returned four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukaš Rosol, Jan Hajek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to the field of the opponent to the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The finals are the third Czech in the last five years.
"We know that we're going on hot ground, that it'll be wild, and we've always got to focus on our performance."
"Let's go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it the best," said Štěpánek, the winner of the final last year with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelites presented exactly what the bombing of Syria would look like.
Without unnecessary loss, threats and millions of declarations, they sent planes, they hit the target, and they came back.
Without getting involved in the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm all the actions and no longer express themselves.
On the contrary, the exact confusion and gross, acts of unsupported Obama's Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media be fooled by their claims that it was bombed "Syrian Baseline" or "deliveries for Hizbaláh".
Recently, I wrote about the fact that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on rhetorical level, Russia is happy to continue to supply the weapons of Syria.
And just the fresh supply of Russian missiles exposed in the port of Latakia became the target of Israel's invasion.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed the Asad regime, not the rebels, although it should be according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of space units, probably Delta Force.
It has not been known until now that they were marked during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the heroic death of two former SEALs personnel who were protecting the CIA area in the city was, in my opinion, members of the CIA's secret team, which was made up of former soldiers.
It took a long time to speculate what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
In any event, it is rather surprising that the CIA has its office in Libya protected by towering nests (right on one such one of the two SEALs died after the mine attack).
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were members of the U.S. team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi they volunteered for the attack and, together with five private contractors, launched their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
Obama's administration is blaspheming the fact that during that attack, that command was not officially and completely installed and that it just hesitated what to do.
Commander of the team, so without orders, these volunteers are likely to be released.
However, the fact that the country is acting not on a one-time basis, but on a permanent basis, American teams, CIA agents and private contractors are all interesting information.
And because until recently nothing has been officially acknowledged and even now it is just some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States, even if half of it's trying to torture terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would be much more helpful to resolve the state situation.
The last place in the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media was almost talking about Iranian air forces for charging U.S. drones.
However, little is known about how American drones effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if he happens to be able to reveal his drone in the airspace, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was tracking an American drone in the international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp landing of the American Super Downloader F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew out of Phantom to see his weapon visually without Phantom recording it on the radar or just notice it, and then when he suddenly appeared at him and called out an Iranian pilot to return home, he didn't repeat.
It's not surprising that Phantom is a plane of American production that remembers Vietnam's war.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzen is still able to win, he promises.
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, the defender or depositary of Viktorie Plzeň František Wijtoral has a form that has brought him back to representation for a year.
He's also got gunshots, he's got activity, he's been hit in Teplí's fight.
Victoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplí after victory, but finally she took one point out of these two duels.
František Wijtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the Jablonc fight.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat the Jablonec at home," promises František Wijtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a hard fight with the Northerners, who play aggressive football.
It's all about fighting Jablonc, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe this will be a great match on Friday evening," the Czech fan representative at the Doosan Arena.
The last fights didn't come up as she wished, but the word of the crisis of the defender Victoria refuses.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we'll win on Friday and it'll be good again," said Western Defender.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of fans.
"He's playing Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our great fans."
"I believe we'll win them back," said the Reuters.
Jana Petzová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really about a step, it's about a big leap - a leap back a few years, in memory, into my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, get out and do your homework.
Even though these "obligations," it was mostly just a theory, a desire for parents.
The practice was completely different - get out of school, throw a bag into the corner and run outside.
Playing ball games with other kids, jumping pancakes.
Then at Helen's show and her boys blow up the birthday party for their grandmother with a rare sepsis.
And then, after a few warnings, finally wash it up, roll it up, put the wood into brick stones in the winter and do the tasks of doing it until after the harvest under the lamp (or rely on the partner and instead of the tasks of writing a beloved verse addressed to the school love).
In the morning to have a homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the contents of which were neither left) and to drink it with the tea from the dried herbs that Mom and I so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room when our sister recorded songs from the radio to the tapes that sounded in the old cassette after Mom.
And then we flipped the tapes on the counter and we kept playing one of the same songs, our favorite, and they got a syphony.
Or we phoned through the table using the backpacks that were connected to each other - and when we were already on the phone to hear better, it was necessary to clean your ears carefully, then the host was a sirka + wat.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPad ba even mobiles and notebooks or brand clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "sport" in the dress was batiked a piece of home production using SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with the mentioned mother's cassette and, at the most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we also used only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, not angry, or as I've already said, "just" out.
By the time I was a little older, we had a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents had been looking for him for a long time, but unfortunately he wasn't warmed up for a long time.
My younger sister used to rub a stork in it, because it was so beautiful to have the tapes, she tried to see if the stork went down and the stork.
Unfortunately he fell asleep, but it was his last set.
Well, and he's got this adventure to date, poor guy, on a plate from his dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she broke into the video and thought she was playing the recipe and didn't miss it, so she can't burn it to date.
I remember how we were able to communicate with each other, agree without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with our sister, we had an appointment with the grandmother's granddaughter when we met again next year in the summer with the grandmother - and so it was, so it paid.
We're together.
Promise me you'll see someone in a year?
I also remember winter when we ran out with the entire village, built snowflakes, rode on a snowy hill at a church on a sledger.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the last day.
Of course, we heard the sister before every evening the notoriously well-known sentence, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, it is today, but you certainly don't have in the bathroom attached to the cotton soap in the lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" at a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with Mom on the floor, washed his feet with bricks, opened the door and looked at the fireplace and listened to the cracking of the wood that came out of the stone.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we have on the social network, we knew how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write daily messages through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where the black corners of the black-and-white photos are marked.
And if I didn't happen to know how many photos I had back then, it's always a year of shooting.
I can see that even though our sisters didn't listen much to us, and we also had my cousin's pants for two bigger numbers, no one ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back on that step forward - into reality.
By 2013 and I will wait for what modern times will come up once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now for a young teenage generation, at least "hundred years after monkeys" and I think that many come from not experiencing this "precipitous" time either.
I'd like them to!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies complained about Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the missing Nortel company, filed a complaint Thursday for infringement of the patent against mobile telephone producers including Google, a company which has been procuring in the course of a bankruptcy of Nortel company.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel's patents of USD 4.5 billion, appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court in Texas, Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for infringement of the patent.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaching seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to connect search terms on the Internet to the relevant advertising, states the complaint, which is the core of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on Google Android's operating system, which is highly competitive for mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million price offer for patents by Nortel.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent fight, Google won $12.5 billion in Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by the Motorola patent group.
"The consequences of the failure to obtain the patent in the bid that is the subject of the dispute, Google patents have broken and continues to break," the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google, because it considers that it is contrary to Google's patent intention, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cepkova: November smile
She came out of four degrees Celsia, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she gave up a smile, the one who always gave up as a defense against the pleasure of a friendly environment.
That made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to lay down on the public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother, and she was surrounded by grandchildren Elinka or Adík.
And of course, when her sons called.
You remember very well the lesson from the endless course of business skills.
Now they're really good at it.
Not to disturb her closest.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like wearing a mask.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her really laugh, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt to the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day was only a difficult day to end political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised "new Egypt", when he was celebrated as the first freely elected president of the country, after Husni Mubarak, who was sat down 16 months earlier.
When he was brought before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a settlement built with a view to the Nile, which resembles the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and the second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been an illegal organization for over 84 years since its birth as a target for intense attacks by individual governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small car colony shortly after 11 a.m., they guarded the building of hundreds of soldiers and policemen.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the building court to celebrate the president, and unlike the Presidential event Mubarak's period of transport was stopped only briefly so that the column of the project could normally be broken down by a road linking the city centre to suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, funnyly referred to as the non-charismatic "reserve" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown rapidly since his victory and his Friday performance, which was aimed at presenting him not only as a candidate for Islamistism, but also to all those who want to bring to an end the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with red tie judges in a wooded chamber where he made an oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to give an opening speech.
While he was watching, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The presence was the military commander of the full marshal Hussain Tantava.
His arrival was accompanied by a scan of “army and people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the center of secular education and later became a garden of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, a place where a revolution that ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubarak was born, and solemnly promised that he would regain the presidential power of his office by the military council that had taken it from the discharged leader.
But I agree with the formal oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as usual, that he has surrendered to the will of the army, which suggests that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's performance at Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos. They're supposed to ease the tension.
In Czech ghettos, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They'd spend half their time here.
They'd watch the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people from surrounding areas.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior shall do so.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "stimulating social housing".
The document was negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis, around 300 poor homes and neighborhoods were in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
He lived in them for 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
The adults in the ghettos were unemployed, the families were dependent on the doses, the children ended up in "special" schools.
She's been blushing.
According to experts at problem locations, a hundred arrived in the meantime.
Relations between their people and others are sparked.
In a few places, anti-Rome marches took place.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the inside, there is a need for police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
The basic condition is "consistent application of equal access to the exercise of the right".
But without a detailed knowledge of the place and people can't be reached.
A specialist would go for a walk in a ghetto where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd watch the order in the trouble room.
He would also know locals, so he could better solve problems or crimes.
"Thanks to this trust, experts will be more easily able to prevent the whole range of illegal proceedings," he said inside.
ghetto specialists would get extras, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into trouble areas is to be supported by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million kroner).
The Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, 85 per cent of the funds.
Preparations began this year, and now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is to be completed by 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years to Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is not significantly higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis that identifies places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project has been completed.
According to the project's proposal, the first selection of police officers will complete the internship in Slovakia.
This training should be conducted annually by five dozen members.
The most suitable candidates will come in.
Special training should also be provided for police officers who will act in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
It's supposed to be three categories inside.
The minimum standard would comply with the precise rules of accommodation, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
Hirers would have to implement an integration plan that would include social workers.
They would have to keep the housing order, take care of their health, send the children to schools, qualify and actively look for work.
If they were trying to join, they would go to a higher standard of living.
The doorway housing system should operate within 30 years until the next generation is "in a pro-integrated environment".
The social housing model prepares resorts for local development and work.
They've got him proposed by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The Hungarian summit - one of our youngest soups.
The coal peak is an imaginary hill 3 km south-east of Bruntall.
Together with a few others, the document of a joint activity in the Low Jeseník is recent (geologically).
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance at the top of the Hungarian summit, the imaginable white baroque church of Miss Marie Auxiliary, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden beam cap.
The hotel that stood next to the church didn't stay.
Shortly after the church was completed, it was planted in a row of four July, about 1 km long.
The crossroads at the Hungarian summit is already the third version, the original one was after 1916, the second one, from 2001 until 2004.
Fifteen stops include wooden plastics made by local artist František Nedol.
He used different types of wood from the Low Jeseník area.
Similarly, the foundation of the mountains in the right-hand region is an interesting geological exposure.
Each stop shall contain the name of the sponsor.
The coal peak is the remnant of a young fox.
Although data from radiometric measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
So he's younger than Big Road (age 3.3 million years) and older than Venušina's soup (age 0.8 million years).
The sop was born with an explosion.
She threw a considerable amount of soybean ash together with pieces of the tops of the floor that were burned in red.
At the end of this phase it ran on the surface of the left - today it is a layer of a rowing chair up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption cast red, red and black tufy places.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the crack wall.
In the tufes there are supposed sophisticated pumas of up to 1 meter. And the second eruption was ended by a lava spill.
At the end of the operation, a lion has flown out of the soybean, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of a sharp jaw.
Soups where the casting of a coarse ash with lava springs is the most common type of soup.
Because they're actually made up of layers, they got the name of the stratovulcans.
The original coarse skin was gradually subject to erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining in the south.
The most intense effort was made here in 1953 - 1962.
The Tufs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The campaign succeeded in putting an end to this unique place under the pressure of experts and the public.
The problem, however, is in the continuity and low consistency of the horn, which quickly sprouts, decays, and dries down.
The break's going pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is a warm, south-oriented bond with ideal places for some rare species of plants and animals.
The repair is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
At the Hungarian summit you will get a green tourist brand from Bruntal, if any from Sleskie Kočov.
Automobiles can use free parking at the beginning of the lip loop, where they also start a short learning path.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a church villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas on Orechovce.
However, the original owners of the house received it in return and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
That's why Ivana was quick to look for a replacement home for herself and her older mother at the time.
She got a tip for apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and the changeover inspired me on the other side," recalls Ivana to the first impression.
At first, I thought it was going to be a provisional for three years.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only for the sake of gradual reconstruction would I not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 100-inch apartment to a smaller one with a surface area of 62 m2 and spread all the equipment.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in general good condition, but necessary adjustments had to be made, such as door painting or window exchange.
The previous owner blew up the core, but the owner had the most misdirected and overly large front, and rather a small bathroom.
A multifunctional living room was created by the merger of two rooms.
Architects have used to determine the individual zones and the compartment membership of Sadocarton, which has enabled the new location of the lights.
The first step that she decided to take after a few years was the removal of the parakeet in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room got into the air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivana didn't know how to use the bathroom.
For years, I picked up the housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So for the recommendation, I addressed the young architect Kamil Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the conversion of the bathroom, the available premises have also been modified.
The architect combined room WC and bathrooms and two doors with open wings replaced one moving, saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also quite unobstructed.
The quality covers imitate the sandstone, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, with a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Camille Doudér continued.
Within the order How the dream was built was a rapid but fundamental change in the living room, which was also shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, which were created by connecting two smaller rooms, without helping with the classic principles of optical division, such as semiconductor or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
Originally managed to separate the sleeping and living part.
It was enough to turn the back of the two sofas and place between them a peace-making box on the pillows.
The dining area defines the shade of the floor and the painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marble, revitalized the door with a pattern.
The kitchen corner shall, where necessary, cover moving panels with wallpaper.
The new floor of anti-allergic marble has opposite the front of the laminate of a number of advantages: a soft, non-slip surface with no spore and better sound insulation.
The system of highlights and previews of the sadocarton highlighted in colour is an indication of how to work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects. I wanted it to be happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The wall of the graphoscal with the motif of a blossomed magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To the warm energy tone, the architects chose a white one that undermined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, among other things, even under the parapets.
It's all within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the reworked interior works perfectly the contrast of a new one with an older one, for example with decades of old crystal mirror and with quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one in line came the kitchen.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed a bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and repositioned them.
The purchase in simple design is made on a contract, the white surface slightly softens the bead surface.
They went into the small space thanks to the supposed solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the washing machine.
The view of the small kitchen revitalized the glass wall above the work desk.
The unique graphics with a digitally printed motif is attractive and is also well maintained.
Ivana picked flowers of magnolia that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and washbasin, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the wall.
A large shower corner has a glass door to Ronal.
The aim was to create from this environment a clear simple space in which functions and facilities will be in harmony.
The interior we brought together materially and colourfully and tried for its elegant, cozy, not too full appearance.
"An additional condition of the task was a barrier-free solution with minimum obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of daily needs items," Kamila Doudérová adds.
The Supreme Court has ruled: Time and again it is possible to withdraw.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Netimes could also be sued for possible criminal acts that could have been allowed before the August resolution of the Ambassador's House.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which relates to performances in the Snowhouse.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS Members Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schnajdra and Petra Tluchoře, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until last November, Mr Knotig, spokesperson of the Supreme Court, said.
By this decision the Court rejected the proposal by the State representative Iva Ištvana, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the MP.
According to him, they accepted payment in the form of lucrative positions in state firms for giving up their mandate and not having problems in the adoption of laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can still complain.
Vít Barta also detained anti-corruption police officers
Bart's defender, Oldrich Chudoba, who also represented her in the alleged corruption of the VV Members, also refused to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but because of the protection of the hidden facts, I cannot comment on it any more."
According to the information, the case is handled by the General Safety Congregations Inspectorate (GIBS).
The server said that Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server of the first sentence.cz, the case may have been linked to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Barta was allegedly attempted.
The latest information of the Law, however, shows that the detention of Vít Barta with Peter Lessy is not related.
The spokesperson of the police president Eva Kropáč refused to comment on the case of the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this issue in view of the protection of hidden realities," said the spokesperson of the City State Office in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
The case is under the supervision of the Court of Justice, and its words therefore directly indicate that the case or criminal proceedings are conducted in a concealment regime.
Reporter News managed to reach the wife of Víta Barta Katerín Klasn in the morning before their residence in Prague.
She just loaded the suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to express herself on the whole occasion.
On Friday morning, the leader of the movement, Tomio Okamura, expressed himself at Bart's detention.
According to his own words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
"The life of Barta was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the August direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he added.
Wít Barta, who has failed in his previous early elections to the Plzeňský region to run for the Movement of the Direct Democracy of Tommy Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause of paying Members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was unjustly convicted for 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Afterwards, the judgment was changed and Barta was acquitted of the charges.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I've still got a crush, a desire and a enthusiasm.
For Prospala, she was always in the first place as a family, so she wanted to be fully subordinate to her 38 years.
Either he gets a job abroad and he's still going on his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says a hockey player who is still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-declared employee who never does anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice, and he can cut off the teammates.
And despite the fact that he was last season's most productive player in Columbus.
"But the desire to show everything is still within me," he says decisively.
Maybe he'll wait, he's probably standing up for New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season, and they also have two wounded resistances - attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival at the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, it doesn't matter.
I know there's an article in the New York Post newspaper that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Didn't they even call you from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the deal really comes.
When a player gets hurt, or someone doesn't do it, and the manchat doesn't run.
There's a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get the contract.
But there are exactly the same circumstances in New York, aren't there?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, that's always the chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
That's the sad reality I have to live in.
You fly to America on Friday, are you expecting anything to happen?
I have the expectation of July 5th, when the NHL opened up the market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm not. I'm going to Tampa for kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and to seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
That's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play my dad and my husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, your boy has two hockey games, it's for me and my whole family to celebrate when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in a full tanker?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that every goal, victory and play doesn't pay you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's get you the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever meet except my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, it's also a sport success in the first place - except for the family.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, that is, forgiveness, our children - my women - grew up in States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd love to continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to do is, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America?
We'll practice it as we do.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Deep and around the Czech Budjejovic.
And again in the winter in Tampa or where our steps will take us.
It's perfect to be still warm.
I've had a lot of happiness in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it took a lot of strength and denial and took a lot of things that I missed.
But the payroll hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we and our wife can choose where to live.
There are many people in the world who long for this to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have in your age willing to smoke, practice hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the team, the fan, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna last.
That's not gonna be planned.
So you can say you're waiting for this season to get out and then decide what to do?
I'm in the middle of a day.
The ČEZ Director-General has recently announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant will be postponed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and by agreeing to the Contracts of Difference government.
For these reasons, the current ČEZ management is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations, not hide behind the shareholders.
Granny: I'm only with the government on Saturday.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to calm down that his movement of the UN will have no time to learn a political profession in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create something at all.
The President of the United Nations has approved this in the debate on the Law, which will take place tomorrow.
Trade and marketing ŠkoFIN leads Abrahamek
Its competences include the area of product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludık Shantor.
For the last 14 years, Abraham has joined the car sector in his career.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for Alfa Romeo's brand and dealership for seven years.
His last post was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of the car division manager for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was born in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport for the shooting.
At the Los Angeles International Airport this morning, a gunshot was fired.
The police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly it was terminal three.
Agent Reuters, in response to a call from the California media, claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, indicated that there was a gunshot wound to two or three members of the Transport Safety Management.
How many people have been hurt in general and if there are some victims, but it's still not obvious.
Hasitches are talking about events with a larger number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hizballáh.
On Thursday, Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakia.
With a call from the nominee, the U.S. government announced this to CNN television.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the data warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
The Israeli army's voice on the CNN's question refused to comment on the flight.
"We do not speak to foreign media reports," she said.
The Israeli approach was aimed at the US government's source of rockets and related equipment, which the Israelis believe could be transported to Hisballáh's militant Lebanese movement.
The AP with a call on another U.S. security factor reported that the target of Israel's entry into the Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 rockets.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the aim of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the attack area but according to the DPA agency showed Russian missiles of type S-125 Neva.
In addition, they saw the SA-3 missile battery, including the command centre, with radar to monitor the missiles and their targets.
The recorded rockets are reported to have reached 35 kilometres of Israeli television and could carry heads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has allegedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will attack any supply of weapons to Hizballáhu or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from the plaintiffs in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic income before tax to move between US$ 325 million and US$ 340 million against US$ 305 million to US$ 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a 12-to-seven-percent increase towards the record profit of USD 290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an eight-percent profit in the first half of the year and the second half began to grow rapidly mainly in Australian and British travel off the service route.
"To this day, our 10 countries have profits and several are targeting record annual profits before interest and taxation," he said.
This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit maker.
The company with recreational activities was built up in Australia during the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain, Flight Centre managed well in the recreational area, while the company’s customers lost less.
After the loss, American trade recovers during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a third in a row of annual profits.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at a level of $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to Petrograd
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting the planned extraction of oil in the Arctic have been transferred from Murmansk to Petrograd.
She informed the AFP agency today with a call to the International Greenpeace Environmental Organisation.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her activists for piracy have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil rig in the Arctic were transferred from a repair facility in Murmansk to a Petrograd prison," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, the move was planned.
Ecology authorities first accused of piracy, which threatened them for up to 15 years in prison in the event of conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that this charge would be replaced by a milder extortion, which threatens the lower sentence with the seven years of deprivation of liberty.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the government's piracy charges have not yet been dropped as promised.
This means that detention is now charged with two criminal offences.
The Strong Investigation Committee announced last week that the charge of piracy would replace the charge of extortion.
However, when 30 prisoners stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy had not been dropped.
Instead, a new indictment was filed against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three tenths of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody for which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of prison.
According to AFP, CEO Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo today stated that the move to Petrostadt will facilitate meetings held with families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from King Willem-Alexandra, one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeine Dagblad, the monarch called on him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Malik has a large share in revitalizing sectarian violence in Iraq, which is, in part, part of the fights also in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
During the hours of English literature, at least one game of Shakespeare, a novel from the 19th century, Romantic poetry, and modern British literature will have to be studied since 1914.
The test will also include 'hidden text' to motivate further reading;
Combined courses of English literature and languages will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language exam and will be offered to choose English literature as a optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new foundations for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other key subjects, the changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Offqual authorities, which supervise the graduation exams, discover changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new labelling system and a smaller amount of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system to regain the trust of society" and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test is "more demanding, ambitious and more stringent".
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison schools in Australia, the maths spend an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to spend more time on mathematics, coalition resources have indicated that a comprehensive math graduation test – together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the result bars – is likely to encourage schools to provide additional training.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostravski primátor Kainar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, the long-standing dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the ČSSD was fully burned.
It all came true when the Prime Minister of the island of Petr Kainar turned to court for non-democratic appointment of candidates.
The defendants, however, did not want to say too much so as not to cause further damage to the party before the elections.
But now the vote of the voters has been counted.
The management of the Ostrava ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening called the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step out of the way, and he will probably press on to lose his function.
But Peter Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What's in the dispute, and who's on her side, he described in an exclusive conversation for Deník.
How do you feel about the outcome of the election?
ČSSD must have calculated with a much better result.
Did it hurt us that before the elections, they had to settle in the media disputes inside the party?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's the party that has its internal problems, it's internally sick, and people think it's not all right in it.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are these internal ČSSD diseases?
I've been going through ODS for some time now, and things like this are unfortunately being played in social democracy.
It's like lobbyists, affect people who used to expect to find their shelters at the ODS, move to the people in the ČSSD and have an influence on them.
Then it's connected to the fact that after the Ostrava magistrate's office, the police go and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who would want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two insurmountable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hašek's wing gradually held its position so that the elections could lead to a situation that weakens the Sobok's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he has to compromise at times.
But everyone has some internal limit when the compromises are no longer going, and that's my case.
Originally I didn't want to run for the studio, but when I realized the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zarabalk that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen the Sobotka's wing as a prime minister of Ostrava.
The hash's wing gave way to it.
Why are you standing on the side of God's glory Saturday, and not Michal Hask?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to a certain extent about the visas for the party and this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Haszek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the Chairman of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything and against the states party.
In my view, what Michal Haszek has now presented in Prague ended his political career.
How did you realize that the ČSSD's island leadership did not approve of you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on competition, which is how their members are placed.
This competition should be based largely on programme visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, there are people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party is calling for money that they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead of themselves, because they don't want to break the rules, they violate the party's position.
They do so by their practices on the political side of the mafia and, I believe, they violate the laws of the Czech Republic as well.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Keinar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the positions.
So, have you submitted a preliminary motion for a preliminary action against the form of a candidate for the ČSSD in the Moravian Region before the elections?
The current ČSSD’s current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava confirms its power by allowing organisations that do not comply with it to cancel, to set up a new organisation, gradually to expel the uncomfortable members of the party.
One example is that they wanted Richard Bednarík to be expelled from the representatives' club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they decided to cancel his exclusion.
This shows that enforcement of the party's position through the courts is the last option, but at a time when the other modes and control authorities within the ČSSD ceased to function, that is the only option.
The aim of the management of the ČSSD is to withdraw you from the position of prime minister in front of Mr. Adam Rykalow.
It's a public secret that this post has the condolences of Mayor Prouby Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me back.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they strengthen their power on the side.
When I go back to the past, everything that must have happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the Bazala stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me a person who gives money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought a property that was strategically valuable to it.
So how do you see it with your delay in acting as prime minister?
The Committee of the Regions has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our delay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief shouts, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would have initiated and planted, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as the need for industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm becoming uncomfortable.
I don't read it other than to prevent others from getting into places they're looking for.
Are you going to fight them again?
Because if this republic is to function well, then the political parties must also function well.
I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively drive the state when it can't even drive itself.
I don't think I'd leave ČSSD now, because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but these people who are trying to educate me.
Lolouc opens in the historical centre of the public centre
The organizer of the Olympic Christmas Markets and Winter Spasm Paul Burné stated that the preparatory work at the theatre was started on 26 October and is operating on ice aggregates since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The castle has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
The brusllers and the passersby will also have two benches with a punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, expanded the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podia is covered so that the brewers can easily be renamed," the writer described.
Olomouse Street already remembers the coming Christmas.
Last year the theatre for the repair of the Lower Square was installed right before the main entrance of the town hall at the Upper Square.
Correction of the Lower Square was completed at the turn of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to break down directly before the councillors in 2009, when there was a loophole in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural programme, will be launched in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of seniors in Zlinska will be retrialed by a regional court
The national court has acquitted the accusations of the Slovak and Czech for the lack of evidence.
The men rejected the guilt.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years in prison or with an exceptional penalty.
Speaker Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had overturned the regional decision and brought the matter back to the hearing.
The reasons leading the judge refused to comment that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the accusation, the young man had fallen into his house for seventy-seven years.
The senior died of a tragic death.
According to the accusation, her men were scratched, dug and dug all over the body, and also with a metal object, probably a gas gun, they put about three tenths of the wounds into his head.
He suffered serious injuries, such as a fracture of the liver bone, a stroke of the brain, or bleeding into the brain that he was exposed to.
The youths reportedly carried 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the accused’s scent trail, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
In more than ten cases, foot-and-mouth stains from the scene of the crime were compatible with the accused, but the police initially treated them as material and not foot-and-mouth.
In addition, certain doubts have been identified when dealing with them.
According to the Senate, there was no evidence of the guilt of the accused.
However, the Court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he must have fallen and hurt himself.
Even a dedicated rescue doctor did not notice the violent death.
Even after a few days, the criminals had been contacted by breaking doctors who discovered signs of violent death during drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the tracks from the crime scene that their relatives cleaned up.
There's no DNA on the scene.
Young Slovak lived in Uherskogradišk.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which he was confirmed by a powerfully breaking Supreme Court last year.
According to him, a man was the head of an organized group of six young men who had a consciousness of a devastating fall in gold.
The robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the senior in Slopne.
The younger of the accused of the murder of the senior lives in Uherska Hradišt.
He was released by the court in August after 11 months.
The sweat starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who will carry out the construction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages in order to produce standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week's autumn
The Saxophone Grand and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday of the 18th year of the Struna Winter Festival.
Shorter will be released on November 6th in the Grand Hall of Lucerne together with its quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonic under Martin Kumžák will be added to the Shorter.
In shorter arrangements for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus from the news album Without A Net, as well as his older Lotus and Prometheus Unbound compositions, will be recorded.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of power, which also proves that the Prague concert in the autumn ends his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The number of interpreters he worked with ranges from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell, to Carlos Santana.
He also met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitoš and Vienna's cousin Joe Zawinul, who were given a new style of fusion in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade.
For the past 13 years, he's been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Like the after party after the festival, there will still be a club night in Spotlight, which will take place on November 9th at the Roxy/NoD Club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany presents to the foreign audience the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with his jazz- influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electro-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Ladies and gentlemen, UEFA prohibits the publication of sentences for the judge.
Dagmar Damkova, chairman of the decision-making committee of the Czech Football Association, stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which it has mentioned in the discussion for the law journal.
Otherwise, he'd be threatening the FAČR position.
The lady also refused to share her role with the Plzna footballers where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plzi, but the other members of the commissions are obnoxious, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," said Damkova in response to the criticism, which got angry after Plzeň played twice as much penalty as the other league teams.
So even though FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the judge in recent months, Damkova assures the judges that they hate their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, the delegation will limit it to any defeat," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to the Dam's ban on the European Union football.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and the violation of strict penalties."
"We're very suspicious of each other and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very important warnings that if we do not stop this, hard sanctions will come," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continued to be published, the Commission could lose money from UEFA on education and decision-making.
"And you are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't fill the educational program," Damkova added.
The detention of Barta is related to Januske and Behem: Are they behind the command?
The President of Public Affairs of Vít Bart arrested the police on Thursday.
Along with him was also detained by the leading committee of analysts and informatics Anti-Corruption Police Jan Petržílek.
The detention relates to the departure of the lobbyist Roman Januška and former Prime Minister Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the senders with whom the server Novinky.cz has arrived confirmed the Czech press office a confidential source.
Listened phone calls Januška and Bema, which were published last March by the Mladá front today, in which both men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibríku", show the influence of Januškov on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
The Journal then stated that in 2007 it was managed by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL Security Agency.
That's when he owned Bart.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek was working before his entry to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption service that was subsequently taken care of, Petržílek moved on at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot at all confirm or say anything at all," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City State Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that the case was under surveillance.
The case does not want to comment on any inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new civil law
The coming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Trade Corporation Act as of 1 January 2014 is being intensively prepared by six companies out of ten.
Only eight per cent of the company’s respondents indicated that the issues associated with both key codes in their company had not been resolved at all.
It comes from an investigation by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, who has found the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching deadline for the effectiveness of both key codes, it is only now that a number of managers are becoming aware of the significant impact they can have on their company’s business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
For the sake of policy-laundering, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty whether or not there will eventually be revolutionary changes.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to new rights for their companies without any complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Sáčil.
Of the 61 per cent of companies intensively involved in the new legislation, 26 per cent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 per cent of the companies in this number are going to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet forgotten the recodifications, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 per cent have no opinion, and the problem cannot be assessed.
Only eight percent of companies admit that the issues associated with the recasts have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil law is the maximum number of companies in question for the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), the solution of trading conditions (16 per cent) and the change in the real estate and liability for damage (ten per cent).
Contracts play one of the most important news of the entire recoding, namely the unification of the adjustment of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom to arrange relations," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukaš Poddány.
In relation to the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the most relevant issue of increasing the responsibility of the statutory authorities.
The following are topics relating to changes in the calling and running of the rolling stock (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal framework means strengthening the obligations and possible effects for the statutory authorities, in particular where companies are at risk of or achieve failure.
"In practice, this means that if members of the representations and contractors of the company do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the dangerous collapse of the company, they may benefit from the performance of the function for the last two years," Spačil added.

Travels through the bay, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every week hundreds of patients
In West Africa there are not too many doctors; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Hernin Prize 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the ten main candidates in the competition for the 2013 CNN Herdin.
The winner will earn $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle has been watching his father fall into unconsciousness again and again and goes to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon’s capital, Yaounde, in 1981.
At first he was treated with only a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain, and there he developed a hematoma that affected him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., hurry to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team did 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor of herbal surgery at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he set up a non-profit organization like ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit rural areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helped by their volunteer group.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people rush to the supplies, climb to the medical needs roofs, and travel by rough terrain to the villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
All of a sudden, vehicles have to push through the river and the bay.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: host, song and dance and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages medical care is free of charge for real reasons to celebrate and Bwelle – with her wide smile and unspoiled energy – is very willingly involved in local joy.
Next day, the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every shipment," Bwelle says.
They come to the village about 60 kilometers away, and they walk.
During each of these weeks, doctors provide various health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, hyperglycaemia, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get glasses or glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that requires a school, but which many loved families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local drugs.
The surgery usually takes place in a building school, at a councilhouse or at home; after surgery the patient gets up and goes to the place of recovery to relax the place of another patient.
With the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers, they work within hours of emergency.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay up and keep working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired, but proud of its work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year and realizes that their assistance can mean a great deal to local residents.
One man said he'd be able to work again after the surgery.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekly clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital also works at night for private clinics around Yaounde.
It says that this second job is financed by around 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he actually sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia the second year and working as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle in his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"Dr. Bwell, we washed our hands thoroughly and removed blood clots or held his tools," says O'Malley.
You'll never experience it as a medical student in America this second year.
Voluntary students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon alone and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
"Surely it's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
Bwelle's constant push is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwell says.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát restored the post of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of the nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office - representatives to whom they can always address if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the sister's work, and I think that the nursing sector deserves appropriate attention from the Ministry.
In carrying out this profession, not only is there a need for high professionalism, but there is also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm happy and with all my responsibilities, I'll try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and generous nurses in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, by their approach to patients, do not help us too much to perform their professions with all their empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of the sister," says Alena Schmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Schmidová, also stated that she wanted to take care of the various aspects of the nurse's position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, teachers, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to divide the profession of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing next to me, each with its own competence, and together with other health workers, there is a busy working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I am faced with a number of problems that arise in the performance of my sister's profession, these discomforts I perceive and intend to share in their solutions."
These include, for example, the simplification of medical and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the nurses are too heavy and take the time that they could and should spend better on patients," says Alena Schmidová.
Other areas to be targeted include improving working conditions, seeking ways to improve team and management of health services providers, adapting skills and labour law issues such as compliance with the labour law or non-transmission of their sisters with insufficient numbers at the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous passages that, out of fear of possible position, are not documented in a specific case where a violation of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the main sister of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the retention of anonymity of such a complaint and the specific case should be checked by the competent authorities," concludes Alena Schmidov.
Mgr. Alena Šmidévá studied the Secondary Health School in the field of Health Sisters (advanced in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlovy in Prague in the course of the School of Health - Education (advanced in 1992).

To keep from becoming haters
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years, when he read, lived, but did not write, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes the new novel Wind, Dark, Presence.
That it is not a narrow link, it suggests the number of parties comparable to its most famous part of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the day - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so that I wouldn't get caught up in hate.
To see all around you new and new clones of human shameful malignancy, young organisms affected by blind self-esteem.
I'm not talking about us older or older, the faces ruined by powerless petition, the wimp's soul, and the opposite over-repeated ideologists who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of little whores.
In the beginning of the thousand years, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my legal friends, strangers, and hidden servants.
I've been through this.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I'd like to go for a walk, and then I'm at the lighthouse reading the book.
You're talking about a sense of doom, hate.
Was there something bad that affected you in the past, or are you just getting old like us all?
A break once occurred about ten years ago.
There was no name at the time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see another lonely circus, each in his own tower of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I take part in this massive, thousand years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
Those restless, breath-taking complexes of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when by way of experiment-omyl there is another and another generation of beings that in billions of interactions in a second create some superlative, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you take your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
A dialogue that leads to the right and left half of the brain, or better said, sometimes floats to the level and forms in the book.
Like a period of peace that is covered by sleepy metastases of wars that may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the way my life's vibes grow in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day they'll knock me out.
It's a file of questions that formulated the brain and sets them on layers that are stored in the darkness "under a deep consciousness".
Neocortex, a gray brain cortex, asks older evolutionary services, goes to the ancient aerospaces of the brain tree.
He's talking to slender sails, he's asking for snakes, he's looking for an answer in the flight of birds, he's raising his sight to the clouds of the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
Finally, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively often you express yourself metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person concerned has experienced.
This forest is logically and emotionally exhibiting and growing with trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is constantly exposed to variable presence, in an unfathomable effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's an overload disorder.
Analogically - as if you were "falling" PC, from the language emulator program and translators from foreign languages you would be confused first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after a few failed restarts you ended up in the dark green publishing screens of Bios, in the basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what it is - I am talking about a mental crisis.
You remember her often - why are you interested in this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In addition to the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a gap.
Here's a good sense of Nietzsche: "He was looking at the crash for so long when he looked at it."
The real feeling is that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "dying" and a new quality emerges.
And why do I care?
I'll answer in a parable.
Once one fell into the shade and melted, ran for days, months, and years, he kept warm and read, and those books taught him how to swim, so to live.
He's become a melter.
Perhaps someone will help me with some of the words I wrote, as the Hrabal's texts have helped me.
To what extent do you mean a reader, a specific person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything meaningful, one of them called it consciousness, another super egem, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best described it in his friend's letter:
"I'm someone else - this reader is involved directly in the word and sentence formulation process."
Since his early youth he has read books of old Czech legends, sailed in the underside of Captain Noma, ran for Stindals in dark streets.
Finally, after all the inspiration of the authors and their message, it sounds like "the sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynka Machya".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back of the mirror that's coming to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they're accidentally contacting me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "life" or rather called "worlds."
They are encoded into the characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can awaken them to life whenever we let their senses flow into the brain.
It is actually, in its own way, something forbidden by God - to bring forth other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
That's the fact that DNA is stored in the spell - according to old demonic books, we're going to allow witchcraft.
After the book has been published, as is the case, a series of author readings awaits.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to get back into it with joy, or do you feel that way after years?
I'd rather talk like that today.
And what did I find out about it?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basics - they're invincible, they don't notice themselves too much, they have friendly visions, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope he's still alive) was one stupid book shop (called suitable June), a happy friend and a good girl's bull.
At one drink he introduced me to the individual articles of a series of readers of my book Houstina.
I looked into their eyes and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
I've been in bed for a while, and I've just been in bed, and I've been crying for a little while.
We've all been standing there with our milk and we've all been sleeping and we've been drinking.
Then the young blonde blender couldn't stand it and jumped his head out of the window into the snowflake.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night-land and drove a happy stream of sensors, a sick soul of landscapes, and a bunch of fallen owners - they went out and moved like werewolves until the morning.
Every book of yours is formal and content other than those of the past.
Does it also apply to the wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin inserts in his novel Suchodol into the mouth of the human healer the words of one old Russian baja: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, there's a rabbit on it.
Fear, fear, secret.
It's never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be devilish in hell and we used to throw - what role will we play on this earth?
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free stream of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unremarkable, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our desire from such a depth and so wide that it completely exceeds our perception - and so with absolute certainty we are doing exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with dopamine influenza, endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, die in defense and get new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we're going to feel compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shores of the ocean of ignorance, and in the hole of a dirty pocket, it captures the inflows of the wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama resigns from health care
After criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health program, you can keep it".
With hundreds of thousands of notifications of statements from the Republican suppliers in recent days, the President has been accused of slandering the American public.
Obama broke his original promise yesterday.
“A large majority of people with functioning health insurance can leave them,” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of what he called "a media riot" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to look for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Available Care Act.
"I am saying this to these Americans on a level: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Available Care Act, said that the launch of the internet market had been "sudden" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sébelius, who was caught by a microphone, spoke yesterday to a councillor sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which took place after the stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned with whether she herself should be involved in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the "architect" of the Available Care Act did not voluntarily surrender to the government of sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now forcing millions of Americans.
What billionaire are you gonna call next year?
Keelner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies confirmed the proceedings, and according to the various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction notification should take place in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for the LTE network, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG's own group.
The Sazka Telecommunications has been awarded a frequency auction for the LTE network.
And to the general surprise, by that time, the company's taste of entering telecommunications had not been talked about.
But Sazka is now conducting a highly experienced telecommunications company called Robert Chátal.
He began as a marketing chief of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovenian T-Mobile and was the head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The bet's playing a couple of cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she's admitting she wants to start a virtual with Vodafon.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be appreciated under normal circumstances, but according to the Economic News, it could be part of much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from a competition agreement between O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their network.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If this succeeds in a trend on the LTE network (as a novelty can hold a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to be allowed to auction, it will not be concerned with the performance of a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone lets Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respective of the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing companies to quickly start the network.
The rate between this starts to build a load network of LTE which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be happy.
Then Vodafone could lose money as a supplier of solid internet or cable television.
What about Kellner?
The buyer of Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovene branch is a daughter of Czech) would immediately receive a fully valued operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole that's gonna be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction LTE network, Kellner would have already won O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that the networks will be shared.
The auctions could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking at.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will the Czech TV ever go around without signing events?
In the era of President Zeman, a legendary ashtray scene has been introduced, and it is not difficult to hear complaints that gather documents of opposition from the castle family.
In the past, no one has documented the influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tördík, but to sign it.
The truth is, management has become the editor.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a tendency of some journalists to landowners is being taken - whether it is a reaction to the direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of a non-local empathy.
And when we are already assuming general flexibility, the question cannot be asked whether the changes in television conditions are being made to other unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given an opportunity.
They are right to say that in advanced countries there is no way of getting involved in political intervention.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints on the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they are critical of what they consider to be a tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't grown up in this civilisation stage yet, and we don't have this situation.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a transparent situation affecting the behaviour of many imperfect human beings.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: the presidents of the country
It is almost a rule that in key circumstances the head of state was not in such a way as to fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally younger than five years, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after a symbolic resistance flight could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed and the government could run to London right away and not work there for its legitimacy.
And mostly from that capitulation, he wouldn't have a coconut nation until today.
Benez wasn't a stateman, and he was still in the state for Munich, but in the war, he was already out of the mountains, and in February 48 he was acting on it.
Being on something better, he could have gone to the third exile and violated the legitimacy of the communists and their puppies.
It's a shame to talk about The Hague.
They chose him to "Mr. President won't be able to decide".
But he had to, even though it wasn't a big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's office.
By the last days of March 1939, František Moravec, the head of the survey, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation he knew on the exact day was not so smoother and with such gain.
The senate president and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human concern of Gottwald had him fix his summer mates, as Moscow had instructed him.
The Freedom Man definitely denied his share of normalization and had to sit down, already quite senile.
That Hussak was a powerless and sick depressed old man of the event in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only deposit.
Havel was lucky to have not met him in the office for the last few years, was saved by the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his activities make him realize that thinking processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and chief commander of the armed forces looks like he looks and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the republic's external threats now.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not like that.
Then the question is whether it is not exceptional (historically good) that the President is not fully in power.
It's not normal.
Could we not elect a president in this country once again someone acceptable to think and to be healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white films, or some fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth, are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would promote ice-cream.
In the sense of his quartet, which will end this year's anniversary of the Struna festival in the autumn, on 6 November in the large Prague hall of Lucerne, everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his mission, two generations younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as fully improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film pictures.
This principle, however, is freshly eighty-year-old Shorter - the extraordinary composer, the wearer of nine Grammy, a former partner of Miles Davis, and today the most prominent living jazz saxophoneist - doesn't like to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80 ’ s, I thought it was best to let my life come as a surprise.
"Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things develop differently," says Shorter.
How the mosquitoes from Thailand set up Paris bar markets
Maybe you're looking over the manure, but you don't know that you're dreaming about half a pound a year.
For example, it's scattered in the moose.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you have also taken care of a unique experience.
He placed the offer of butter as the first in Paris on his company's menu at the beginning of October Elie Daviron, a chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, whose name was the inspirational book William Burroughse Night lunch, you would find in the fashion 18th district near Montmartru a very visited tourist.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, garlic and egg yolks, guests can taste not only various larvae, sausages or water pants, but also four.
Carefully and specially packed supplies (in order not to damage the skin’s wings, legs, or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe's only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pro-step menu immediately gives a few reasons why to consume butter.
The first is an ecological benefit, because the production of manure is much less expensive for our planet (which concerns finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, wet is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron to the Reuters station.
At the same time, a young chef does not stop his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just mediating new experience," he explained.
Not everyone in the world would think that it consumes a broken pessam, but the response of customers of the Paris bar to served manure is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics end up enjoying themselves, even though they start with the smallest systems and eventually choose scorpions.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyás: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the state does not want to solve the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, following the implementation of the measures, will reduce significant amounts of heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each investment billion will bring the state more than 2,700 newly created jobs.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the State, there are significant side effects and multiplication effects, which are also one of the most important growth measures.
The link between the companies in the construction of the Czech Republic therefore in principle disagrees with the government's resolution and requests that such steps be taken to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be identified within it.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog snorted the blanket, the president buried and finished about the beers
President Miloš Zeman left a motorcycle hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on the bed and went to the castle in Lanach.
What's he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "went too far"
John Kerry pointed out that the U.S. defence position had changed with regard to his follow-up programmes and said, in an unprecedented recognition, that in some cases the espionage had "extremely gone".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also acknowledged that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a “autopilot” in view of the gross detection of NSA spying activities, which was revealed by informant Edward Snowden.
Public information caused diplomatic storms between the American government and its allies.
Through video-connection to an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that are being done out of curiosity, because this was the option, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of the cold war and then of course the 11 September."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no violation of the rights was violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain it to people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one can feel that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of the innocent in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is working for the good and that its follow-up operations have saved many lives.
He added: "We are in the midst of a new world in which people are willing to burn themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is firmly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from breaking down, and people from being repaired because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that US legislators are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad concerning alleged American espionages, and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that he was concerned about their threat that he would stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important for Europe to remain on a single ship with us, in view of the joint effort in the fight against terrorism, Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party, and the chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on foreign relations for European affairs, said.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism despite their rebellion against NSA programmes.
The reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some American allies, although the Agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata collected and shared by NATO allies with the United States,
Another discovery was quoted in the documents cited by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of the German office of Angela Merkel and other to 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Reporting, James Clapper, defended the spying of the allies as necessary and said that he was one of the two sides on the common issue.
In the midst of a call, Murphy said that his office was planning a parliamentary trip that should be carried out this year, and hoped that members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators who intend to participate shall be published in the following days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the road is to help improve relations, he added that they would also be prepared "a well-reduced educational measure".
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they use for years themselves.
"While we are adjusting our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones who are implementing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is planning this weekend to move to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to the impunity already created by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and also by the US follow-up.
Australia appealed against a stay in Thai prison
Twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-week prison on Phuket Island when she said she was falsely attacked by a taxi driver, called off the verdict and was released for bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially accused by the Land Court on June 15th on Phuket Island of a guilty charge when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who had detained her was attacked in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television record later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police were conducting interviews with Bamford for two days before she learned that she had an accident.
Prior to the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a correctional facility with a low guard on the outskirts of Phuket instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who, in the case of his daughter, asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that it will return to us as soon as possible safely," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime she spent her vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to a judicial procedure that would increase her punishment and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian employee, the travel office of Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a shameful image for tourists, which may have been a liberating verdict.
The jagger's got a joke, "Got out of the broom"?
In the defense tape, he got a crack and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape changed after a quick forend call.
Jaromír Jágr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, then on Thursday evening 119 winning goals in NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petru Svobod called the Director of Czech Drags and asked him if I should be interested in making an ad on their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote to the introduction with an overcrowded Jágr.
I think we're kind of much alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish my night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense might then come forward and want to make an ad on the press!" added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey won the second round.
"And above all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rothr takes away," said Jágr.
Place of acceptance of the candles for the reception of the candle
The empire's election was more than the winners brought a bunch of losers.
These are not only the parties that did not even get to the Post office (e.g. SPOZ) but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal divide.
Instead of the Christmas candles, we were served by politicians for the weekend of the election gulás.
The jump of the election was the movement of Andreje Babi, which promised the voters to change the political style of government.
The division of the electoral result and the division on the winning side record political (for)the sake of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the will of the voters, who have not even elected the party that President Zeman publicly supported.
The President, however, has lost strategic momentum in front of other policies because of the unpleasant event, but he still has several ways to get it back - for example by choosing the future prime minister.
While ČSSD is getting the chance to get the first chair in my eyes, businessmen Andrej Babiš are approaching.
However, electoral development has been a long way away from the rapid and smooth establishment of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left government of the ČSSD-supported communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and hence the economy is just a better report.
Given the strong resistance of the UN to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely option of the ČSSD, UN and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 Members).
Due to a breakdown in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations may be enough to call for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD made up of "non-zemanovs" in the Garden is probably not going to pass.
Moreover, any government to which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats who can lead sooner or later to another split on the side.
So I ask myself, "Are we not able to make a self-reliance on other early elections?"
The next elections would be more of a referendum on the strength of the volitional mandate of the UN.
The ČSSD plans for introducing sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in taxes from revenue or the construction of the state bank have been hoped for under the table.
On the contrary, the ČSSD, UN, KDU-ČSL and Čivt parties agree, for example, on business support, medium-term fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the employment of disadvantaged persons, on the reduction of the VAT rate for the selected goods.
Third areas are most evident in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But now the ANO has a design, so the program is the most likely coalition of the ANO, the ČSSD, the KDU-ČSL would set itself on the right.
Which in my view is finally a better result than a left-wing program with tax on everything that's still moving in the economy.
