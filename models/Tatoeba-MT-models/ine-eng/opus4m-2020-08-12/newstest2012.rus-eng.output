Parliament does not support the amendment granting freedom to Timoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, during its amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal the article condemning opposition leader Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected at the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered unfavourable.
Judgment is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political place of the regime; the process in the West has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure under which the former Prime Minister was convicted was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
226 votes would be required for ratification.
Libya’s Victory
In the history of liberation, or the resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert without him the war is over.
It was time to identify the winners.
Islamists generally win in the country; whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Sharia law, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country because the punishment for stealing is the cutting of hands.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; etc.
Instead of the dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
In Libya there will be an order that we can't imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
Whatever the case, our way of life is neither the only one in our own race nor the best, and it would probably not be suitable for the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors received help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that they believe that NATO was led, not by the U.S. General, but by God, whose greatness they glorified after each crash.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We were involved in shooting, serving Islam, and our policies were freed from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce Libya's military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of the "crustians".
Even if the oil companies are unoccupied, will the black gold of Libya be practically free of charge?
They'll probably not get it, and then the West will eventually be able to stand up for useless protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
The New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently at the centre of investor attention.
The statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries reported GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy has been stable, Germany and France have demonstrated growth.
And yet the debt market is running high today.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy; now they focus on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary economic development assessments in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5 per cent; France grew by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany was better off than expected (growth by 0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease by 0.1 per cent (the initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP remained stable; according to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than forecasted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stable compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurozones and the European Union have demonstrated a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecast of analysts.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary fall of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Profits from both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the worsening situation in the region, the revenues of Czech bonds remain around 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Republic has been selected to Euro.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 and will celebrate the unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The National Team has successfully completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech Republic and the beautiful goal of Peter Iráchek, they won with an account of 1:0.
In the second team, the Czech team was happy to retain a significant advantage after the home match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and prepared a detailed report.
Practically nothing remarkable in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly because of the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the heroic Irishman; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vucinic became the most successful match couple after they lost two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
Since the first minute, the game has been very tense.
Both teams had difficulty in conducting the combinations; the game took most of the time to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the team of first-time owners, and further attacks on the defence line were accurately captured by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They made a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around the nuclear power station in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon after the student prayers before entering the building, both the United States and Israel were asked to die.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have established a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that it was clear that Iran had not given up attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, following student prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, both the United States and Israel were followed by a request for death.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing Iran ' s nuclear programme, the Israeli press will aim to establish both in Isfahan and in Natanz, where uranium enrichment is being carried out.
Question of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and dinner sausage
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are subject to higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent are overweight.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who have a healthy lifestyle.
We see once again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior associated with human development for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity eat free potatoes before a survey of the educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity are not involved in sports, but most of the families of today ' s schoolchildren, only 15% of them said that their parents had time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last year’s course, involving almost 900 primary students throughout Bohemia.
This is not the case for the second consecutive year, with the support of the General Health Insurance and Unilever insurance company.
To date, more than 12,000 students in 4-8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are the main determining factors that cause the number of children who suffer from either excessive weight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day, according to the breakfast-preecus-lanch-preecus-food scheme, which is one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition,” says one study.
No chain and sausage for dinner.
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of schoolchildren have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone breakfasts separately.
The worst openup was that in every tenth family, people would not have breakfast at all.
And yet, breakfast is the basis for the right day-to-day management.
The study has shown that hot food is used more frequently in families with children suffering from obesity.
Nearly every person, regardless of weight, drinks sweet refreshments every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is reduced by more than twice, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Build your own menu.
In another part of the study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) it was suggested to draw up their own menu based on the products proposed and based on their tastes and preferences.
“The preference of Czech children 12-15 years of age is far from ideal for healthy nutrition.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, meaty, and sweet dishes.
"Special concern is caused by the high popularity of sweet refrigeration drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main luncheon, the shepherd beat a bird with a small weight.
However, children were practically not interested in bees, fish and vegetables.
Motivated by a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided that relevant information is provided to them.
“Many participants in the study control group have demonstrated a significant improvement in healthy food preferences when they completed the survey after the finalization of the lecture,” the project said.
This has been particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet refrigeration drinks, more children have just preferred water.
In addition, as a primary care for children, birds and fish were more frequently reported, limiting the number of sweet care and roasting.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, professionals claim
In the first article on training for stylists, I visited the level of information in introductory exercises.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Three expert lessons in this area; non-standard clothing advice; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
It's a lot more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really filled with information.
This time, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, the other boy's figure without proper shapes, has another more norm.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce wide shoulders, remove the neck or add missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to highlight the figures of women such as Jennifer Lopes, that is, the owners of a brighter chest and thigh and tighter waist, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and thigh is so large that there is no need to improve the beauty or skirt, there must be at least one thing on the order.
Obviously, you won't regret the money you've invested, because the ideal sitting clothes are worthless.
You'll feel a lot better in a kiss, on order, than in the one who always gets in, gets in, gets in, gets in, and so on.
On the other hand, the owners of small figures may wear clothes with solutions, applications, lifts or bearings.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant of the courses had to think about two sets for some celebrity: day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I need to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who's recently adjusted to a tone (please be aware that I'm surpassing), or quite young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of the magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphic programs.
Mudboard, which is called the result of the work, then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep a graphic style in mind.
The stylist does not just dress up real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the designer and designer Mario Stoneick told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
The Stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, was attended by three visitors to this area.
Stylist, Honza Suborna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist is able to use one object of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a suit can be worn normally, on the top of the jeans and football, like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, with no clues, like a coat.
Another option is to put the handle on or lift the trigger, and the whole picture changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we're putting all the definitions and rules together, what we're dealing with, and why, when we often see something else in fashion magazines.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I learned that a stylist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
Yes, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten pairs) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the object in the picture often looks and works in conjunction with others quite differently from reality.
We must have that in mind when we create the image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that image and style are often half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even well-known people often think of it as too much (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create them, we have to expect them to call us a different size than what they actually wear.
Then we're going to Google and we're going to find out if we've written tabloids about something that's got some sort of a big deal on the armchair, etc.
On Sunday, Honz and Mario stressed that a stylist would not be able to understand fashion and be able to improve at the same time.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not create them, and to hold to their views.
"If the manager asks you to take a look at her clothes and add some nice things, you can't throw out all her wardrobe, told her that her clothes were horrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be replaced specifically.
It's the bag you're tying around the plate to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as blades, sticky roll or English beads, it must be a nylon thread (stylists use it when taking some items, such as bag or hat), special clips to fasten the back fabric if it is too large (bulbs and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothes) or a set of hairs.
To get away from the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to do the right thing to make the slippers.
Even in studios where half-sweet and half-sweet can be damaged - not to mention street shootings.
And here we are.
You don't have to touch the shoes with knives to keep them from being exported.
This requires the present skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn't come to my mind.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the morning course.
I'm beginning to understand that being a professional stylist isn't so easy to say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and non-negotiable mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but that was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the sub-title "Run" there was great hope.
It was expected that it would move the previous series Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a worthy place in the game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero left the car and ran away.
As is often the case with NFS, there is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that there are several unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for several years.
This means, in fact, it is not a mistake, but an inexplicable array of developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You're on the west coast of San Francisco, and your task is first to get to New York.
There are a number of interesting features to consider.
The route consists of ten stages separated by more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes on its own course, and the individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
And yet the game doesn't give rise to strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, it is very pleasant to see autumn rewards or high in snowcapped mountains.
In addition, racing has been an unusual feature from time to time.
For example, in the wilderness you will fall into a sandstorm, which will cause you to lose much sight.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the lava.
Separate races are pretty well arranged.
There's only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you try to win a few opponents (in essence a normal race); then you try to improve the time (the standard race with a second) or you compete with one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you've come across a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of Jack's time escapes someone and you have to help him by pressing the buttons at the right time.
It's nothing difficult.
Although it's amazing that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that the game is good because it doesn't have to; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more busy.
The model is based on previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be regarded as a lack.
If you're looking for a real life, you're going to have to find somewhere else.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic driving, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, some time has passed since problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and collisions from this game, but if you don't have the idea of facing the object, how your car will act, something wrong.
Usually, when you drive or drive past a car in a flood, you sometimes easily get into another car, and sometimes, in a similar situation, your car is starting to get drowsy.
Or it was broken.
This isn't so important because of the restart system, but it's enough to make fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you break or leave the track, the game will bring you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start a race from the start.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't totally rely on it.
Sometimes a restart is not enough, and you need to start over a particular race area.
The important lack of play is the fact that the same things happen often in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to take place in a certain way, otherwise you just won't sign up.
In other cases, you will meet civilian cars in a particular location in the same configuration regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds sooner or one minute later.
This is particularly disturbing in situations where you see your opponent travel easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already in place so you need to either turn them around or drop the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re around them; it’s all set up in such a way that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
There are other advantages to the rivals.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent is attacking you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you in spite of anything.
The thing is, when he goes in front of you, he makes it worse for you to review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and stuffed with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's quickly starting to cause irritation.
Regrettably, despite a simple driving pattern, the game is busy and sometimes so saturated with events that you have no time to focus on what is happening around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss -- the concept with fifty unique tracks, the sequence of chases or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the luggage along the way, because that's what your car can switch on, even though in most cases what you already have is enough.
Machines are divided into three categories.
Sporting machines are geared towards cities; powerful American machines are for direct scissors; and exotic super-sporters for technical guidance, for example, on burnt mountain trails.
The main mode of story mode is closely related to the mode of challenge mode; it is a race on individual sites that you will learn about in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal case both medals and points, common to the modes of challenge and story.
Many options are available for higher driving: starting from cars and finishing profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other games and ensures communication with the public.
Here is another flaw that is hard to understand; it is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (we'll think so) where you're fighting for the rails in the dark (we'll think so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's assume so) when you suddenly get hit by a subway train, turning your car into a metal chest.
For a few days, our editor discussed whether no one really thought for a second at the time of the game, or did its creators really think of us as such.
The technical composition of the games is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video order is mostly pleasant, sometimes even shocking.
Unfortunately, at some critical times, the quality of the record is sometimes slowing down quite a bit.
This is particularly true of events with a large number of participants, where a good record would also not help you in particular.
Sound in order; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to meet as wide a young audience as possible, the soundtrack 'comes from different styles'; but hardly many people buy a game because of its music.
General impression about Need for Speed: Escape is quite indisputable.
If the game were to avoid obvious unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that escape is the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of infinity.
Of course, it's a good time, but be prepared to be blinded by the flaws as an airport projector.

The Ambassador to the EU of Vienna:
The Czechs have a reputation for non-beneficiaries and skeptics with respect to the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused significant differences between individual organizations”.
"I didn't expect such a cruel war to happen."
"It will take five or six years before the situation is even stabilized, and all players will get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenov gave a strong start to his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She demonstrated how much she was holding on to her "Clear and Open about Europe" motto in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simply and clearly that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law would be envious.
Moreover, Vizenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
“In the beginning, critics have said that he is a regular series of office mice that can’t perform any role; I must say that everyone has been struck how well he has done his role.”
"The person who can listen simultaneously to the twenty-seven participating countries is very good at communicating with them and has a clear understanding of which way to develop the EU."
She explained her new post on international relations and security issues as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; that is, how important a step towards unification and greater transparency in the Union ' s policies for countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
Vizenova has continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful Czech Presidency last year.
The Czechs have been dealing with the emerging financial crisis; they have overcome it and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the Government ' s resignation at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused little damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic is currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, the Presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused a continuing discard.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be poor and economical, what areas would be preferred; what countries would receive more support and what would be less; all these issues would be included in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "O Europe, an Understandable Language".
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargons that nobody understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or rounds, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese.'
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more checks into European organisations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
The Ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered Euro-Skeptics; as well as people who note rather negative and not positive aspects of things.
She wanted more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believed that there were several factors behind this: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful Czech Presidency, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Make sure that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we join the word, the French next to me says, 'Hey, what about the meeting, the Upper Town Group again?' and he doesn't like it.'
In the future, the Vienna Union looks forward to mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policies of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed if not a multi-speed Europe more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time it has been said that those who want to join, while those who do not want to, may remain side by side.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a two-speed Europe,” Vizenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all countries parties, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The innovative IBM enters into its existence in the second century.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one probably will be "long-term".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was set by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems can be solved easily if people want to think.
His slogan "Domai!" thus became a printing press that revolutionized the life of the future giant (as well as the name of his internal journal, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully developed.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more," says current leader Samuel J. Palmizano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the issue of employee care, as did Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, an elegant uniform and a complex bonus system for better inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same is the case with long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company was a brilliant application to talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a different choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for 30 years; she was currently the sales, marketing and development director.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations occur.
No wonder many ideas work around half a million people in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor Harvard Business School Economist and author of the book on IBM Rosebet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added Joge Koloni from Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In one hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company, which develops equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnologies.
It has the highest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of which have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial hub, a strike code and a floppy.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second technology company ( Apple's first place) this year, when Microsoft was released for the first time since 1996.
Look forward to it.
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy's online service and computers IBM PCjr.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM is easily based on several platforms -- if they don't work, she's giving up.
This differs, for example, from your Microsoft competitor, who is based and experiences falling on Windows, his operating system.
Perspective technology
Main IBM revenues are derived from services, about one fifth in each case from computer programs and hardware.
As in 1990, with a capital of less than two, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in forward-looking technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until now, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate currency of IBM is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis occurred, this flexible giant will face the situation.
History IBM: from the raw knife to space flying.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its initial title “Computation, Tabulation, Records” was rather complex.
She took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by a merger of four companies whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technology, such as the legendary “table hours”, that is, fixed hours when staff came and left work.
The new company's architect was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also headed the company's Board of Trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the director of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then turned the founder of IBM into a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of a fragile corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, began from the production and sale of various equipment for the business - from raw knives and cuts to cash machines.
In the first four years, Watson's leadership doubled to $9 million, and the company's expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later, his seat in the chair of the director took his son, Thomas Watson.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In 1960, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA control space flights -- on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 -- human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers from the Chinese company Lenovo, while at the same time buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing fully on consulting and services with high added value.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of trade, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps business to control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ is also running a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research team is also working on speech recognition.
Richtarja about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, be stupid, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarjov (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošova (45), Darina still hoped that he would start and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has made clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtarjov explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided her home with the blood of Bartošova, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she had Yvette leave Rzychan 30 days later, Peppa didn't leave the song.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretended to calm down with her husband's novel; and now she's finally forgiven him.
I don't care who's sleeping with his wife.
Even if Richtarge and Bartoshaw ever split up, his wife won't take him out with widespread hugs.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him away."
"At the same time he will end his days not like my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am bound," said Richtarjov, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on the perfidious appearances.
While Joseph had nothing to do with his wife’s rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for the repair, garden, home and shopping."
"Darina and I are perfectly normal, only we don't share a bed anymore," Richtarz told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarj finds a new love, he won't interfere with it.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I bear full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worse women's habits: Do they concern you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Ladies and gentlemen, are you familiar with the following lines that describe some of the women’s habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains you're always going to the shops?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
Yet which of you will give up a walk in the marketplaces in search of an ideally seated garment and an example of it (wanted, in various colors) in a sample?
Maybe shopping and it's a hobby for most women, but for men it can be an essential hell.
Just remember how many times you said your second half to wait for you outside...
Eternal Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five pounds -- maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still coming to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women involved in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men have, in a literal sense, an allergy to the constant complaints of their partners in their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more complaints occur, the more women upset them.
The most important order and purity
It's like an endless story.
Glass beakers, dust cleaners, sex beakers, dusters, bath cleaners, at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for coming up for a clean coffee in dirty shoes; the children for the dirt in clean rags and fingerprints on the window glass in the hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “deviation, ” try to realize that it is extremely bad; and that your family should not be in the first place.
A sincere desire to be clean may threaten your relationship as well as your family.
Motivated by Command
"Put your clothes in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty legs tomorrow?"
"The wet cloth for the dish should not be on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find this very necessary.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Web
Some women enjoy flirting, insulting and slandering others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, how, and why.
From time to time, it is likely that each of us will break free.
Let's be frank, such a visible nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious Internet sites, women who are often networked and despised by others, and they, especially in the women's working community, pose a major risk to their environment.
The resulting transfers of Yagra and Voraceka helped the Philadelphias to win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of the hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped the Philadelphias win 5:3 on the ice of Karolina.
In both cases, Claude Giru used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to the player in one team with Jagor Yacubu Voracek.
After the match, Yagr told the foreign journalists that he had predicted to the jury a wonderful evening.
"I told him before the match that he'd kill the hettrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jagr, after whose actions Giru killed the target at the first opportunity given by Flyers.
Shortly after the second goal, the teams also had a "Czech track".
The locker Harrikinz Voracek captured the arrow and handed it over to Max Talbot, who killed it between the circles.
In a second until the first break of the home game, Patrick Dwiver reduced the gap in a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second team, Fleyers again took it.
Especially the jury.
After giving Yagra the result, he killed the third target; his hit was subsequently turned into the fourth target by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best game of the league, but he's exactly part of the three best," said Jagger, commending his central.
"I never thought I'd play a hockey game like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routu and the Deweyer Penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who raised the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the trigger, I hurried, and Reed moved to the far end."
"I was so pleased with him that it worked," said Voracek, describing his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory led Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Chech Yaroslav Spacek team did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to the injury to the upper part of the body.
Along with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomash Plekanec couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than the lost sights, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with all five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement was devastating, and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the arrow out of our area."
"What was on our weak side," added the defendant P.K.Subban
After the 30th attack on the Czech hyperbole, Onjay Paveletz helped Winnipeg win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets ’ goals, which ended the five-month series of defeats, were killed by five different games.
Price dynamics on travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Soci, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The main paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation from that country was necessary; another individual travel was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to either stand up all night, with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency was required for travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without a currency authorization it was impossible to obtain the money (western currency) to travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs have held their vacations at home, which has resulted in a large number of cottages and summer homes, and this practice remains today.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the present revolution.
While before 1989, leave in GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs conducted 4.5 million leave in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that by 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia at present because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe was lifted, which led to a huge wave of short trips mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Chechoslovakis couldn't take any trips to the West, they all wanted to go there for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income at the time did not catch up with the hotel or the pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conservations, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After a decade, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income have grown, which has led to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourist agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines, and compared to the past, airlines have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of post-revolution travel took place in 2000 and led to a historic first direct charter trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country of Thailand.
Since then, direct charter trips have been carried by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take 12 exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs are visiting exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for visas for Czech tourists, so our country has always joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history they spent over 15,000 kroner per person during their vacation abroad, including their expenses in the destination paragraph.
The General Assembly must elect the President, the danger of the return of the journey
For about five months, there was no president in Czech football, and there was a risk that the successor of Ivan Gašek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) would not be called even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no consensus on what electoral rules to follow.
Without that vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindzhih Reichle, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Pazlik want to lead Czech football.
Gašek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, Gašek's era re-embarked football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when a new President had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smileov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly, either legal representatives or also officials who had been authorized.
This moment has since been partially resolved through the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that a delegation based on the powers conferred is not possible.
Disputes concerning electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board is also not too helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly a matter of concern.
The representations of voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round 3 and avoid the road?
“The issue is whether to follow the standards or find another model,” says one of the Vice-Presidents of FACHR Dushan Freeboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
On the basis of the model provided for in the Charter, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree with the compromise - to be the winner of the candidate ' s election with the highest number of the total number of voters in the two chambers.
The Czech side insists that the winner should receive at least two thirds of the votes in the overall percentage.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their sense; this would completely deny the concept of two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments.
A few surprises, Tomash Pazlik agrees with his opinion, although according to the electoral rules established by the statute, Peltu is more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go as far as possible through the Charter."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," says Victoria Plzeň, who is the first candidate; and in his statements he essentially contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new president would become known in Nymburg; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotion will calm down after today's expected national rally at the European Championship."
“Football will be happy again, people will be more willing to cooperate,” says the representative of Jablonec, who has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's tighter.
"I'm hoping for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the rules intentionally."
"It could cause another general assembly to break."
"I hope a healthy sense will win," said Rachel.
There was not much time left for the parties to reach agreements.
It is reported that some negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether a football match will be achieved.
An additional trip, which was to be made, among other things, by the Vice-Chairmen of Dalibor Kucheru and Reichla to Podgorica, did not leave Prague this morning because of technical failure, seeking an alternative to bring part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the re-playing match.
At the end of the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opposition parties to the country ' s strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot on the map: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pazlik enters the presidential struggle because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzeň Tomas Pazlik, saw a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements to the President of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not take part in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik ČTK.
The Paclik motive for fighting Miroslav Pelty and Yindzhi Ryhl is to try to prevent Pelte, who is supposed to be the favourite of the elections, from entering the FAČR.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that in the event of victory, he will remain President only until 2013 when a regular general meeting is planned.
In the future, he would like this position to be occupied by an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football life.
"I've talked to a few people that could be meant."
"I was terrified to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Paclica and Peltai is related to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbrom, the president of the Pulsen Regional Football Association. Berbr is a man of conflicting reputation who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the votes of the delegates of the universal assembly.
Pazlik thus considered it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," Paclik said.
He points out that a few years ago Pelta ' s name was written in the hearing of the telephones in an investigation into the corruption case; Pelta ' s sentence was avoided.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlik.
If Pazlik won on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general meeting in September, after the fiasco had ended.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to come to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the collection."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have my nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the judge's brigade, led by the Man of the Macello, whom Dagmar Damkov changed.
Pazlik claims that he will risk managing the association.
He referred to his private company management experience; last summer he was led by a team of Plzeň, who, with his help, celebrated his first victory in the League in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change and support its changes for the better."
“Limit the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, which leads to ostracism,” Pazlik said.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he will lobby at the highest political level for the allocation of more money to sport from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points to be addressed by the new President."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money goes," he said.
Pazlik does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň Club to be a burden, although he claims that the President of FACHR should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the Appleonc, and Rachel is connected to the Prague Dock.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else at the Plzeň Club when I'm going back there six months later," Pazlik says.
Pelta has promised new FACHR rules that will prevent the election path
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new FACHR rules in order to avoid future dispute over election rules.
Before Thursday ' s negotiations in Nimburg, the official of Jablonec remains optimistic and believes that the emphasis on the pre-election struggle will be felt by today ' s expected success of our football rally.
Prior to the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment prior to the last general meeting, and a two-month delay could thus have been useful to him to support his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been at football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is time for someone to lead the association right now,” claims the person, mainly associated with the Apple Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believed that the current problems were caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gašek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the joint assembly in June."
"If different forms of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president by September," Pelta said.
It refers to the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false objective for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will assume my personal responsibility if this attempt proves to be a failure."
"This is a fundamental issue that we cannot exist without," says Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to separate himself from the rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindzi Reichh, whom he valued for legal education; he fully recognized the fact that his opponent had to become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paclik, who constantly criticized Peltu.
"He's been in football for years and he's achieved some success."
"Whatever the case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were amazed at his campaign."
"Even so, some of them now have doubts about his true personality," said Pelta about her rival.
He considered his main weapons knowledge of football, from low-level competitions to national assembly.
The national collection must represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Goddess case or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
“I would immediately focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football,” the forty-six-year-old candidate said to the ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football leader would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'm going to need to know the official instructions of individual staff." That was his message to Insurance, where the extended period of inter-government causes a sense of nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that on Thursday delegates would not come to Nimburg empty.
"If the only issue is how to make a third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the confidence he can gain by choosing the end of his leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic for two days until the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that under his leadership, FACHR will become active
If the meeting on Thursday of the Yindzi Reichle, acting Vice-President, became President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association would be disgruntled.
Rachel promises that if they choose him, there will be a time of hard work.
He wanted to introduce changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promised to address the problem of the gods; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of former President Ivan Gašek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national collecting, professional football and youth football activities”.
"That's why I don't want to say that I'm going to do it myself," Rachel said in her interview with the ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to allocate authority to the Executive Committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments the football takes great steps forward."
"It probably won't like many people because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any sense in it; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks into my wheels and doubt every step of my life," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"That trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to go through all this."
“There have been processes that can produce results a few years ago, and I do not want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelt, was elected, the situation in the Association might return to what was before Gašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what is hardly competent to Mirek Pelt."
"He's surrounded by people who do football in such a way that he's only accessible to the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot, but it's not about subjectiveness anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denies that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim otherwise, I plan to make the most of it for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While Plzen Tomash Pazlik, the manager of the Plzen Pazlik, entered the presidential battle, Rachel did not dare to assess his chances of victory.
“However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious achievements,” said Rachel. He is concerned with the economy of tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the Lotteries Act.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for the lack of unity in the association.
Admitting that Pelta was "out of the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another opponent, Pazlica, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be spoiling facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about her rival.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Drain in the water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try the incredible water of Europe - and relax the constitutional body in the Jacuzzi after a tour of the city or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder was unable to travel during her research journeys for the last half year: without her bathing suit.
She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the well-shaped dome, swimming at the marbled cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool and loving carefully restored swimming pools in the Ar-New style.
She hesitated to add each popular swimming pool to her notebook - with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The history of Meder's architecture has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now collected impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) where everything went, from public pools in Munich to historical shopping castles in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the current enthusiast of the culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in the water everything is different.
The only defect is that the swimmers must cope with the blue coffee plate and the smell of chlorine, while the fugitives can breathe the enigma of pine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and the oil that has been found in the sauna is a health factor in the bathrooms because Meader believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a pleasure to see if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the sex in the pool you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visible: high ceilings, colored tiles and tramplings.
The illustrated 190 - page “Beautiful bathing” edition contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health - and it is your desire to get into the water.
The watertight collector Meder found several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
She found rich nitrates of water in the karst cave (Miškoltz-Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bath filled with potable water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasbarne), as well as magnificent therapeutic bathrooms such as 100-year-old Seceni in Budapest.
From many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see all Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony and there is a window in the parlour that allows you to see what is happening in the pool.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits bathers in Langenfeld.
Its winter rises from a pair of three open crabs, which appear to be quite small in the background of the Ectal mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzwalde
The Meder pool collection did not meet the smell of chlorine in each pool.
Many thermal bathrooms will smell a lot, and the bathroom names of Arpad in Bekeshchab will smell oil so much that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in the cup water. Water is almost black from a dish that adheres to the skin as soon as you land in the pool - a healthy experience of a particular type.
However, at some point, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit an open Czech swimming pool in Lugačović, she discovered that the territory had been sealed.
The bathrooms designed by the architect Dushan Jurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked out of a red-and-white building window in the style of an Ar-Nuvo, she saw the cracks growing between the coffee plates.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot spots is a wonderful swimming pool in Schwarzwald, a thermal water station in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra-style hall, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of the Ayris Meder - and not just because it was born from Schwarzwald.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine such different architectural styles," Meder says.
To dive into a thermal pool in such a castle is a clearly secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
Daughter Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Titus
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann commissioned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of German citizens find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents require Deutsche Bank and other banks to stop trade in agricultural products, as trade is exacerbating the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, demonstrates that the world commodity stock market is playing a major role in rising prices - and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Saks and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
The commodity rates were originally designed as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that the players have rejected the rules of supply and demand - and are being used by the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or stopped altogether.
Akkerman's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “The growing food prices are an example of how reckless banks are currently acting against common interests.”
As Ackermann's chief lobbyist has a certain duty, Bode believes.
"The House Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Akkermann's immediate reaction was initially surprising, but in the meantime the Director would like to have a clear picture just a few months before his stay in the office ended.
Daughter Bank announced on Monday that the president would not go to the observer board as planned.
The elimination of the dispute of speculation on the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he need to worry about the costs - with consequences his successor will have to deal with.
Each other would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of the Force on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments at the food price are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade, and according to the study, each of them would withdraw contributions that ultimately lead to product speculation.
43 per cent would recommend getting out of the bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st-century house in Vienna
The Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history with flights, falls and happy endings. Austria’s Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won awards, became a museum in Vienna, was abandoned and deserted.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, which expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won Gran Pri in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass milling.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria ' s pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
At the end of 1973, he celebrated the whole world his legendary four - cylinder BMW and her sister, a glass - shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden around the South Waxal of Vienna, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th century" for this reason.
However, the building did not approach the museum for technical and spatial reasons; it did not have walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krišanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is an office of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a joyful event.
Agnes Hussleyn-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Hussleyn-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant youth figure's career at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guardians to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum had to include a permanent exhibition of Fritz Votruba, coffee and a bookstore along with contemporary art, and an office building had to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krišanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session of Joseph Olbrich, and he won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was for him “an extremely important place”, where he visited the exhibitions “almost every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks ahead of the building, which had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and converted.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a reinforced glass-resistant glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-resistant safety glass.
The steel translations of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the roof.
Two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, the light source between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were kept and the building was decorated in an old red-brown color protection against corrosion.
Hall cinema is the same as it was before.
All of this is under strict control of the museum administration and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum administration," says Krisanitz, pointing to an uneven style in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite restrictions, problems and conversions.
Krishanitz recently noted that the Brussels pavilion was rough - a typical history of the droplets in the city.
Such architecture is “not always in its place” and nevertheless wants to “stimulate this awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, as the city's planning has led to unexpected success. A completely rebuilt "quarter of the main station" with offices and residential property is growing around Switzerland now.
The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Krišanitz, the collector of Francesca von Gabsburg acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city on its location in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million-dollar anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of winter trains.
The number of staff must be increased by two.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal anti-crisis plan, Bildt reports that investments are planned to amount to around €300 million by 2015.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and staff involved in the treatment of snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice until work begins and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of the cancellation and delays of this winter ' s trains at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties in passenger transport because it did not catch up when the weather was deteriorating.
Many new regional trains of the year were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in ICE train delivery.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axes much more frequently over the years after one of the ICE trains broke down at the main station in Kelna.
Daughter Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fines in the United States
New troubles followed the concerns of Joseph Ackermann, Director General of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is threatening the US fine in many millions of pounds of sterling.
The Dutch Bank had little family problems, the last industrial giant in the U.S. now pushed him. The Dutch Bank with headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle the disputes that occurred after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of five major credit unions.
There was a problem with the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of the bonds dropped sharply during the financial crisis and lowered the credit unions.
"We are pleased to have solved this problem without referring the parties to the court," said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA), is responsible for the United States credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that come from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and launched a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtable mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage credit pool securities.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This has led to the fate of a number of financial companies when, in 2007, a boom in the US real estate market.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 for the financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting a storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Funding Agency (FHFA) is the most demanding claim.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having acquired US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's pledges of approximately $200 billion.
The Bank's daughter is also facing the threat of prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements of a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the Frankfurt headquarters bank assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank's daughter rejected the claims as unfounded and reported an intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's Financial Guru invests actively in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares in total of more than ten billion dollars.
The largest American investor Warren Buffet has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM ' s annual report changed its view on investment in the sector.
According to Buffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was valued as a knightly act.
IBM, an IT vet, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. business channel CNBC Buffet, he reported that he had acquired IBM shares from March on to a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said even IBM had no knowledge of his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that was able to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffet, referring to a management strategy.
A significant time IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been offered for over 100 years now, also offers software and advisory services as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet's been running away from technology companies so far.
He claimed to invest only in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the manufacture of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway is owned by shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rüg), together with about 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the most expensive companies in the world with the help of skilled investment.
But he remained modest.
made it a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable money instinct brought him the name Oracula from Omaha.
The price of IBM shares rose by one per cent prior to the opening of the markets after the Buffet investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is still called, is worth over $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Unmindful danger
After the detection of "sacres in Zwickau", the Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of “blood ideology”, which is now being raised again to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a legal extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been the response to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-lost fears. Such right-wing attacks on Turks have not since been carried out in Mellen in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but there has been xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network currently found has an extent that is not yet fully understood.
"Rebirth of blood ideology?" was the title of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah notes, on the other hand, that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities might be involved in the law-extremist nightmare.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by mentioning the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket against the Brandenburg Gates in these outlets.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
In some Turkish media, lighting was like a bribe. "The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Haber X web site, which comments on the murder series.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not allow this parallel to be carried out.
"It smells bad" is the name of Ahmet Kulakhji's column.
He noted that people who had paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany had been killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful occupation were severely criticized by the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before about monitoring suspects in the right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather strict rhetoric: "If they continue to do the same inconsistencies, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves."
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be opened and on the legality of the punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellen and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burnt ruins in Zolingen was deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other incident has shown to the Turks here so clearly that they are in danger and to the Germans that mistrust and equality can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do Not Repeat Previous Error
At that time, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Mellen.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but his participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelne was attended by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, in his speech, counted the taxes the Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he determined the value of the person by the taxes that he pays.
The current lighting in the Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German State has deepened since then.
He made it clear that efforts should now be made to identify and reassess the right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal in Lake Zurich
Most of the European banks' policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has hardly been able to cope with the financial crisis, and since then it has been constantly fighting one crisis or the other.
Now it is up to the Germans to return it to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect that he was going to play this role.
In July, following his effective resignation from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work on a no less effective position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Major Bank UBS; unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly in the woods, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its regained strength, and made some friendly comments on behalf of his future colleagues.
"UBS has changed for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London went through the bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of UBS has been considered sick and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Webber finally come to his post?
Weber should consult a bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, it will take office as President of the Council in May, not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Webber.
He is an economic professor and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he will definitely need time to adapt.
He was secondly responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently it has managed the largest assets in the world - and, on the other, is not out of the scandals.
The proud Swiss bank seems to be saving nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank united the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time the asset manager with ambitions and a desire to become the biggest player in the investment bank.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more cash than any other bank in the world,
and entered into the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, who has been teaching at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains, "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could have made such a mistake."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffly, who was considered to be an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a shining banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The Bank ' s investment unit tried to play on substandard securities and had to write billions.
You want to believe you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to withstand the crisis.
The Bank was indeed able to find investors - but investors, many of whom had recently been reluctant to provide services - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, so hidden that even its name had not been reported.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to declare new billion losses, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospell, the second at the salary level of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster occurred, which resulted from the lack of investment in the UBS financial crisis, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has bought UBS toxic precious paper for an unprecedented number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with compulsory conversion to become the bank ' s co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of large banks in the small country.
At the end of 2007, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times more than all of Switzerland ' s production (see chart).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred soon after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and said that he was willing to transfer the data from state-owned clients who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million in compensation for unwarranted business income plus fine.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost that it always had its advantage in fighting for rich clients, a secretive curtain.
After that, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's money came out.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activity, investing in unsuccessful speculation and asset management as a result of assistance and promotion of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it turned out that UBS was able to break down the situation of the accident with a trader, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed something wrong in the bank.
It is clear that risk management in the investment office is not yet operational.
"Adobolly's incident has clearly shown that the risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also not doubtful: “The UBS problem is that it does not have a risk control tool”.
It was the long-term caution that Swiss bankers had been keeping the world ' s largest assets -- not too risky, but safe for money, whether or not the world had broken down outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of unmistakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, just a little more.
Her mood is just a classic.
The main bank office is located in Zurich, in Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, in the area of the snow hats of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are bright and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops of the type Confiserie Sprüngli here you can find such jewelry companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been present here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Kredi Suisse Palace and the elite private banks, such as Julius Bear.
The heavy door leads to the UBS West.
Along the walls covered with marble, there's a lot of strange leather, and the bank's emblem is marked with a large "Sif".
UBS knows what his clients need, security.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point they gave up Swiss ideas about the bank case - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks thinks, they betrayed them.
He would not want to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with two of the largest banks.
He believed that UBS had become too large, in particular in an investment bank where Anglo-Saxons were very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if anything, they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, brought him the first big gains - and then failed. No other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became evident on 15 October 2008.
"In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the country's history," says Lucas Hessig in his book Crah UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped to complement the two banks that formed UBS. One was a rich but gradual bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
International investment banks suddenly got access to a large amount of money they could use to turn the all-powerful wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ospell were a team of dreamers," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, who excels intellectually, humble and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospell with his inner instinct, who went all the way up, starting with an intern in the bank."
But Ospell finally went to Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," said Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
The UBS ministers well remember the meetings of the members of the government, at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan, to call Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was headed by the “touring table” where the success of the banks had been achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make some of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in the trade of currency and public securities.
The senior management consultants, however, indicated a weak position, which in banking terminology is called “permanent income”, was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in US mortgage products.
To shut the door, UBS joined an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In an attempt to grow, the bank itself and its underlying hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This was developed in a large mechanism that combined securities based on US mortgages and sold them further, continuing to bear risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was already in fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to leave as the attempts to bring the bank in order were more difficult than seemed at first.
Posts in UBS have become a child's game with chairs and remain hopeless to this day.
Anyone who will take the lead in this huge bank is almost impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that's back to all existing business models.
Gaeger's banking analysis already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
Bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly narrowed.
The new head of Sergio Ermotti plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he was able to show the nature and now, as the Turkish bank said on Tuesday, he is headed by UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which he was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.

Fears of recession in Europe draw down the American Stock Exchange
The rising recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of US investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The downturn in industrial production on the continent has blinded the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome at birth.
The general relief followed by changes of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been supported.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the front," said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were listed.
The industrial Dow Jones index was closed at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer during trade fluctuates between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading 2657 items.
Frankfurt Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 countries has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September companies accounted for two per cent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on the island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe could hardly quickly narrow down the recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was only able to confirm these fears, and in an interview with CNBC he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European public bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a ten-year-old principle into the trash bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to over $10 billion in the course of the sale of the stock price of this older company almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares are closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffet said he had paid an average of $170 per share and now has a share of 5.5 per cent.
The stock price of its investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The Bank has converted almost all remaining parts of the Chinese Building Bank into cash, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank is primarily planning to support its share of net sales income in order to comply with stricter rules.
The Boing aircraft manufacturer won, reducing Dow-Jones losses.
The price of shares rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation had received the largest order in its history.
The air carrier Emirates ordered a total cost of $18 billion for 50 long-distance aircraft 777.

Approximately 710 million shares were transferred to the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies grew, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.

Immediate heroes fill the city
The players are considered problematic birds in many places, and experts say today that these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of the city.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but people who complain about noise and noise are becoming more and more populous in many places.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been addressed.
At the first hero symposium, experts in the city of Lear in East Frisian said that the player could no longer be removed from the city.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected toys, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitat areas.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees have made life difficult for birds.
The crows are protected.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-west in the North, Dipholce, Achim under Bremen and Lere there are large colonies of more than 600 parents.
The multifaceted project of shooting ravens in Lere caused unacceptable newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the catch of birds in hunting and the killing of them with sticks as special cruelty.
"Ordinarily moved and scared nothing" said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clever from Lear.
The collapse of the stream of water or the rubble of trees has often had adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animal spreads, and large colonies divide and spread across other areas”.
Disassociation may be possible only in the form of exclusion from hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them, and getting rid of them is no option."
The problem in cities will not be solved apart from the surrounding areas, says Mayor Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of the fear of birds from the need to protect and encourage them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stands instead of benzopils" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Utah Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational front route in Asherberg, Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands provide information on the lives of very intelligent players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion on the noise complaints made by the birds, "The noise transmits a lot of information, they have to tell each other a lot."
The mind and muzzle of these birds have entered the legends, and players often use not only the weapon to control their eyes, but also the weapon themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently protested the measure of bird mind in four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to jump on the board to get a mole.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to destroy the child.
In another experiment, a more complex task had to be solved for match players.
The researchers placed a small molybdenum in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a log.
But the researchers gave them pieces of lead.
All four birds took advantage of the shell to make the wings and use the wings to tie the windshield behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done this since the first attempt.
Ronaldu takes Portugal to Euro-2012
The hope of Bosniaks and Turks for victory in the last minute has not been maintained for a long time.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last seats in the Euro-2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the superstar Christian Ronald, who killed for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with an account of 6:2 (2:1), perfectly designed its fifth exit to Euro after 0:0 in the first phase.
Czechham was enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round to play off against Montenegro's outside after a pure victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance, played 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velozou (80th) killed the rest of the goals for Portugal.
The former Bundesligi professional player from Wolfsburg, Zvezdan Missimovic and Captain Emir Spahic reduced the difference between two points due to an effective 41-minute penalty and a 65-minute goal for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a second yellow card at 54th minute.
Portugal had already kicked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal has made an excellent start at the Lisbon Stadium da Lus.
Ronaldo took an early start with a free kick in the door at about 30 meters.
Ninety-four hours later, Nani demonstrated his long-term capabilities, with a 25-metre score of up to 2:0.
Bosniaks, who did not open the account at the first half of the day, were given their first opportunity because of the attacker Edina Jacko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the English champion Manchester City at the 33th minute sent a head ball to the lower end of the stall, but the ball did not cross the line of the door.
Iraqek is killing for the Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the center of attention.
After an attack on Elder Postigu in the Bosnian penal court at the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese game was simulating and showing him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced the dubious penalty for playing by hand after Fabiu Quantran-Misimovich had implemented it.
After the break of the 2004 European Vice-Campion, the account was sealed with four more holes.
Peter Iraček has released all the remaining doubts about checks at the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are on the European Championship for the fifth time in order.
The success also came from the team of coach Michael Bilek and the legionaries of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlez (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could become catastrophic.
At the 9th minute, Petr Chech, thanks to the instantaneous reflex, prevented the potential autogol of Tomash Sivok.
The best chances were that Montenegro had a duet of Steven Jovetic and Dean Damianovich on the field.
Damianovic took a 40-minute hit from the end of the police station and barely killed the target of the Czech.
After the break of the barn, the already rocked Czech World Cup player was saved after F.C. Seoul left the field at the 50th minute.
The winner was killed just before the final whistle.
At the time, Turkey did not enjoy football.
Four days after the victory of 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks couldn't play better than killing 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is virtually no doubt that the coach of the Gus Hiddink Congregation will now release the team on the platform from third place in 2002, the Croatians are the fourth in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks have been able to launch 31,000 spectators at Maximir.
Seldjuk Annan's long hit at seven o'clock and the attacker of Kazim Kazim was unable to pull the ball off the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the Croatian break, the game continued in excellent form.
The legionaries of the Bundesligi Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field together with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who took place Ivan Perishic from Dortmund at 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is coming to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first entry to the Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Jovanny Trapattoni's team, who already looked confident in his place after the 4th phase of victory, took the lead at 32 minutes thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasilev of the guest team compared the account at 57th minute.
Ireland took a good turn from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean head hit.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender could not allow it to move Ireland forward.
The target was killed at 32 minutes.
As Paul Londak's bulwark was protected, Ward was in the right place and, by playing the ball across the line, changed the account to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its number in China over the next few years.
The Dax Listing company announced on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars by 2015 (about 1.5 billion euros).
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people," Bill McDermott, an executive director of the SAP, said in his statement at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The state of 2500 people must grow to 4,500.
The world leader of the industrial software market plans to double the number of offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chendu and Daljan.
There are about 4,000 SAP customers in this country from over 176,000 worldwide.

"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
A tense and very good new book by Peter Englund, "Crawling and Grief: Personal History of World War I", begins with a long list of the people from whom the heart is dying.
Here is the advice to read on: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very close as Mr. Anglond tells you, and this list of active people will be your GPS, your faggot, when, like one of these men and women, you'll get out of the way and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Anglund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as an anti-history work.
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, hunters or discussions of tactics and martial arts.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains how much "book about what it looked like."
The book Crasto and Grief shared the experiences of the war years of 20 more or less un notable men and women from both sides of the front line, from school and botanists to alpineists, doctors, ambulance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into captivity, loses his hand or his foot, comes out of mind or dies.
Their lives are viewed here as church candles: new candles are added to many others, and some will be extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englind's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the idea that World War I was only a heavy war in the West Front.
"Grace and sorrow" is a gift to other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book, the soldiers fall to bee oils; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the flies of the whale.
It's an interesting book, almost from the very beginning.
War covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which smells like smokeless dust.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, you're gonna stay or you're gonna get away?
Anyway, who's doing this?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and listening."
The beauty and sorrow follow the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German Navy sailor.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters, and other material already published.
The stories of their lives may be horrendous or fascinating, but they are mostly alive through the small moments and the fragmentary details gathered by Mr. Anglond.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the history of the German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, where are you going?"
"The coffee maker, the aluminium alloy, the non-existent cut, the paper binders, the wood pudding."
He continues to talk about grassroots in Germany.
It describes "the meat of pressed rice burned in a barrel of fat (and decorated with false bone made from wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; shoe covered with wood".
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes authorized for sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes”.
Some stories tell about honor and courage.
One American notes his own passion for cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or bestsellers, and to claim that this show and there is civilization and under your garbed shirt there is no barbar."
On the contrary, the British soldier notes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person is content with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that this will happen before the public," he writes.
But on the contrary, it's like a "condemned man hanging out in secret."
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is falling apart, and to new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become more and more economical," writes Mr. Englund, "a war plant."
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-dressed suit that creates a cut, sitting behind a writing table."
People act in an unpredictable way: low behaviors as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told me about the soldiers who were trying to get rid of the prostitutes of the venereal disease in order to avoid service on the front.
“The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of genorrhea, which soldiers bought and chewed on the genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
"The despairing ones have caught his eye, which has often led to life's blindness."
Translated with Swedish Peter Gravez, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but nebroic, which is perfectly suited for his humanitarian task.
In dozens of small scenes he shows how the war “released totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The better books on World War I were often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fasselle or by novels such as "On the Western Front Without Change" by Erika-Marie Remark, not by extenuating historical works.
Mr. Englind's book is part of this untempered pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale that I can recall in unscrupulous literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it was as if he came from the book to the page with a list of characters, caught it from your hands and burned it with a spear.
After the previous error, a carefully calculated read
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there must have been fewer people in Zukotti Park at the time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said they were going to school.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the events, and his presence emphasized the importance of the Department of Police operations.
There could be no recurrence of such episodes in recent weeks as the use of flue gas against protesters, which violated the Department ' s rules and caused a hurricane of public sympathy with the occupations.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to get rid of the protesting Zukotti Park.
The authorities prepared to observe the unfolding of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on the island of Randels, calculated at Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures that involve the rapid movement of a large number of police - including Lower Manhattan.
The final training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came in "the last minute" - a source that was familiar with the orders in which the task was referred to as "training".
"Those few cops that I know and that I've called for didn't say they're being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke under the terms of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that had been taught by the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but they withdrew from hundreds of protestors, who had flocked within the time frame, to hear about these plans.
In the operation on Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including police forces from the districts, were involved, which were usually used to control the criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as busy as they are, come and leave the park during the day, which makes one hour of the night a suitable time for arrival.
"It was right to do this when there were fewer people in the park," he said.
Rescue machines with transmitters and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The projector and the pre-recorded announcements made by the thunderstormers seem to have frightened many protestors.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the tents had not been touched until 1:45 p.m., giving the protesting time to gather things.
Other police groups, at the testimony of the witnesses, gathered on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see the police and that the police have treated them cruelly.
Mr. Brown said that cameras on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protestors, including bags, plastic envelopes and polyethylene bags, full clothing, the Department of Health ' s teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown away.
Some protestors who refused to leave have been taken out, and these photos soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took positions next to the kitchen camp at the center of the park.
Some have built barricades, and the police have entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp epicenter were shaking their hands together.
And two men stuck to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
To cut the locks, rescue officers were called.
No arrests were held in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed in about 75 minutes, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority was arrested for “a violation of public order and resistance to detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer of the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's reach police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "has not managed the operation," Mr. Brown said.
The second group of police was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
The fences were placed on the Cortland Street, in a quarter north of the park, and on Pine Street, in a quarter south.
Observers have seen police from these positions expand the perimeter even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, draw people further.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped to the roof of the police car, while others said that they had air from the police van.
At some point, the crowd flew a bit of a flashlight.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The union of staff serving schools will be sent to the city court for dismissal
The trade union, representing hundreds of staff serving schools who lost seats last month, plans to bring the city to court on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students were taught.
The trial is probably the last means available to the trade union of the District Council 37 to try to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, coordinator of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling their refusal to grant access to medical funds managed by the working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials have categorically rejected the charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, the school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board was in a row, telling him that there was nowhere in the budget any indication that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the 37 district council reported that they had filed a complaint by warning the Department of Education that they had filed a complaint against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal submission of an application to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Wolcott and the Department of Urban Education will be identified as respondents and eight temporary firemen will be listed as claimants, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the New York Times complaint, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor urban areas to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while Staten Island did not have a dismissal, and there were few schools in the Upper East Side or Tribeca, 17 school supporters lost seats in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim says: “These are not areas of permanent parents who can find money to fill the budget gaps”.
P.S. 36 budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student entering school.
The trade union also claims that the Director of Schools could be misled by the language of a notification authorising the dismissal of coordinators from work with parents.
The notice used the word “exceeding”, although the word “exceeding” was more often used when the teacher from the school payroll moved to the list of existing employees paid by the central office.
" Sixty-six focal points for working with parents have been fired," says the claim, "not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is ready for the Libya Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capital Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the resurrection in Libya.
All it took was for the riot to succeed, the former dictator Muamar Kaddafi was arrested and killed, and the U.S. intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democratic, Massachusetts), along with senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praised the Libyans for their successful uprising and the American troops for their courage.
“The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations by both parties."
The language may prove harmless, but no other discussion about Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKain presented a resolution allowing limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the votes of both parties and did not vote in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the bill had failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support the proposal to cut off the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This has left the American mission in some kind of legislature -- when Congress is upset enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad to actually kick the ground out of her feet.
The events then led to the insolventness of the Congress
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for its extraordinary courage and extraordinary persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners, who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council or split up legislators, as a June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republicans in the Committee, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives this week should vote for the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Gudlat (Republican, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or on something else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of that call.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they had not tried.
The Gudlata amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues raised in this context.
Some have doubled - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - and others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “Federal expenditure control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mainly the newly elected Republicans, the opportunity to boast that they have made such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, called for the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of the balanced budget amendment.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress and a member of the House of Representatives of José Serrano (Democrat, New York) wishes to abolish the time limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, a young (Democratic, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment banning single-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another banning flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states oppose them.
No matter how eager the members of the Congress have been to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
At the 111th assembly of the Congress, 77 such amendments were proposed by the legislators and 66 were introduced by the 110th.
This rate will be measured compared with the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success has not been greater than it is now.
The last amendment that was adopted - 27 - was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced at Congress in 1789.
"Flight, but not won," said Giffords in his first television interview after the temptation
Ten months after the armed man shot at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday evening, sang a melody from the Broadway Show "The Sun Will Come Back Tomorrow" and said he wanted more to heal than to return to Congress.
Having appeared on the 20/20 A-by News program with Diana Sawyer, Giffords worked hard to formulate proposals and needed help in walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover after the trauma caused by the bullet that broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the draft limitation bill.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang, and called her recovery “hard”.
Asking Sawyer how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special edition of 20/20, which was shown before the release of the new book by Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The Special Edition reported on the restoration of the Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On the video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital couch with a bright head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see the giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and the physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Keep your head down.
Get your mouth out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, if Geoffrey spoke the second word, "toast," please change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by Ey-bi shows that music played a central role in the healing of the Giffords: we see a congressman singing together with the doctors "The Girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spent two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of temptation.
Her husband told me he was reading the Giffords article in the March 12th shooting newspaper when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected attacker Jard Lee Lafner is in prison in Missouri and is being treated in a forced manner pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
Hard, hard, hard.
Once during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm over."
"And I said, 'Ebby, you're not defeated,' said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you'll get through it, you'll recover and you'll be back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a Wall Street celebration that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock was playing a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marine pedestrians were on the alert.
The tuxedo cheered him up.
"The soldiers looked like heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized a spring fundraiser.
Senior military officer at the concert, at which he was also then chaired by the Chief of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the military in another.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
Perfectly opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the army and the often equal, sometimes admired, American public.
Soldiers pay tribute to their victims.
But praise is their price, the soldiers say.
The public is becoming more and more like a pitiful person.
"We are not the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who has command of troops in Iraq and is soon to go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to address us as unfortunate."
This is a sensitive theme for soldiers who do not want to be ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by the returning armies in the recent years of the war in Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on grief take place quietly and only between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat in the seabed, the retired Colonel Mark Kenshan warned them that non-military people would view their service from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they have baffled the rebels and used to be in exotic places.
Others will wonder if he is hiding under a “mass cruel veteran”, said Kenshan, who fought in Iraq and when he returned, took a high government position in Washington.
As he looked for work, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers were asking carefully whether he could withstand the tension of responsible work in Washington right after the war came.
Kenshan remembers saying to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to rely on a negative effect."
The insecurity experienced by the war is partly due to American indifference to war.
Victory in the field of war is rarely praised by a country that is little known to the army and has little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was in the Second World War," says Lieutenant General David Bernow, who was in charge of US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is focused mainly on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops estimate the number of profits they have earned, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, a decision should be made on whether 28 men and women would be charged against the army for non-violence.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be equipped with the following.
The first class of Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and at 11 weeks of pregnancy, according to her claim, was raped by her servant at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another and met a male servant with a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But the harvester Texas refused her fears.
I thought: No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came behind her, knocked and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eager to await the court's decision at a historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, and to decide whether or not they will go to court against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by counsel Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 claimants, but grew up to 28 months later, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or threatened by employees and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted, or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the highest standards of the army, because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had been contacted by some 400 other victims in February, many of whom could participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- it will open up a lot of things if needed to maintain pressure.
The defence team of the Ministry of Defence under the direction of the Federal Prosecutor, Neil McBride, has taken steps to put an end to the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly based on the fact that the former or present soldiers cannot claim the military for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 High Court of Justice, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk posed by the military service of the plaintiffs”, says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women have so far been officially forbidden to participate in the fight, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers' teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them fighting.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition, three others are preparing for her.
In the Yeel legal school, the Seminar of the Legal Service of the Veterans prepares a case against four major military academys for the promotion of the feminine atmosphere.
The separate non-commercial association of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a claim against the army, where the diagnosis of “changes of personality” that are being made to victims of violence to remove them from service, is a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwat from the human rights group of the Organization of Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a complaint in December against the Office of Veterinary Affairs, accusing her of discriminatory treatment of people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during service.
Nine separate draft laws proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempts to rape were reported by the Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Traffic.
However, it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and it is estimated that the Pentagon is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought before the court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The charges in the Berk case call them attacks only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape in the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of rape to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from a cut in his hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at the hearing in which she was asked whether she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive trait to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was pink now - I escaped from the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in the psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released with an unfavourable language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case brought forward by Lyman and her research associates is a difficult question, says John Terly, professor of law at the law school of George Washington University.
However, he notes: "I think they are able to move forward."
There is also a verdict between them and the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferres all my life.
The army has remained for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that are responsible.
He adds, "The odds are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for their benefit, Berk, the plaintiff, will collect hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is achieved," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new person of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was a regular guy who exposed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, who had killed 77 people, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Bravik was able to act alone, he was far from alone in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who supported legal groups on social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy to just go to Facebook.
"We understood that it was not difficult to improve," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use an advertising tool on the site to allocate the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketing scientists have been doing so for several years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then put them on advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey of their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to question the extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not so impressive: right-wing online parties are the most common young men, unhappy immigration.
But suddenly, "those who mix their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just stay away from the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politicians use the website to study the world wide, from health to social trends, expressed in "Lakas " , wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook’s “super-current information” is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles entitled 800 per cent in the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook is being used as an opportunity to study people who cannot access the street with a blocknote.
"Before, if you wanted to question people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You should join the party, and they would never accept you," says Bartlett.
"The Facebook excludes all of this - you're addressing him directly."
Others say that this site could identify and investigate social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who had discussed their drunken promotions on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than those who had been silent about it.
Moreno assumes that students' peers, such as their community teachers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Conduct and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children from a risk group that they wouldn't find otherwise."
The Facebook also regularly extracts various data about its users.
The Data Processing Unit has processed statistics on relations and Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in mid-2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using the information available only to them), cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection generally available for research.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility to play in Scrabble with another in thousands of miles of you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for conducting offline research, online data is generally available.
"I don't think that many users would even think that a researcher could monitor their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using the public student pages in Facebook.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
You can't tell on Facebook how much information you really have on the profile and on the user page.
"What you're saying on Facebook, and what you're doing outside Facebook, is two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite years of work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that blocknotes and pens are still the best research tools available.
"Nothing can change the way out into real peace and communication with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline."
Cold and inhuman: Anders Bering Bravik will be brought before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who was aware of the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Riçarey Templiers of Norway," he spoke before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't admit my guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he “did not want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views”.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who had brought with him a written statement, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Bravik in the eye, while others were convinced that he was under lockup.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors of the Utah.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made it a little easier for me personally after I saw and heard the suspect."
He wore a dark suit and a blue tie, and Brawick kept calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he came in and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not mistaken and said that there was no evidence that he was acting with his associates.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of 22 July are considered to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But it doesn't reduce the automatic pain and humiliation that the whole nation now feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It'd be so much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview showing at the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can consider as the biggest opening in a recent re-discovered interview, which they have recalled in the premonition of premonitions in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and a hippie, but he was also a sufficient organizer and a modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “the disease to think that a really great idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea is separating a huge amount of skilled work from a large product.”
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerd TV series on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he was already working in his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of mass Internet development.
While a small portion of the Kringley interview was used in the Nerds, he said the original interviews were missing during transportation.
Only after Jobs died was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This film, a little edited, became the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The Lost Interview, which comes out at Landmark Theatres on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person who is known for his hate for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unusually willing to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different times during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - 10-15 seconds of thinking, where Jobs obviously weighs his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems to be angry with Kringley’s issues, making him move faster to issues or more important phenomena.
In the pre-Earth of Pixara, iPods and iPhones, the Lost interview is something more vicious when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about Job's postmortem assessments, but there's something early and inspiring in Job's, which we see here, an alarming dreamer at the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things might and should have been.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you're always getting, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I knew.
Jobes continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline his reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by the recording of expenditures often starting with “standard costs”, which were taken from the ceiling and then pursued by “precision”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business costs even to small amounts.
About the joke over the Pope:
Jobes details the blue box he has mastered with Steve Vozniak, a device that has enabled people to effectively break up their phone and call for a long distance free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Job's euphoria here describes the blue box as an act of authority being contagious.
He tells how he and Voznjak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We covered the earth's layer half a thousand times, and you were screaming at the phone-car, and it went through a minute later on to the next phone-car," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we adopted was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could master a little thing that could control a lot of things -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever appear.
Jobes continues to describe in detail one significant outcome he and Voznjak had practically achieved, calling to the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, out of all the strengths they were trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the various members of the Catholic hierarchy were challenged in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two of them became laughing just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold reputation of Bill Hullett):
When he was 12 years old, he was hunting for spare parts to collect the frequency meter, and he found Bill Hullett in his phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received summer work at Hullett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view that such a company and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the research labs of Palo Alto, where he saw the first desktop computer.
He was sized with a locker, he had a small monitor with an electronic-right tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often went to HP as a teenager and turned around the car and wrote programs for her.
About improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs is talking about the invention of new products in the summer.
When he went out to sell a piece of furniture, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days in the loan, he had to think about both the collection and the delivery of ready devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the angry arguments... they screamed at me that it would take five years to collect a mouse that would cost $300, and I was stuck on my throat, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large energy-loss companies:
Long before he led the rebirth of Apple, Jobs accurately predicted that many industry leaders had erred in the situation and lost control of their market share.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [those types of people] who eventually come under company management, and the people who make the product are getting out of the decision-making areas.
The product gene that has led to this monopoly position is strained by people who do not have any idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times more, he could be Microsoft 90s...
They have been defeated by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
"The great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work... when you unfold a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her fineness.
There are compromises that you need to go to - some things you can't force you to do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in mind, these concepts, combining them all together...
In the end, it's all about taste, it's about trying to express itself better than people have ever done, and then it's about trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists cheat.
We've always been ashamed of great ideas.
Part of what he did to the famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best specialists in information technology in the world.
If not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the political issue, would it listen to the removal of President Obama ' s health law, his two judges, Antonine Scalia and Clarence Thomas, honored the lunch sponsored by the legal firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court?
This was the case last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the cases on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states that challenged the urgent review of the health adopted by the Congress last year, which brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the renegotiation of the debate is expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to become a interference in the presidential race, which will be in the heat of the day when the court is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the Health Act should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during the presidency of George W. Bush.
The legal firm Clementa, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently defended conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who had a huge financial interest in weight.
Lunch was held in Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The first guests at lunch, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the activities of the Federalist Society for many years.
And that doesn't go against ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have come under Principle 4C of the Code, which reads: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be the rapporteur, guest or mentioned in the programme of such activities.”
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was sufficient signal for ethical activists in the Government.
"This flagrant violation of ethics and indifference to the Code contradicts the statements made by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
“The judges drank and ate at the official fundraiser with lawyers who are currently being tried in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all declarations of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of federalists.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is a ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were filed at the level of the Court of First Instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show anything that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion order for aircraft
Emirates's airline orders 50 large-scale liners Boeing 777 and perhaps will order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the amount of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is receiving orders for 50 units of its produce.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft builder Boeing Co., and the preliminary price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
So important is where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, growing gold, lived the future orders on airplanes.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced in these exits its largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 two-pass Boeing 777.
The incredible order came from the air carrier Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total preliminary price to $26 billion, Boeing said in Aviashou Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can enjoy much better fuel savings and passenger comfort.
The preliminary six-plane price will be more than $1 billion.
"It really is very good for Boeing," said the analyst Morningstar Nile Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East aircraft are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they do not only have the money to pay for aircraft, but also the increase in fuel prices that usually harm airlines, as this is one of the biggest items of expenditure, is not so much a loss, because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important, because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order when prices grow, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates Order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to prevent airbus SAS from attempting to reach its domination with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus said that it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes just once since 777-300ER.
He postponed the duty to increase the axle load after the buyers needed to increase the load capacity and flight distance.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexico President's sister apparently lost her election in Michoakane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealers helped the opposition Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Kalderon seems to have failed to implement her application for Governor Michoakana ' s place during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers had helped to move the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Valeho of the Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is a leader in the race instead of the governor of the Western State.
“Intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming not only to Michoakana but also to the whole country”, said Luis Maria Calderon on the radio interview the next day after the resurrection.
"They scared our candidates, our election workers... they caught the polling hours, put obstacles... and made people vote for the IPR.
IPR managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares for the return, and the victory in Michoakan is an important step in this attempt.
IPR hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valejo seems to have been just a little bit yanked by Calderon, who was leading the polls until the day of the election.
Kalderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND, headed by her brother, refused to recognize Valecho as the winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolution Party, or the DDR, which now belongs to the governorate chair, came the third - a serious defeat for the divided and failed left in the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines were held for a long time.
This is the home state of President Kalderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
Mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he was harassing Luis Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race for fear.
For the IPR, however, no matter how horrendous the elections in Michoacán, the victory will give a driving impetus to the party.
The man who was supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pen Neeto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valecho, and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the coming year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has forced India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB Office in Manila, said that the two most rapidly developing major economies should “do everything they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries were looking at Europe ' s difficulties “in a sense” and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"That's why anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, that must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's loan funds have grown rapidly, and both Italy and Greece's prime ministers have resigned.
The developing debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could bring the world economy back into recession, and called upon leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be implemented through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous strength in the negotiations with the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a reduction in exports and a reduction in foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young people and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies such as India, it makes no sense to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult to provide political assistance to Europe for the Indians, of whom about 800 million live for $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will know that Greeks retire for 50 years and travel to the sea for holidays, and this will not be well understood," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to include Greek and well-paid public sector workers in poorly-organized, loss-making enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis was threatening “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB's projected 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “decreasing risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed “emergency plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant flows of capital from their economies.
Terrible Pentagon warnings on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, met on Monday at the Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and lead to a financial chain response from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already accustomed to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but it is now feared that additional reductions of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress is unable to reach the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panettet reported in a letter to the senators of the Republic of John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to adopt a budget agreement and resulting in the so-called sequencing initiated a total reduction of 23 per cent and the cessation of many new projects.
“This severe reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible — you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building — and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our staff and, since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost have to fire the staff to achieve our goals."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to the military."
The cuts will eventually affect the military parts, Panetta said.
“Although military financing in foreign emergency operations has not been directly affected by the sequentialities, military achievements are seriously affected by a serious budget gap”, cautioned Panetta.
“Contract staff will be reduced to complete the termination of the contracts and the supervisory treaty that supports the army.”
“Staff will be reduced to delay payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the sequester in the Ministry of Defence, the United States will be rapidly defeated as the world military leader."
"We stand firm against this draconian action," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they issued a letter to Panetta.
"It's not the way we can live, and it's not the way we have to put ourselves together."
“Secvere is a threat to the national security of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the letter of the Panetteta or the last warnings of the senators will lead to a budgetary compromise or will strengthen the calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions, see later.
The panel was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although it had come to work under the leadership of the Pentagon many years after the budget experts in Congress and the White House and realized that it faced a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a negative picture of what could be followed further -- a shelled but nuclear-free army.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free team."
"It's a wing without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable spirit of war, ill will and inability to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panette, he added further details on how “reductions create significant operational risks: delay the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already passed the tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
The list includes a single impactor F35, a planned new bomber, a ballistic submarine of a new generation, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based combat vehicle required by the Army and the Marine infantry to replace the hammer.
The further development and testing of F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters said that this was a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats to China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
The view of the latest headlines shows how serious and widespread fraud and lying are in everyday life.
The candidate for the presidents of the Republicans, Herman Kane, is engaged in the prosecution of sexual harassment by several women; each party is accused of lying to the other.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was accused of lying because they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was arrested when he told US President Barack Obama on the included microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying their exits, which was quickly rejected by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial manipulation during the campaign relating to non-marriage coverage.
And yet, none of the living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relations with Monica Levinski during her second term in office.
The story of cheating at school and college is an ordinary case.
There were times when teachers gave their students answers to the tests to make a good evaluation of the results of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite report that lying and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we deal with?
In one day, as research shows, you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
Much of this is now supposed to be a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating each other.
Finding a lie or identifying a lie is necessary for every skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like, say, the charades, where to call "Fall!", the discovery of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the last six decades in prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been disbanded.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stop, sneeze, red or dry.
It should not be concluded that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
The experienced disclaimer may come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mime, the structure of issues and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years researching scientific findings in an ever-increasing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that finding a lie is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide in our difficult world -- especially if your professional duties include recruitment, interviewing, negotiating or management.
Good liars are better able to read to others, making them feel unrestrained, managing their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials are more likely than inverters, that men lie more about themselves, while women are more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less likely to talk to their partners than unmarried (but the lie that they say is most often sudden).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know anybody's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "the state of origin."
This helps to ensure a starting point for further assessment of changes.
Watch the posture, smile, voice characteristics of your object.
You'd better know if you're always kicking people's feet in a normal state, if you don't make unfair accusations when you see them kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then find a group of fraudulent verbal and non-verbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of fraud.
Deceivers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can set their feet toward the door, turn to the exit, change their position in a certain way, or demonstrate “facilitation after interview” — this excessive propensity for relief and change of position when all the difficult issues are behind.
The investigators often falsify the end of the survey to look at the relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson withdrew and used his time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her searches throughout the country.
Enormous people may also use distance in saying, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the complicated question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are hardly catchable.
Someone can use the "qualification language" when they answer the tricky question, "Well... I'm telling you the truth... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actually, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to find a lie, but it is possible to learn the art of deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming victims of professional and personal predators.
The dispute plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be reviewed after the US threat of delaying its approval.
A few days later, after Obama had threatened to delay the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- in anger of the trade unions, but in calming environmentalists -- the oil pipeline company claims that it will willingly review the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hill area in Nebraska and be sure that the project would still be approved.
The company called for this decision at a press conference in the capital of the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, although with another route.
This occurs after a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone a decision on the draft at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sand Hill of Nebraska and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the State Department is likely to respond to the decision by 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama called for a decision by the State Department and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline must extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Albert to the oil pipelines in Texas.
To accomplish this, he has to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by trade unions that hope for about 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hill area and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the Department of State Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry said that the Department ' s auditor had ordered a separate expert review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was a consultant in Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another choice was the company that was hired to conduct the initial investigation was inappropriate because it was related to TransCanada.
At Patty LaBell, she was tried for allegedly causing the child to be terrified.
The family in New York claims that Patty LaBell's disco-wildering began to explode in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring them to the point of being so scared.
Lady Marmalade's tyrant frightened 18-month-old Geneva Monk so strongly that she moved her family to the Supreme Court of Manhattan to "change personality, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers".
This happened on 10 November last year when Kevin Monk, his wife, the educator of the child now, Rosanna, and Geneva were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the wall of the building on the Riverside bubble with their luggage, took Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell made an excuse for a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosaanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to use insults -- the word "C" and the word "F" -- in increased tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from a bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had a beginning of hysteria.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the baby.
LaBell leaned on her mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her companion had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The little girl cried so much that she was bored, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBell a note of apology but did not receive an answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBell do not respond to the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but family attorney Sam Davis said that he had taken the case for free and that the family planned to contribute any money that would benefit children with ill cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child's educator now with an 18-month-old on his hands."
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopes in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market had grown, foreign financing had decreased and the economy had been weakened.
The year 2011, which will enter Sinaloa ' s economic history as the first year related to the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but a reduction in the main indicators of economic development was recorded.
The low temperatures of February did not only lead to the loss of millions for the agricultural sector, but limited the potential for growth of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, affecting the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the freezing provided by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, 78.03 per cent of which were affected in whole and 21.07 per cent were affected in part.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters of the population, an accelerated increase in unemployment from January to March 55,053 of Sinaloa's population was unemployed, with 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, and in the second quarter the proportion rose to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, which in turn accounted for more than 74,000 of Sinaloa ' ' s unemployed people, with an increase of 18.969 compared to the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been covered by many factors over the year, for economist Gerardo Lopez Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained in particular by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted at Congress to combat money-laundering, since people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use in something," he said.
Suspension of immigration
Lopez Servantes said there was still a demographic factor in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave abroad in search of work has been limited in the United States, mainly because of the difficulties of entry and, secondly, because, once they have entered, they are already facing very many difficulties in finding work, so that the group of people remains and demands jobs here, in the state, as a result of unemployment,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market of Sinaloa is becoming worse if a large number of violations prevailing in the labour market are noted by INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population, without being referred to as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses, another reminder of the state's work is presented by low wages; in the country's lowest wages, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos, much lower than the country average, representing 7,375 pesos.
Deduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was estimated at $630,697 from January to July, showing a fall of 87,74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government has recorded a total of 17,280,000 investment pesos during the year, which mainly came from service companies.
Length
In the light of the economic downturn, the State Government requested in July at the State Congress the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, a total of 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and the debt benefits were not expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez demonstrated a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopes, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that there was no agreement during 2011 on the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State alone.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it takes a lot of work to return the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to agree on all efforts and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Deceleration of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezing had stopped the state economy and its effectiveness and growth was limited this year.
“The low levels of economy are the result of several events, including the freezing, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create economic dynamics, which enables us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, we close it below our expectations at the end of the year,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme needs to be developed to redefine the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Future work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, but there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
Five years of imprisonment and a fine of 100 days' income, such a sentence was handed down to a citizen of Nabalto for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a health crime, had in this case stored marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valençuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the Cyprus Valdes street, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the white truck’s wheel, where he carried a black bag in the car’s box, while on the passenger seat, a small backpack, where soldiers found eight pounds [8 kg] and 23 grams [23 kg] of marijuana.
For these reasons, the prisoner was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continued to remain in the Centre ' s support for the legal consequences of the crime.
Contributions to work should be made
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants is likely to remain unfinished or long-term because of lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although the work programmes have so far developed, they are in danger, since the Government is unable to make the corresponding contributions, which amount to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent was required, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for work, so it is still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny, when from the beginning of July they had to give us a share," he said, "that we don't delay, we've started work and they've moved very forward, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Agilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the reign of the municipality it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which was not provided by the State administration.
“This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programmes continued to develop, and this year in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains to be the state,” he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to supply these resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to step up efforts to ensure that the percentages relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They have to bring almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the “turnover to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which carries the so-called “turnover to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juana Silva Messa, felt that President Felipe Kalderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of the eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree and remain in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olgo Sanchez Cordero proposed that a decree be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme - a law established by the law of the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel) - would violate the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margaret Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this point, both the Senate and the House of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transition to digital media.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputies, without entering into discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project ' s arguments in the sense that the Federal Executive could not lay down the general rules of the measure to be prepared by the State Administration.
“I also do not think that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and reminded me that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, government.
The replacement of analogue digital signals - one of the most important changes in recent years - has led to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the postponement of the benefits of the conversion into a digital form, which includes meeting the public needs, which are not only technical dimensions, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These issues, he said, “need the work of the whole system established by the principle of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution brings together into the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transfer and had done so through the executive, despite the availability of specialized technical agencies.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects Congress ' s competence, enforces the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
At Michoakan, they analyze the possibility of counting “voice by vote”
According to data submitted to the PRTR, the difference between the first and the second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of protocols 6,074.
The possibility of counting “voting” is real with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoakán, where, according to the data obtained from the Provisional Election Results Programme (PRP), the difference between the first and the second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of protocols 6,074.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Míchoakana Institute of Elections (IMM), Maria de Los Angeles Léideral Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal date for their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Ringel did not include it in the publication within the time limits set out in the Law in the State Official Journal, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJC) decided on a constitutional claim brought by the local legislative assembly and called the vote of the State representative on constitutional reform “unfair and illegal” as he did not have the right “to permit or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of “voting” Maria de los Ángeles Lünderal stated that, by adopting the appropriate principles, the General Council of the IMF would enable a partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more polling hours may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no vote and count protocol in the urn or it is not in the Chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a general re-calculation of votes in all polls may take place where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged winner of the elections in question and those who received the second vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that issued the second of those candidates.
A total recalculation of votes will also be made if it is established at the end of the ordinary count that the difference between the winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party to which the second-place candidate took place, in the event of the exclusion of the electoral polls that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRTR, the difference between the first and the second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without considering 129 votes in the total of 923.
His last will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a survey and a restful mass were held on Monday.
According to the family, the colonel's last will was to be separated from the dust in the Sapalinam mountains.
After condolences with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Kouiila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the colonel arrived at an hour when his family and friends arrived at the bakery of Nazario Ortis Garcia.
At 5:30 a.m., he attended the study of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school colleagues and the football team, whose member was Felipe Basio at high school.
"It was his desire to return to Saltilo, and to have his dust scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortez Basio, sister of the pilot.
In her opinion, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she thought he was on the verge of his life, “he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother dedicated to his family.”
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to attend the Air College in Sappane, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had a headache even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davil Basio, will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltilo, the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltilo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapphan for a graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle was killed, doing what he loved most in life: running a plane.
They're taking him the last time.
The fires from the weapons proceeded to the honor of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, the villagers and the government of the State, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the University of Technology in Saltillo, where he had studied in 1985 and had been successful in teaching and in sports, and had conducted him on the last path.
Basio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was running was violated, together with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Black Morey, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortez (creeded), the resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force funeral office, headed by Major James Martinez, to a training school, where he was already expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found thrown on the LL Kadereita farm
Within hours of the detection, military authorities showed eleven people in the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes involving organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a gunshot at a abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereithe Hymenes, Nuevo Leon.
The finding was found at 1.5 kilometres of Caderita's highway towards Santiago, at a high point in the municipality known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that in a rural house, the wall of which was decorated as a run - down and a black one, the door was open.
By looking inside, literally three meters, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow football with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one meter was the body of another man, in red robes and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed in another location, as there was no dig in the area.
There are signs addressed to one organized crime group of another at the village house, and there are several pool holes in it and in the gates.
11 captures in Kaderaite
The Ministry of National Security introduced 11 persons, including minors, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly active in the municipality of Kadereit, who were charged with kidnappings, murders, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to the published information, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony, and one person who was in hostages was saved.
They were provided with three homes and telephones, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event occurred on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., military personnel took a patrol trip to the village of Old Rancho in Kadereite when they saw a car with no signs of two men in the living room.
By stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a patrol and 18 patrols.
Later, on 13 November, at 14:00 a.m., one of their associates was stopped on the public land of La Prada, which, having seen the soldiers, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret funerals in the municipalities of General Teran, Heina and Kadereit.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has put the country in the way of the economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has put Italy at the forefront of the economic disaster and has damaged the whole of the euro area.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present an office composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive body will take its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to choose from this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not directly say he was able to form the Government, but his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well defined," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government less than three days, which is much less common, because Italy has been fighting a political and financial crisis that has raised its debt to critical levels.
The administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monty must adopt the package of hard savings required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure from Monty to speed up the unstable markets, Italy ' s BTP bonded income was 10 years higher than 7 per cent, at which the level Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty: "We said that we would actively support this government."
We believe that this is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP's Silvio Berlusconi party, which was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfano, the Secretary of the Centralist-Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government ' s majority of the technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of a hard economy.
Any blocking or suspending of these efforts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure by warning that Monty's failure can be a disaster.
Monty began consultations Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish a series of his meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monty was appointed on Sunday to Naples, which allowed for a very rapid transition to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy's debt value had now reached a critical level in the background of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern euro area financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite popular expectations, that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only by technical experts, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation.
Political sources reported that the mutual distrust and disagreement of the parties made it difficult to include political figures.
More Spanish gaming experience than Tikos
Of the 22 games claimed in Spain, ten have already played 50 international games.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players claimed to have played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, compared with 22 games that both countries have played for a match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While as in the world and Europe, the number one in FIFA's monthly rating, has a full list of Class A reverse games, in Tricolour, there is only Michael Oman's defender as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandes.
Spanish footballers playing in the League of All Stars and in the British Premier Leagues were very active during this year in the league and in the local cube competitions, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To this end, the experience of the Spanish Fury in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship should be added.
In the Tikos games, however, there is limited international experience in the area such as CONCACF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish collective gallop Iker Kasilis, who last Sunday against England (the match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former galloper Andoni Subisarreta with 126 international matches.
Casilias is playing against Tricolora today and will establish a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Havy Ernandez, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Cassiles and Havys were recognized best last week by UEFA along with another Iberian team player, Subisarreta, with 126 matchrs and shelling of Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly a hundred Carles Puyoll with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them from 91, Fernando Torres - from 90, David William and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Inyesta - from 62, Sesk Fabregas - from 61, and David Silva - from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica next to Michael Oman, left side Hunior Dias with 48 fighters and bomber Brian Ruis from 45.
Furthermore, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Caylor Naas from 31, Randall Asofefa from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36, and José Luis Lopes from 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gerar Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santo Casarla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
There is Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26 matches, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Moore with 23.
The others didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivara alone, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet won.
Spanish leader David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more points twice as much as Carlos Ernandes and three times as much as Roy Moore and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of 20 years of career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview, Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group was ready to give one of the best concerts at the National Stadium the next morning.
It was more than 20 years of expectations, but the group said that they also had a dream that had become a reality to play in that country.
This was a statement by the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in the territory of South America in the course of the tour for the twentieth year of work and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20th.
On that day they will be at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local team of Las Robertas.
It's a excerpt from the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
Traveling to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's all going well.
I was in Costa Rica just once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask because there is some loyalty to the group; the fans live in tension the day before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've been playing for the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope it's brought us into the form of this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we like to take care of the serf and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfers, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends are always taking care of serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are excellent places for serfing, as we've learned, from people who love serfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you made a great show with lots of songs.
What were you planning on doing in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show out of possible songs with the most variety of songs; we will try to play several songs from each album and present to our fans a wide variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us, so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
That's what you've been doing for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it like a dream.
We rejoice in our successes and are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we love to create music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean for you to be an important part of the branch’s growth?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's healthy when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from one city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
I've been playing with some of them for a while.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and to be an honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that has been achieved.
It is also very strange that a group of your kind remains together in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to this, musical routes have also been opened that give every freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How are you balanced?
When we grew up, it became easier to strike a balance.
We'll make sure you don't be on the tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did not decide to be famous and be a rock star, which none of us really cares about.
What do you remember about your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and it was great at first.
We've been a group for almost three years and we haven't released any albums until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was a lot of disappointment, because it took so long, and most importantly, that we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about the amazing person Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of others.
He was an amazing man, and we miss him.
The local team of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few videos, and this was a group that we liked most, so we can't wait to see that Las Robertas could offer a living, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He's drinking it, and I think he's using the first thing in his head.
Who influenced you like a bassist?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entvisle, CJ Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
They're so much that I can tell you all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the value of the branch despite his being no longer fashionable?
I think we're all feeling a little isolated from the word of the chain.
When I think about it, it reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great, because it's music that needs to be heard, and the Mudhoney teams now create music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it is more positive.
How do you explain this change?
That's interesting, because, I think there are some songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, though they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, those songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or another, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was re-hospitalized for medical examination
The former president, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, and his family doctor informed him about the loss of muscle power in his legs.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the language he was operated four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, a personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be surveyed within three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Agina said that, in his view, Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations into his tongue, lost 18 kilograms of weight, and other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, iron oxides, stones in the pancreas, high blood pressure, and blood flow problems in the legs, were listed by the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the army's destruction squad, which operated secretly in the first years of his rule.
Muhika is moving to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation headed by Uruguayan President José Muhika and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will be visiting Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, on Wednesday, the most important item in the broad plan of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “good for sharing information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership has published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Kalderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozy included the South American country in a tax receipt at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cancún.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay's protest and a withdrawal for the consultation of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development from countries that do not enjoy international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Mexico and Uruguay has been in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The wet water supply will become three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has been fighting for over 25 years to save Princess Dude from the evil lap of Bouzer, but never before has he done this in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, is based on the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell you how to work stereoscopy without fingerprints," said Nintendo, a head of the press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially designed under this platform", because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that despite 3D existence, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allowed you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
On the one hand, most experts will go “on the second round” at the level of games that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and "do not submit to optical illusions".
This Super Mario invasion in three dimensions also marks the return of a hero to a portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo is migrating to the fans of the series and repeating a successful formula from the previous games, the watertight watertighter must go through dangerous ground platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies as well as Louis player.
The wheel guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo ' s extradition process had begun to respond in the United States to a $70 million lease.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which called for the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At the press conference, Cole said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “applyed hands” to legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for drug trafficking.
What was done by Colom shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the ex-chief of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the loss of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process of previous extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people out of the risk group
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the Trinijove Social Support Organization for the first 25 years are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have been helped to cope with difficult situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The anniversary served as a basis for the ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people had arrived.
Trinijove came to light near the Velia Trinity in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that had cooperated with the association during those 25 years.
The various political representations during the elections showed the unique nature of the work done by Trinijov.
Following the President of the Generality, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhol, former socialist education counselor Ernest Maragal and former mayor and current eco-socialist, Richard Goma, visited the ceremony.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Luis Cleris and SEO on the social work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared in the light in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
The President introduced Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad circumstances and the spread of hope in people experiencing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for her organization and work," he said.
Captured building where mass parties were organized has been evacuated
Arresters occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 okuppans left the building yesterday afternoon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in the house of 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Yesterday afternoon, 12 people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied and where they held mass parties that upset neighbors by the court's decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a check-in," said the manager.
The shipyards, which occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the others settled, allocated all the electricity and part of the water, broke down the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a place for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and upset the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The ruler, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that since the building was occupied, its income has fallen by 80%.
The club's owner says that the building's captors forced her into unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she noted that the noise was caused, not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the square and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had been increased, as said by the angry neighbors.
The owner of the club said that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's nine months ago, as he "forgived" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received in recent weeks from neighbours.
The president of the PP municipal group, consultant Alberto Fernand Dias, called for “the immediate evacuation of the building last week to address the problems of coexistence and the general spirit of the neighbours and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but in the last few months the quarries had invaded all the floors and virtually every room, and that some of them had been broken.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against a culture that is built in a building."
So yesterday, police officers evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police went to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after a review of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the closing point of the Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promotions for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park once again became aware of many as Barcelona's highest point as the capital of Catalonia, one of a few, not to the north, but to the top (the mountain) to the bottom (the sea).
The positioning of the Colserol as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabin in the role of Yoga bear.
This was so until in September, the Council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other doors in Colserol.
There's no doubt about the idea of a park under the door.
Either way, or someone wants to put the door on the field.
The question is, Colserol?
The competitions, and their organizational side and their impact on the city, are the theme for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And that fact is one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and scientists were saying.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline has been reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “front side of the mountain” when the proposal by Ildefon Hearta, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"You have to admit that Barcelona's largest park is a beach.
Besides, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserol is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Colserol Gate" contains a "word hunt": we should not think of them as "how to enter the park, but as to limit some areas where we should work."
A model, such as Roland and Bayon, with experience in urban construction, called the proposal “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from “uncertainty of public space forecast” after the 80x experience, which ended on the forum “with its faint songs”.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where one can build.
"Limiting something is training for the next step" means moving.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real disaster.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserol valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
The model recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola, which “must not be missed by the ear”, although he is grateful for the opportunity Mary offers his profession to enter the project “from the very beginning”.
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into debates, but “it doubts” whether this technical profile is to be guided by the interdisciplinary teams (“success”), which should have been created: “Architectors should only be a tool”.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that calls this part is complex, because the rules of the competition do not include the general type of Colserola: "There have been 16 cross-border competitions," he says, "in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no long reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one door may be cut through the program and defined with the project of the architect for the next door.
From your point of view, the Council must guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt must provide the area fully equipped for a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabala and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative of Red Casino forgave the brother of Mayor Monterrey in the proceedings against him on charges of acquittal.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which is conducting proceedings against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas claimed to pay for his economic contribution to allow Monterey's authorities to operate secretly in a mine house.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and on 2 September he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crime, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the State capital.
He remained in that place for 49 days, following the requirements of the second prohibition of displacement after the prosecutor had excluded the crime of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was allegedly transferred to Caderita for half a million pesos to the Red Casino owner, but he spent only a few hours there in a prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipal prison in San Nicolas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigations, it was clear enough to prove Jonah ' s guilt, such as 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomes, appeared to Judge José Luis Pesina to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and who was forgiving, even though the lawyer had tried not to make a name.
On the basis of records 197/2011, the lawful pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal and no further claims could be made regarding the process that had been planned against him; no damages or punishment would be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost 15:50, was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The servant court, Jorge Janes, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicholas in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakome relates the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of an accident involving the death of the Minister of the Interior of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in a complete state without attempting to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft was lifted up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the ship had several land contacts, wings came into contact with trees 25 meters where the device lost the flux."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies carried out in the impact area did not report the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reported that there were no ship components elsewhere, and the impact was structurally complete.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements of passenger transport.
The land in this area has a distance from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, chiefly, to achieve results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
However, Gilberto Lopes Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack the Presidential helicopter was at a cruise speed and that this happened on a soft lift.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the team must have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for the take-off when the aircraft moved to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low altitude cloud layers were observed.
Selected paths:
It is possible that because of the cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a zone of less altitude and greater visibility in the Kuernawak valley.
It's a strike scene.
The impact coordinates and the latest flight radar records are likely to coincide, before the impact, with no loss of control or change of direction.
Decomposition of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and the side.
The dispersal of the cracks suggests that the helicopter has hit the ground in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, no evidence remains in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that multiple land contact could occur.
During work on the ground, aircraft pieces were found at 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground had a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The picture shows the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough investigation in more territory than the area identified near the site of the disaster, no parts of the aircraft were found, which confirms the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces a search program for the digestive gene
Social protection leads to a study on the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by experts from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study was being carried out to detect the digestive gene in children and young people, who had received the title “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescents”, which would provide an overview of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st-century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopes, explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietitologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is supported by experts and aspirants from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (whether prescribed or not) to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study in the valley of Mexico City, where every Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. tests involving children will be conducted.
He stressed that the protocol began to run at the sports centre in Quautemoque (in western Mexico), and since 8 October the events took place at the sports centre in Nesaualkootel (east Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Sport Centre for Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, at the Sport Centre Morelos (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the importance and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Day against Diabetes will be observed, and the main goal will be to gather three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age and under the supervision of parents to complete individual nutrition surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid the risk factors leading to disease, such as diabetes or an expected insufficiency.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and volume of thali), blood pressure and glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to detect genes related to childhood obesity) would be carried out.
Crus Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only six years of age there has been growth: 77 per cent of boys have suffered from obesity, 47 per cent of girls have experienced excessive weight, and there has also been substantial growth," said MSSI expert.
He said that the justification for finding markers was based on the fact that the country ' s population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the descendants of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the offspring of the Europeans and five per cent of the Africans, and that the condition was affecting the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main consequence of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess energy that we consume (calorie) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or fat.
Even, he said, the presence of dark deposits on the neck (acutes) and foreclosures meant that metabolism and even pre-diabetes were likely to be violated.
The information is confidential, and the doctor transmits it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the way of life that must be undertaken to avoid disease.
Crus Lopes explained that there were three main causes of excessive weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sitting pattern of life, or a lack of daily physical activity, a greater part of the day at home in front of television, and the use of transport at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tumble, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition as analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a modified bitumen polymer to produce a mixture of the best quality that is sustainable to the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent to the road surface were to be given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand dams for each rainy season in the Gulf of Mexico City, says Rafael Errera Nahera, a UNAM chemical scholar, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the asphaltized road surface is correct, its quantity may be reduced or reduced to zero.
His lecture The Technology View of the Caves read in the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer modified bitumen for the production of mixtures with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to counter education.
He explained that bitumen, the most heavy part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbons, some high molecular mass called asphaltenes, and others low molecular mass called maltens, which together add to the road surface its characteristic tightness.
The rapid behavior of the bitumen is that at about 180 degrees high temperatures it conducts itself as a liquid, at 120 degrees very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains almost stable, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that street asphalt resistance is not permanent but is changing throughout the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The scholar Hymphaca noted that the streets of Mexico were mainly covered with a flexible cover, consisting of six layers of material, three of which included bitumen.
Among the top layers are bitumen, made of small stones dropped into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this cover, he said it's loaded in bitumen.
The movement of vehicles and the application of efforts help the forces to get very well across the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the roof of the asphalt, he added that the last layer, called the export layer, made of a small stone, was actually sand also loaded into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt cover and provide road training.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and distribute the effort, the export layer also requires adequate thickness, and the material from which it is produced needs to be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, because it has a significant impact on asphalt.
When the earth is raw, water penetrates the surface and is difficult to get out of it, it causes the spread of all layers of the surface and thus education.
In his education, he said that the first layer of export was exposed and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur immediately, which should be given attention to the first signs of current repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer should always be linked to the transport load and it was necessary to ensure compliance with this requirement in order to prevent frequent exposure.
Rafael Errera said that there was still much to study and do about bitumen, for example, bitumen emulsions that in other countries were already on the market and even helped make holes with ease and without using high temperatures.
Why didn't Vale's candidate become a new Miss Columbia?
An analysis of the causes that prevented Serna Meline Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vale received the princess's title 14 times.
Once again, Vale del Cauca was only interested in obtaining the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna must have been pleased to have come to the victory stage with a silver crown and tape announcing her new Princess of Colombia.
In the light of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the skipper, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legionion of women from Vale del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Heise Alhure Gars (2000), Catalina Garre (2000)
The question that many are now asking:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just was she chosen by the Royal Police and by the most beautiful person in the Vogue version -- the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to condemn her was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question "What book characterizes you and why?" given by Martin Murille Gomes from the literary society Let us respect.
She said to the inquirer:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that a book that characterizes my childhood -- "The Little Prince" -- is a pretty deep book.
Today, I am reading the Crime and Punishment, which is the core of the world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood of Blood."
The answer, which did not like the jury because of the term “culture” and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the cited books characterized it.
But after the ceremony Melina said that she was calm and happy with her outcome: "A happy wise man is what is going to happen."
And all of you, please, read a little bit, "Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the sound hypotheses, Vale burned from favoritism.
The Bogotá reporter suggested that, because of her preference, she met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary contest, the visual vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which caused the zeal of other candidates, brought stress to the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
And this was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on Hilton Beach and during her two performances at the evening coronation.
Although both of them seemed certain, it was noted that it lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic had demonstrated.
Ariel Osario, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess means that the candidate who wins more prizes during the competition does not become queen.
In addition, the representative of Vale has recently avoided communication with the press, and this has been incorrect.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotti, said they were looking for a woman dedicated to the social needs of their country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only at the outside, but also focus on public awareness, before they participate in the competition, they need to be involved in projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Vale was wrong with the defects in the jocks and fibrosis that was seen in her life, but it was controversial, because the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
King Jorge Ernan Orosko's consultant notes that Melina had no better body, which was even better, "but the problems of fibrosis in life that were not very noticeable to me made her lose her eyes on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Crocos believes that the error of the representative of Vale-de-Cauca was that she had undergone surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which for the first time was held by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prediction had taken place last night, it was said that it was a teacher whom Raymondo had given to Melina as a compensation for her lack of pleasure to receive the crown.
Whether or not, Melina's present year of rule begins today, not as queen, but as princess, with a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will go into history as one of the kings who, despite his excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in receiving the crown.
This was the work of the man who met the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminal from Kali went into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Kano's death.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali, a criminal, went into history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Kano to compare his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at the ITC, Elisa González, a man from Puerto Tehada, had been "during the 21st year of the trial" this week.
At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach places where bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale, and after finishing his courses, he became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied skin training, i.e. ladones and columns.
On the Sunday of Elisa ' s operations on human identity, known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to wear no more than three days ' clothing.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Caucasian in Palmyra.
He knew that he would need to know two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who led the world's oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his name).
However, when he arrived with the study group where the body was located, he did not recognize it in an outward appearance; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without points and much more.
But prints don't work.
Using a magnifying glass, a black one, a shovel, and a flashlight, Eliezer compared the fingerprints of the body to those in the pictures.
His eyes were not raised: it was Alfonso Kano.
That same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada asked the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson to confirm that he was the head of the CSR.
Searching for fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonzalez at the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for the doctoral officer of Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Doctiloscopy is a hard science, without mistake, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, D.C. specialists have participated in investigations into crimes such as theft and murder, and have established the identity of detainees.
In detention, many offenders have false certificates or no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the war was held by hands to control the safe, the full value, and the money.
"It is difficult to work with walls because they are not comfortable surfaces for printing, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole story and establish the identity of the criminal who participated in several thefts," he said.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in cases involving murder.
A dead man was recently found with bottles under a liqueur around him.
The investigation found that the crime could have involved a suspect relative and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A doctoral specialist from CTI explained that there is a chemical or physical reagent in the place where the prints are placed.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Thereafter, fingerprints are sent to Asif, who is a criminal database, or entered into the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it was not all as shown in the CSI television programme.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything that you touch, leaves a mark on you.
However, if possible, a comparison will be made.
“Disgraced People” Challenges to the New York authorities
Hundreds of protestors broke camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Some of the protestors heard the court ' s decision to expel the demonstration from the square and went to the neighboring park.
The Wall Street Arresters launched a call to the authorities of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to reenter, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated in the light while trying to capture another Major Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors were buried in Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get by a court order that allowed "disgraced people" to break the camp in the square until the other part of the movement responded to the riot by taking the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to break the camp in the field, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for return to Zukotti and through peaceful ambushes and demonstrations," said Mark Brey, a representative of the Wall Street Movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "exploited people" to the evacuation of the town, which was personally ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was brought before a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the grounds and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, “disgraced people” began to capture a new park on the site of a merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could occupy this place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, though Brei could not name the exact number, but Efek said he saw several journalists who were also in the handcuffs.
The Organization assures that several hundred people were standing with the tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as mediator in negotiations with the police.
However, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will consider the legality of today ' s early departure of protestors.
Some of the protesters who were sent there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time, and even gave them to a police guard, which led to “some small clashes”, said Brei, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The Judicial Decree prohibits the authorities from evacuated members of the Wall Street Prison movement and from forcing them to enforce “laws that were issued after the arrest, or to prohibit demonstrators from regaining access to the park with stores and other property previously used.”
Ms. Bloomberg told reporters that the Court's decision suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators were informed of this, but local laws did not allow them to re-exploit tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protestors from the area of Zukotti, which was carried out in the light of an operation involving about 200 arrests, and a decision was taken on this because the protesters “infringed the law”.
Bloomberg said he had given orders to clean the area because it became “a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others” as “some businesses were threatened” and the neighbors feared “the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation conducted this morning was repulsive and showed that in the depth of Bloomberg's spirit there was a greater interest in protecting the financial interests of the American workers," added a representative of the movement who condemned the mayor for “deserving freedom of speech”.
The authorities responsible for Zachvati Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize “magnificent actions” on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Birth of Russell Peters" on 1 December.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen at the "Great Repair", a rescuer at the "Savers of Malibu", Banny at the "Playboy", a woman rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV's private TV today announced that Anderson, together with the coroner (executor of the ballad) Michael Buble and other Canadians, will appear on the television program "Birth of Russell Peters" on 1 December, which is a very special role for Mary.
CTV today presented a television show, in which Anderson, also known as the popular home porn video on the Internet, depicts her with her still husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, who is holding a doll in the hands of Jesus.
In this scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently performed as the leader of the tour "My Cruel Torpedoes of Truth" Charlie Shine, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Canadian singer Bubble participates in the special Christmas show CTV, which at the end of March married in Buenos Aires on the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato, and also knows a lot about scandals.
Bubble recently called American Suko Kim Cardassian during one of his concerts in New York City
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the fall burden that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed and so far being hit by a devastating earthquake, a nuclear crisis, the most horrendous disaster carried on by the country of the rising sun since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo Government, material losses amounted to $300,000 -- a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seemed to be going on.
After three loss-making quarters, data on gross domestic product from July to September have helped to reverse the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The second quarter, which is beginning in March 2012 for Japanese, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery may be partly due to the re-purchasing of machinery for the restoration of areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of capital costs, which was seen from January to March, the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse, which calls for a crisis to be used to strengthen, or restructure, infrastructures using lies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up, mainly thanks to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent by increasing vehicle, travel and rest costs.
Paste the image
Tokyo has provided the internal market when the Japanese currency has become one of the "currency currencies" selected by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that dwindles as a stone on behalf of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, are guilty of jane in their low performances from July to September.
As long as markets continue to remain in the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Esihiko Noda does not decrease its alertness.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the sharp increase in its value, Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic downturn in September.
The indicator, which predicts a break in the world economy, showed that the main forces were slowing down.
He then dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone even dropped below the average value of 100 points after falling to eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Affaires give way to doubt again
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the periphery premiums for risk and uncertainty in parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The sense that the “agreement” of the new transitional Government of Ellada is being imposed rather on the requirements of Brussels than on the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the one-day period agreed upon at his appointment might be insufficient for their application, conservative party leader, New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of the Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will end tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new executive authority.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not express any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The Conservative leader has taken a step further in his views on the EU and IMF, organizations that need to freeze 8,000 million who are urgently needed by Athens, and has explained that he will not approve any letter of agreement with the treaty requirements.
But the European Commission, still distraught by the effects of the Papandreou referendum's claims in all or nothing style, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign “a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafay, said that the inspectors of the troika could return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new Government what should be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been indicated.
There'll be plenty of strings in the Greek club for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain’s “main” position on this type of finance
Spain “has made a prominent position in the world in the area of microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation, whose “essentialness”, she said, is that it is “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in humans”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valiadolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt”, that such “perfectly necessary” action is needed to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “with a particular aim of reducing the number of people living below one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded”.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of beneficiaries worldwide and assume this task with “responsibility”, says Donkey Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements at the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “provide new capacities and opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, the “main beneficiaries of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and hundreds of millions of these households would be excluded from the poverty they were burdened with.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “was on the way from years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized by Mrs. Sofia as “an act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "defeated idealist in the universal fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy.
This year, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose connection with the project was brought to her yesterday by the title “The Head of the Family”, which was collected in Valyalida as a “poor banker”.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her speech by urging those present to participate in the debate and to make decisions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Trinidad Hymenez said that solidarity was an "ethical imperative" for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the economic boom, as it was a “permanent obligation”.
Hymenus concluded that microcredit is a “serious and solid course aimed at eradicating poverty”, and now “greater than ever” the Governments of developed countries must work according to solidarity criteria and not allow it to become a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the “success” in providing “confidential” to the people “dedicated to whom all the doors are closed”, and Mayor Valiadolida Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “opened their doors with a spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (HDS) Congress on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was without any major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the president of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was only a fall, in particular to satisfy activists who felt that the government's policies were not as strict as they should be with Greece today and perhaps with Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the presidency of the European Commission, which had been issued for discussion by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ova, which continued for a few minutes, who deserved Angela Merkel's statements and several hours later Wolfgang Shobel, the Europhil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the true response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, it's time for a break-in in Europe.
This could mean changes to the Treaty of Lisbon, which would make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control of the eurozone's financial policy, but this could also affect the European Commission's election by a general vote, “to give Europe a face”.
In any event, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nikola Sarkozy is against it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member country of the European Union in the European Central Bank according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wanting to calm down the situation in his party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kola, but she did not seek to influence the Congress through "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that liked to criticise "high" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe refers to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Remember, two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a fake with hospital records?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the Government began to attack hospitals.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will come to Bordo to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and address this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And in order to help this incident, which arose out of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of the right to re-election as presidents, most would like to focus on hospital records.
First of all, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private company workers the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer ' s special consent, the sick worker loses four days ' pay equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to cause a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day on public servants without payment of sickness benefit (the public servants had not yet expected payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day expectations of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, the majority also reiterates the subject of fraud, with regard to abuse in issuing hospital letters.
Control will become more rigorous and add-on, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you have received," Xawya Bertran warned at the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat out of proportion to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have been subject to constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the country numbers first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 of EUR 11.3 million was 5% of the total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for the statutory leave and accidents of production and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 million euros.
As a result, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures were incurred.
The French were hospitalized for an average of 14.5 days in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said they did not take one day of the hospital.
Another study on health insurance claims that in 2010 37 per cent of patients were less than 8 days long, 15 per cent from 15 to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months long, and 11 per cent from 11 per cent longer.
By comparing these figures with the figures of European neighbours, it appears that French workers are no longer inclined to take hospital than those of any other country.
The long-term study conducted by the two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall proportion of absence in France (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10 per cent to 11 per cent, compared with 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital records is very low compared to "serious" employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, it is very low.
The strengthening of the law after 2002 has led to systematic inspection of the length of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases reviewed, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term findings were “unjustified” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records over 45 days, 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were reported as “inappropriate or unwarranted”, or 132 000.
In general, 169,000 cases were reported to have been “unreasonable” for several million workers who received hospital letters.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, serial numbers.
According to UMP MP Dominica Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amounted to between €9,000 and $15,000 of unaccompanied budget revenue a year, exceeding the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore endlessly higher than the loss of fraud.
Paralysis: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
This was stated on Monday, 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos in Parliament, adding that 100 days provided to his coalition Government were insufficient to fulfil this task.
"In order to achieve the goals of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme," said the head of the Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on this confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “main task” of the new Government, since the country’s presence in Eurozone has been “put on the map”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit of “approximately 9 per cent” from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to reject measures by a new Government
On Monday, the leader of law, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of a tight economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with Members of his New Democracy Party.
He expressed his agreement with the challenges of reducing deficits and debt and combating disasters, but also his rejection of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan to 8 thousand euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Legalization of euthanasia and suicide with a side-by-side approach is needed, the Committee of Experts states
Canadians refuse to die, approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors are working together to ensure the best palliative care, and this is not a case of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the findings of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code in order to permit suicide with the assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed under circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given birth to a culture in which people are afraid to dispute the subject of death”.
Because of medicalization or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with the assistance of the authors of the report, it is concluded that it is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and suicide with the assistance of the side.
Now, according to experts, who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been lawfully or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization has been abused, i.e. euthanasia or suicide with the assistance of persons who cannot or do not wish to take such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during the Joselin Downi teleconference, which presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide by side is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Joselin Downey.
Canadian Antiquities
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia, because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe that this will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66 per cent believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of older people or persons with disabilities is less valuable.
With regard to those who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those questioned believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should provide that legal cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals learn in a spirit of respect for the refusal of medical care at the end of their life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to a palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it is not used for physical pain, such as euthanasia, and subject to the same limitations.
Comments of other experts
Some health law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mt. Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “tertiary” because, among other things, it did not restrict the use of euthanasia in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says Met. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Desham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to be independent of all other values that constitute the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Sommerville also stated “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as “a euthanasia manifesto”.
Margaret Sommerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with the assistance of a lateral legalization, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus condemns the "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Assad's parties held a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar Assad, who, with Russia's support, resisted it and condemned the "agreement" against his country.
Two days after the withdrawal of Syria from the League of Arab States, the European Union stepped up sanctions against Damascus, and the Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan resigned President Assad.
The King of Jordan Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call President Bashar Assad to power in Syria, where about forty civilians and military personnel were killed.
"If Bashar were to be in the best interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their wishes lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enhancement of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course in relation to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 armed forces have been killed in the Derra region of southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy guns in Jobara in the occupied town of Homs, according to the NGO.
At the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Valid Muallem, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to eliminate Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, and he added that the plot against Syria would fail.”
Following his decision to exclude Syria from the League of Arab States, he is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the intervention of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Allen Giuseppe, also spoke of sending observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabata to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the fighting cities and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League ' s " wrong" decision, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time for markets and victims of Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for some time to set up their team and implement a programme that would require “victims” to restore the credit lost in the last few months of the Berlin government.
The former European Commissioner had been involved yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups who participated in the discussions after meeting with the candidate as Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Jean-Fini, said he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote in confidence by Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monty of a limited list of dozens or around that minister head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders, asking for time.
When “democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme, he stressed that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the sudden fall of industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should have formed a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Jean-Finnie, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that by joining the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important figure in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not comply with the 2013 budget, in spite of the tight economy in recent months, called for, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marcelya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on relaunching the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the home affairs of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented "the change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor", symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the authors.
A great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid the early elections, as by April 2012, Italy would have to make public debt payments of €20,000.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
Russian scientist Wiacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday the American Atomic Hazard Specialist Agency.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the possible military aspect of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, “since the 1960s, at the Soviet nuclear centre in Chelabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic explosives”.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to create a company producing nanoalmase in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 until his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA refers to “clear signs that Iran’s development of nuclear detonators has “facilitated the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career in this technology within the framework of his country’s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes has increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence have or have not changed slightly during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to 49 per cent, compared to the increase in 13 per cent of cases of Catholic violence, the decrease in 4 per cent of attacks on Jews and the total increase in the number of crimes on a religious basis.
The total number of hate crimes reported by the FBI increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the decrease in 2009, concerns arise that the number of these crimes is increasing again, the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in an official communication.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as serious violations of human rights,” added one leader of Paul Legandr.
“The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes,” he adds, thinking that this can be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law is the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes Facebook-like
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed its platform to allow users to see, among other things, the activity of those who monitor what this service is doing on Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "names" tab allow you to track more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", the internet users whose messages ("twitas") you track, and those who follow yours.
This gives the opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested “by a small percentage of users in August” before going out in broad use across the network on Monday, AFP said to secretate Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather unfavourable and as using rather unclear terms (RT for someone else's overcrowding, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is largely gratifying to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, representing users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users discussed this innovation using tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, imperative, and a scarf reminds Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Implementation of the golden rule of the budget
The leader of the large coalition of social democrats and Christian Democrats, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down a budget “gold rule” in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reductions in the public credit rating agencies of Austria (Third A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with Austria's public debt being 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the ceiling threshold of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If the ability of Austria to pay only one item, from AAA to AAA+, we would have to pay per cent for three thousand euros more each year, the Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger argued.
Austria thus met the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State and Government required a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equal law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt the “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, since 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year and land, like municipalities, should be balanced budgets.
The aim is to make the public debt to decline below 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
threatens with a new intervention in the currency market
Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would undertake new interventions in the currency market if their value continued to grow.
We are interfering with how we did this last time, if we believe that the exchange rate is excessive, Mr. Nod Senate has explained.
On Tuesday, Yena grew almost before the historic note, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to a large extent to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new power record since 1945.
But since then the Yen has been growing steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a "place of refuge" in these sad times of economic downturn around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar dropped below 77 yen and the euro dropped below the symbolic plank in 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was approximately 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth in Japanese currency is damaging to Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies because of foreign exchange conversion.
“Japan is fighting to restore itself” after the earthquake and tsunamis of 11 March, which devastated the Tohok region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill the fragile birth of reconstruction.
Third in the world, the economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic indicators”.
Minister of Finance Dean Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the bond.
However, the Deputy Managing Director of Hirohid Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps”, implying that no further mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of fines by 5,000 million yen (EUR 47,000) by raising to 55,000 million yen (519 million euros) the amount it allocates to purchases of various financial instruments to satisfy the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates increase, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchange went on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trades at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London dropped by 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in paying credit to countries in difficult circumstances, the global fund markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"The concerned investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts with a view to Europe ' s ability to hold back the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has pursued its view of Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in the corridor of close changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized," says Michiyoshi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern to the future eurozone is based on a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
Euro reached its lowest score in half a month.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS on Monday, in which a resolution was adopted, which provided, inter alia, for the country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of fear.
This morning, the income of the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the income of the Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent on Tuesday.
These complexity with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fear of participants.
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, has requested the exchange of time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be “the main task” of his Government.
Spain was under the influence of the markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
A new historical peak was reached between the interest rates on Germany and Spain ' s 10-year debt obligations.
Waiting for growth in Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected by 0.3 per cent, due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the second quarter by 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany has, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first euro area assessment is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject on which a decision cannot be taken after a short discussion or under emotional influence, it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are the reason for thinking about the share and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and on sound data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the demand for electricity by 2050 unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing resource shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue the production of electricity on a continuous basis, without forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalance, the theme that had disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one plant to its set by rebuilding the station that was interrupted after an accident in Tri-Mill Island.
Although the model of Germany, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the validity of the argument contradicts that argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, by a leap in carbon dioxide emissions from the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these adverse effects will be felt.
Denmark’s example should be considered.
The European Turbine Construction Championship, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest coal and gas user due to a break-in wind, resulting in carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices of 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher respectively than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since the globalised energy price economy is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment services in the national territory, French companies benefit from cheap electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a significant increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful statements about our country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is more because they do not object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 people in the middle.
It is highly export-oriented, attracts a whole range of international trade-related small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France had decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to contribute a large number of these enterprises and lose €6,000 million a year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will be ordered by EPR to work for sixty years if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to solve the energy equation, it should be recognized that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France we have a security body that conducts uncompromising and transparent monitoring of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has survived three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental impact
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
Some people in Fukushima seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The result of this step and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all the energy specialists wishing to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors by clearing their way to gaining leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is also necessary to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and pre-emptive manners to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicola Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties -- the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, subject to the figures policy and the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was an administrative concern for foreign students, which was released when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talent, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree in many ways.
On the right-hand side, Jack Shirac said in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people will not become a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left, Michel Rocar, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world”.
Varieties of generosity only
In 2005, fear of invasion of the country was felt both by the Polish plumber and by the right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they allow immigrants to display.
In his programme, François Holland has limited itself to banalities, saying that “cooperation will solve our immigration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give the electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book, which summarizes the latest data on immigration (Special People: How migration formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University edition, 352 C.E.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restriction of immigration has led to a decrease in growth and employment.
Fears of the impact of immigrants are based on the assumption that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, with reduced wages.
However, experience has shown that in reality immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing local labour by performing work that lacks local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled are in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the interaction between local and immigrants would have a positive impact on local workers ' wages.
Jovanny Perry calculated that the increase in migration flows by 1 per cent resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
And that is not to say that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of natural immigrants among the Nobel Prize winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also have a net profit in social security systems, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany, at the age of 30 years, will make a net profit to the public budget (income minus expenditure) of an average of EUR 150,000.
Nikola Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was meeting with " teeth" to get into the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to frighten immigrants, had an opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be understood
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; yet, at the same time, it is fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that democracy would ultimately be a threat to its enemies, that it would be enough to put a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, "Malgo" has known what's happening from the surface of the thought.
The universal vote, although a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a "depression tool," as some philosopher-republican Stephen Yourro had said.
No, democracy also requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinody of a true and false Greek referendum would have a double-exposure effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality has to be designed to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight against democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now not on the side.
We do not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or a pair of legs tied to a nationalism -- what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are dreaming, not of a cast of guillotine, but of a joint, clear and uninterrupted choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and there is no knowledge of how many more crises they will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - a crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to market and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
All of Europe is completely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project under the sovereignty of the people must be restored urgently.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the debt burden of everyone, to get rid of the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in them.
The outcome of the crisis will require solutions at the European level and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delores are all now demanding the European Economic Government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration of citizens is a regular madness and a new stupidity.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" the Republicans.
The revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still in effect.
We must build a Europe that is united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level of this people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Uncontacted chips are spreading.
The World Map is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will result in 11 per cent increase in world sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM telephones), with over 6 million units reported by Eurosmart.
The most important sector of non-contact technologies, which allows public transport or purchases to be paid, is simply a map of the receiving device.
This year, 460 million homeless chips will be sold in the world against 320 million years earlier!
Their share will rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10 per cent of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already provided with this function and are received by 75,000 terminals.
France is beginning with a more modest position: 400,000 visa-free cards are available.
But big stores are growing.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million contacts without Pass MasterCard.
To move at a higher speed, banks must provide their customers with equipment.
“Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute bank cards for their clients that are suitable for offline use in the future,” said Jérar Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments by mobile phone.
But this is just the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
Until only a few devices are equipped with the NFC technology (neighbourly field communication) necessary for such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they're supposed to be flying next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 clients and staff with stamps providing no contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch a bid to enable its customers to pay by mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Friday, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria Abdelkader Messahel even stated that the Algerians were now convinced of this.
“The way in which these two organizations are used and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without being involved in detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
The investigation of the abduction of two Frenchmen in Nigeria in January found two binding ties.
The people kidnapped at the Niamey restaurant near Aqmi, Antoine de Leukur and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the next day, along with several of the kidnappers during the operation by the French Special Forces.
Among the remains of the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sim cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
An analysis of the phone calls was made to several interviewees in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Majdiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram collaborators, and the other to a man, allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt more reliable evidence to be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident through the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortars and the increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in head with Washington is now putting pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The case was that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed the group as a community of educated people who were not interested.
Immediate success
Founded in 2002 in Majdiguri at the mosque, school, and with a fundamentalist Mohammed Yusufe, Boko Haram - which means that Western education is a sin - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It has been politicized and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the corrupt central government.
It is mainly aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram demonstrated special activity by attacking many police offices.
Abuji's reaction is usually uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern velvet.
In the past Christmas she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja Boko Haram, the first attack by the killer on a strengthened police headquarters was organized.
In August, the United Nations will have its first international mission.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now worrying all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Nigeria and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, in talks with President Gudlak Jonathan Allen Jumpe, he warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
World, as the Republican candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romni, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America’s weakened crisis bring about a complex world with simple and more accurate ideas?
If candidates were to be heard by the presidents of the Republicans, voters could believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud but lacking details of the statement on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong part of the republic.
Lozungs relating to China, Iran and assistance to Israel are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romni, who has the best chance of leaving the Old Good Party, threatened to complain to the Chinese at WTO and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency," is a sensitive topic for America, upset by the migration of its entire industry to Asia.
The worse it is, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama to China, and the only candidate in the complex foreign policy, was unable to combat the attitude that fueled emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama).
But Huntsman, who's holding in the lower part of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan-style
Romania also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance by accusing Obama of not fulfilling his pledges to the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of the case.
He recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has already owned it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug addicts.
To resort to the torture of suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009, Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman are also recommended.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKain, who is heavily involved in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce the tone for combating terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the early conclusion of the "defense" from Iraq, his capture in Libya, which brought him to his reputation as a weak politician.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security at Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that connects to sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be redesigned economically to restore its leadership, Obama rights.
The North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
Gas pipeline North Stream, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
It's based on the gas supply equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between the opening of the orchestra and the dining room, in the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that directly unites Russia and Germany under water.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fijon and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte have together returned a symbolic valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
According to the new pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will enter Western Europe each year at the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad area from the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline must be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all of France ' s consumption.
And the possibility of a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project encountered fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the Warsaw debate, there was no stopping before the North Stream was compared with the new German-Soviet Pact, which aimed at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But the price of losing Europe's energy is because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has been able to achieve its understanding of a direct union between Russia and rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already at the forefront.
"This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," said François Fijon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which the gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Ljubmine, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical breakthrough.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel locked in concrete to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, mines remaining since World War II had to be circled.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, North Stream Press Secretary.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe wire is a long metallic snake with an equal weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, with no cracks all over its length, no valves and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not aware that the Russian public company would settle on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cross the gas stream less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So, in the case of a gas leak contained in the gas pipeline, it will go into the air.
But this seems to be unlikely designers who designed wires that are calculated only once every 100,000 years.
The control of the status of the pipeline will be carried out by a submarine that covers the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus operating inside the pipeline.
The cigarette-shaped apparatus is inserted within the tube tube with a diameter of 1 metre and moved forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it shall provide accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
Gas circulation is only carried out by pressure.
It consists of 200 bars at delivery and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the capital.
Others are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunia and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies established a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a pipeline.
His headquarters is in Zug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the full amount of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Mueller.
Gas pipelines were financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and by 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of work will be 7.4 million euros per two pipelines.
GDF Suez's investment will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will bear their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubin on a sandy shore planted with pine trees.
The four-metre-high valves form the exhaust terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
In full power, it will be 3 million an hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brandy
Moleskine, created by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will taste the letter.
He has the aroma of adventures, the hours of the letter at the light of the candle.
Moleskine's block is easy to find on a straight-angle black cover, on a trimming, on a yellow-white page, like a timer.
However, Moleskine's book, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is located in Milan, decided to sell design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s former consultant, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The block is inspired by the old manufacturing technique, the molasses, the lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the sketches.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was cultive for art-avvantgardes until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager brand in Mode Modo.
Good luck.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales grew by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first few years when all 3,000 blocknotes were produced.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and was exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
The profile of the typical buyer is difficult because the block is equally attractive to businessmen, students and people of a free profession.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notes in Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns and has gained extensive knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter, despite the e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by Moleskine's development; the brand recently organized a “Environment Road” exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also started coverings with a Leopard drawing on the case of a film festival in Locarno.
Using its achievements and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, handles, bags for computers. Brand includes all types of support.
The success that led to this is that in October 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Syntegra Capital, which added a new page to Moleskine's history.
Why is unemployment among people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled remains twice as high as the average, which is 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
It's curing?
“No,” says Eric Blanche, Director General of Adapt, who organizes a week's employment for disabled people.
"A great deal of progress has been made in 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 times as much as 3 times as that."
"There's a lot more work going on."
It has to be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for disabled people.
Among them are older: 37 per cent older than 50 years (17 per cent on average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have the degree of baccalaureate and 2.3 million higher education students have only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and which are essential to the problem," said Christian Grapen, Director General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but it's too slow.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprenere on Cité’s order showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented themselves as total people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities, as set out in the Act adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 amount to 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised taxes, put strong pressure on the company," explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 persons with disabilities have 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199.
Azar: "How lucky."
Before meeting with the Blues on Tuesday (20.45) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We're not going to come here to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stadium of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar were at peace.
Five months after his attacker left against Turkey, a Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures Lila.
That before the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the assembly, that's the whole thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Lilly for a year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to make my eyes."
Left in the reserve, in advance of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azhar came to St.D. to finally "blow".
Remember, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 years and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them," he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the particular character of the match.
And especially that which is on the other side, Mother, and John, and Adil.
"Our roads just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "glorious."
"Pride" to play "the holiday match."
"Glorification" is also claimed as "neighbor," that France "was once again a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nice.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical sportsman will fly on one plane with the lead of the blues... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, the games are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paul Bentu, is launching its response match against Bosnia (22.00 a.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Bent has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the Assembly, which has been in its role since September 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to play, and Bosnia to win.
Given the 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the promised goal that would calm it down.
"That's a good result, but it's a risk."
But they have, on their brightly lit de la Lus stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the audience, who must be in the heat, though the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but discretionary Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of Euro 2012," said the successor of Carlos Cairo.
No one in the match against Bosnia on Friday demands victory from the Portuguese.
No one could set up Bosnians.
"That's a good result, but there's a risk that Bent regrets.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical dignity and players with a lot of individual dignity," he added.
As was the case in Zenice, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
That's a good idea, but this time it would be realistic.
