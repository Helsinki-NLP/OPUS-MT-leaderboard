You're driving slowly.
You are learning Irish.
You are our only hope.
You are reading.
You are reading.
That's how you'll fall!
I'm sorry.
It's your friend Tomás.
You're watching.
Welcome to Rohat.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You are writing.
You are writing.
Your friend is here.
Your mother lives in the Gaeltacht.
You run.
You should finish the work.
You should ask him.
You talk.
You understand me.
You have three cups of coffee.
You would enter that position.
