You're cooking.
You're cooking.
You're driving slowly.
You are learning Irish.
You are our only hope.
You are reading.

That's how you'll fall!
I'm sorry.
It's your friend Tom√°s.
You're watching.
Welcome to Rohat.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

Your friend is here.
Your mother lives in the Gaeltacht.
You run.
You should finish the work.

You talk.
You understand me.
You have three cups of coffee.
You would enter that position.
