Bosniaks protest Croatia's plans for the storage of radioactive waste
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad asked Croatia to charge waste storage plans in former military trash in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared the fight against the project.
The facility would contain waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosniaks, who hold banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – ( river) Una needs us", said that the storage of radioactive waste could endanger the Union river and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO.
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, mayor of the municipality of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also part of Croatia.
Representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage issues.
Croatian public television HRT stated on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided whether to build waste storage on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with using institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes for a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country of ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country near the power plant.
"Why does Croatia say that this is the best place to trade in Bosnia?" Drljac asked.
We can't let them be humiliated!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
Congress of the United States for the 15 days following the approval by the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multitasking fishermen did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I do not see any major obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior counsellor for Washington Defence Policy, a conservative Heritage Foundation tank.
The expert explained that on the basis of the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad for 15 days prior to the signing of the agreement, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of sale of weapons to a NATO Member State, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fishermen by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the US armed group Lockheed Martin and his subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A group of fishermen Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of U.S. fishermen of the fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish authorities were submitted by Mariusz Błasčkak, Minister of Defence in May.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of this year at the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy and President Donald Trump in the White House.
Upon completion of this agreement, if finalized, representatives of the Pentagon will be guarded under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot Antiractic System.
The price of one F-35 fisherman at the time of Poland's submission of the purchase offer was around $89.2 million – without weapons and technical assistance.
As the US military experts, who wanted to remain anonymous, informed the PAP that such a price was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices fall sharply, currently the price of one F-35 is below $80 million, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, which does not have the advantage of F-35," said Venable.
The PAP spokespersons hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of U.S. warplanes by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – or offset – will be discussed directly with US fishermen’s F-35 producers.
What is the alternate Münchhausen team on Netflix?
Caregivers and parents with the above disorder pretend their healthy child is sick.
The "Payton Hobart Choices" show hits the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but first he must be president of the student self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gweneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the show, he discusses the subject of the Münchhausen team – a mental illness that occurs in caregivers who behave as if a healthy person who has been affected by a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this disease, e.g. the Munich team that is responsible for the symptoms of the disease.
The Deputy Münchhausen team is in simulation that the person who remains under our care has certain comforts.
It's also called an invented and caused disease, and it's treated as violence against the child.
It is a rare disease that usually includes a parent who is experiencing symptoms or causes symptoms, so it seems that his child is sick.
What are the symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Convinced that a child who looks healthy, however, feels poor.
Respiratory or mediastinal disorders.
Fake the results of treating the child as sick, e.g. passing glucose to urine samples to make it appear that the child has diabetes.
Symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children the necessary medicines and other substances.
How often does the Münchhausen replacement team occur?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of the disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people occurred in more than two years.
What should be done if the child is suspected of being in danger?
Contact the local special services department or call the NSPCC child protection info line, choosing number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid to school in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – The State Police Department in Kaduna conducted a raid yesterday at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal school, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi's self-government area, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were living in highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities denied that claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there for the parents ’ approval, ” said a resident who serves for Shehu, a high - school preacher.
Before the children were admitted to school, their parents signed a form.
Parents brought their children food every day, and they knew what conditions they were in.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as by the removal of all the food provided by the parents before the school closed.
It's not okay because parents can testify that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of Police Abdurrahman, who had visited the school once to check the level of child care, never had reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.
However, a police officer for Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, admitted that when children were transferred to the government, they would join their parents.
‘They shall be kept under dehumanising conditions in the name of submission or acquisition of framework knowledge.
Many of them had twins on their backs, which proves they were bitos.
That's why we're studying the school to get to know her owner," he added.

Most Poles want the release of the Chief of the Supreme Court of Control Marian Banasis – a result of the Cantar survey for TVN.
To the question "Should you believe that the head of NIK Marian Banas should give up", 55% replied "yes" - including 34% marked the option "decisively yes", and 21% said "yes" instead.

Following disclosure of the material, Banas said that on 27 September he would be on a free leave until the completion of the control of his CBA's assets statements.

Seimonika: Tusk or Kidawa-Blońska will be president
"I think Donald Tusk and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrej Duda," says Tomasz Seimonik.
Vice-President of the Citizens' Platform Tomasz Siemoniak in his conversation with Polsat News spoke about an affair with the head of NIK.
“This case is disconcerting for Marian Banasis.
He can be the Minister of Culture from some entertainment, not the head of NIK, or the Minister of Finance.
No one responsible for the billions, for the taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemonyk also talked about the candidacy of Claudia Jachira.
“The PiS list contains Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who wasn't just saying things, he was just doing them.
He judged the former heads of the KICs for spying on Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal that Antonie Macerevich be on the list?" he asked.
“People of us young people have different aesthetics.
I think Jachira, who's already apologized for one thing, also feels that sometimes she's overreacting.
Let's not deal with this campaign problem," he added.
Tourists after the fall of the travel office Neckermann Poland are planning to return to the country
As the government said, there was no need to bring tourists before time.
"The Authority shall pay successively out of the insurance guarantee unpaid hotel places," was stated.
On September 25th, the travel office of Neckermann Polska filed a declaration of insolvency in the Marshallese office.

On Friday, the next 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece will return.
Tourists will arrive at Katowice and Warsaw (in total it will be five charter flights).
Some of them will return by flight.
On the weekend – as planned – about 1000 tourists must return to the country on holiday, including Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy.
As a result of the information provided by the Marshallian Voivodeship Office, the travel agency sold around 20,000 trips during the autumn-winter season.
"These travel agency customers should contact the insurance company Allianz Partners directly," the government reminded.
He added that "the situation of tourists who reported problems in hotels at the moment seems to be stabilized and the occurrence of incidents of withdrawal of tourists from hotels has been resolved with consular services".
Last Friday, the largest authority, along with Thomas Cook's oldest travel agency, reported that it was on the brink of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100% of the shares in Neckermann Polska.
"Sweet" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masked suit, a man caught a 12-year-old from the back of school and dragged her into a dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers held a number of important items for investigation.
The man has been guilty of seven assault-related charges and three other cases of assault and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked in the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw how suddenly she had come out of her arms with a great throat and a knife.
When she begged "stop, stop, stop," she grabbed her neck and forced her into the growth.
The man said: “Don’t yell.
Don't yell because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and feet with cable bands and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man got to work around 9.30, not responding to a few text messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and he carried traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed that he was taking part in an attack of rage on the road while chasing another driver in the bushes and fell off his couch.
A further trial of the guilty man will take place on Tuesday.
Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the benefit of the common
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technological firms, diplomats and financiers that, with the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, there is a risk of increasing social inequalities if, in its course of ethics, the good of common sense is not taken into account.
Pope Francis delivered these words at a conference in Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference entitled "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This triennial event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in the debate on the perspectives and dangers of artificial intelligence.
It discussed the technological achievements of war art and the future of work, which will play an increasingly important role, and discussed the case study of Christchurch's attacks in New Zealand and the decisions taken by companies owned by the social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his talks at the pope's conference, Franciszek praised the potential for technological progress, noting that machines have been saved by dangerous and monotonous workers at the beginning of the industrial revolution.
However, he warned that increasingly dependent on the machines to achieve profits is the risk of people being deprived of their dignity at work.
"If technological progress were to cause more and more visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of humanity were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an unwanted inaction to some kind of barbarity of the most powerful law-enforcement.
The conference organisers expressed the hope of taking advantage of the expertise of the participants and identifying potential future advisors of the Catholic Church in high-tech matters.
Martin Odegaard, a racing player from Real Madrid, makes fans in the euphoria his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at the opening target of Michael Oyarzabal.
Winning 2:0 with Ossuna, Real Madrit climbed to the top of La Ligi table and continues to pass unbeatable on his own battlefield this year.
However, despite not counting any defeats in this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under tremendous pressure as a result of the stormy preseasonal and public battle with the Vale Star, Garethe Bale.
The situation reached the point where Real Madrid was humiliated in the League of Champions by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madryt have real talent – some of them the French now have plans, others do not.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Realu Madryt and currently plays in the team.
However, this Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to the Real Sociedad, caused a huge move, including an incredible assistant in the La Ligi game.
During the meeting Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist at the opening goal of Michael Oyarzabal and the Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 in front of his own sight.
After taking the ball from the right-hand side, Martin Odegaard set up a player from the opposite team, setting up a net for him, and then sending an amazing injection of centimeters between two other players and his teammates just left to deliver his leg.
The second gate of Willian Jose and the third in the performance of the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the execution, provided a decisive victory for Imanola's subsidiary before Man Garcia was sent out of the pit five minutes before the game ended.
Martin Odegaard joined Realu Madrid as only 16 years old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel safe on the battlefield.
Anna Hazare surprised to see Sharada Pawar's name for the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra
Anna Hazare stated: “The name of Sharada Pawara did not appear on the list when this matter was given to me”
The Social Actor, Anna Hazare, was not surprised by the fact that the name Sharada Pawara, president of the Nationalist Congressional Party, NCP, appeared in connection with a multimillion-dollar fraud in the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra.
The Investigation Agency Executive Directorate, in short ED, filed a case against Sharad Pawar, his brother Ahit Pawar – former Deputy Prime Minister of Maharashtra – and others in connection with the fraud.
Information report of the Executive Directorate on the case, corresponding to the FIR Police Report, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on the FIR report of the Mumbai Police, which lists the names of the former bank president, Ajita Pawara, and 70 former employees of the financial institution.
When it came to me, the name of Sharad Pawar was nowhere to be seen.
“How did his name come out, who gave it, only they know these things” – Anna Hazare said on Thursday when asked about the matter of ED and said the connection of Sharad Pawar with fraud.
Anna Hazara, a critical assessor of Sharad Pawara, expressed the hope that the truth would come to light as a result of the ED's detailed investigation into fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption event.
Sharad Pawar refuses to commit a criminal offence and claims that he was in no way connected with the bank, as well as points out the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the elections of the General Assembly in Maharashta scheduled for October 21.
The former Minister of the Union ensured that he would not lay down the state of Delhi, clearly referring to the central government of the BJP.
The NCP considered the Executive Directorate's case to be politically motivated.

Is that the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, serious illness, child death.
It's dramas that cause a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God wanted so."
Does the Creator send us misfortunes and diseases?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father was terrified to leave the room.
"My son has no hands or legs!" he cried to the doctor.
Their parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that removed their limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But after four months of prayer, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujicic is known worldwide as an evangelizer and a motivational speaker, making many people turn to him.
"I'm proof that God is never wrong," says Nick.
“When suffering touches us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for a reason.
We ask, "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God rules the whole world and directs our lives, then of course the question arises whether He has sent us a disease, a misfortune..."
Mother confesses to murdering two teenage sons
The woman burst with tears when she was told that she could spend the rest of her life in prison after she confessed to murdering her two teenage sons and planning to kill the other four of her children.
Sarah Barrass, 35 years old, confessed to the murder of Tristan Barrass (13 years old) and Blake Barrass (14 years old).

Ambassador PO Krzysztof Breezy of Caesar Gmiz
"In connection with the campaign of written lies, I make an appeal to Caesar Gmiz," the post of PO Krzysztof Brejz reported on Twitter.
The reason for the call is the statement by Cézar Gmiz's publicist in the program "The Missing 20" on the TVP antenna.
One of the leaders of SokomzBuraka is Krzysztof Breiza, who has a lot of experience in organizing the hate department.
"People who know Mariusza Kozaka-Zagozdė – founder of the "heiterski" profile – are Kierwinski, Budka and Gerethy," said Gmiz.
SokzBuraka are social pages and profiles with political-related memes and jokes.
As the "Networks" say, there is PR Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda behind the profile.
"We have been able to find out that since April Br. Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw City Office, at the marketing office," he wrote a week.
"Confederation" in Olaw
At the auction in Olava, the electoral committee organized the “Confederation”.
The program was presented by Krzysztof Shokalski number 5 on the list, and by Halška Bieeckka number 9.
The announced leader of the Krzysztof Tuduj list did not reach the election.
The candidates have raised many problems – from excessive government fiscalism to health care problems.
The issue of the economic zone has also been raised, which should act for all entrepreneurs, rather than favouring foreign capital.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisor in connection with a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC Police Procedure Authority shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation with the Prime Minister explaining whether, during the conduct of the public office as mayor of London, it has been permitted to commit criminal offences.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated that its supervisory inspector had registered the "question related to the proceedings" of the prime minister in connection with complaints of preferential treatment of Arcuri resulting from their close knowledge.
"A question relating to proceedings" can be said when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
It doesn't mean it's been proven in any way.
IOPC is now considering whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against police officers in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police station because Johnson was then acting as an appropriate police commissioner and a criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied it as if any irregularities had occurred because of his close relationship with Arcuri.
He said earlier that he would apply to the order of the London City Council and report details on his relationship with Arcuri, but he relied on the Council to "get on the wrong problem".
The order follows the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, headed by Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 for Arcuri’s Hacker House.
The government is waiting for a difficult question about the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the funds.
Minister of Digitization Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that his department's employees "usually maintained proper care" and that the company had a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the number was transferred to the California office, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is currently living.
The close relationship between the prime minister and businesswoman "was a secret police officer for staff".
The GLA decision to direct the case to the independent IOPC Police Procedure Authority met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to a higher-ranking source, the government's representative is a "politically motivated attack", and its deadline, before the Conservative Party conference, is "clearly political".
"The supervisory inspector has not provided any supporting evidence of the charge and the prime minister has not been given the opportunity to reply before the press release late Friday evening," the source says.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to resort to such a clearly political law.
Today, in earlier hours, journalists "The Standard" were told that Johnson's close relationship with California's businesswoman, who was assisted by the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was "a polyschinel secret" for workers.
The employees of London & Partners (L&P) were listed above and reminded that Arcuri was given the place during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor despite the fact that her company was not considered "reliable" at the time.
Third case of drug offences related to the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the recent death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter suspects the sale of fentanyl-made fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based fentanyl-based pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of the accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for the “epidemia”, which swallowed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter's indicting the delivery of the pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter all over August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected of playing the role of Walter's "curier" who provided Pettyt's pills.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in their case.
Walter, who has been subject to a conditional release on drugs since 2005, is under arrest and has been further sentenced to five months in violation of the conditions of release.
Prosecutors dealing with the case, which they first brought to the TMZ Celebrates website on Thursday, claim that Walter remains in custody awaiting trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the accused's escape.
The response to the message left to the Automotive Secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was placed in federal court on September 4th, and his defender refused to comment.
The word of Roman art Miller is a sincere talk about his depression and the use of drugs, so he got fans from among the biggest hip-hope stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was actually called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he left behind an Ariana Grande singer who was finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published a moving film with Miller's participation and the song "Thank U Next", in which she mentioned him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been associated with opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist of the 3 Doors Down team, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and his body found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article has been amended: Walter's correct spelling is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian makes more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun in the hidden using a free Scratch 2 application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
So far Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
In today’s game, there is a bat that is hiding in accordance with the program.
The player gets a point every time he catches a bat that comes out of the hideout.
I've learned to play at an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote him on a 50-day accelerated course for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
The course, organised by Codefest International, was designed to provide children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robots and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always picked up the phone and played on it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games grew when he was 7 years old and got a storm for spending all the time on games.
"One day he was playing on the tablet as usual, and he was so absorbed that I became upset," said his father.
I said, "You're still just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so that others can play them?"
Speaking those words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
From then on Basil showed an active interest in the science of creating his own games, persuaded his parents to buy a laptop and write it on a course during which he knew the basics of creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his game a title based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in the Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population has leadership in continent innovation.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were praised for using codes to create robots separating their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the female high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots to stack boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on the right path to the career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina admitted to lying about corruption
From the documents submitted on Friday, it follows that the President of the Republican Party in North Carolina has admitted that he has lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes' novelty, he's going to admit his guilt in the next Wednesday.
A document containing a factual basis, prepared under the defence agreement and signed by Lawyer Hayes, shows that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI investigating corruption agents in 2018.
The defendant's agreement has been sealed, and the fact is, there is no evidence that Hayes' allegations are admitted to.
He was initially charged with conspiracy, corruption and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in the plan of the insurance company's authorities to send taxes on the campaign to the head of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two colleagues were accused of trying to re-acquire Mike Causey's State Insurance Commissioner.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, one of the main state political donors in recent years, which since 2016 has transferred more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but he also gave taxes to the Democrats.
His lawyer didn't respond to Friday's e-mail message with a comment request.
Defense officer Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to Friday's e-mail message requesting a comment.
From Friday's court documents, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about the state workers of the Insurance Department.
According to the document containing Hayes' actual basis, he actually talked to the insurance Commissioner about changing the staff employed by the market regulator at Lindberg's request.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about catching directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance business and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the causey's new campaign in 2020.
The action in question shows that the contract also includes a request for a change from the departmental officer who controlled Lindberg.
The future Republican Causey reported a reported attempt to corrupt federal agents and helped them collect evidence of the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's partner ordered Hayes to hand over $250,000 to Causey's campaign during a conversation in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During Hayes' conversation, he initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but, as a result of the accusation, he finally withdrew.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's spokesman did not respond to the e-mail message requesting further information on the agreement.
Drivers will go with the first piece of a new dig.
From Saturday, drivers will be able to take advantage of the first of the three built mountain sections of the express road S7 – the new Zakopaniki – from the Skomily White to Rabka Source and the next two-day main road to Chabówka.
As the Croatian Department of National Roads and Autostrad (GDDKiA) of the Directorate-General of National Roads and Roads (GDDKiA) informed on Friday, Ivona Mikrut is the first of three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubna to Rabka Source, which will be dedicated to use.
From more than six kilometers from the Skeleton White to Chabówka more than one third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, she was led on the highway.
There were seventeen of them, including the longest and tallest, counting kilometers of length and 50 m of height, and four small facilities on streams near the Skomielna.
The train was driven to Wadowice and Nova Sącz, to national road No. 28 and to the old passage of DK7.
From the next node, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 in the direction of the New Targ and the Buried, and to DK7 to Chyžýný and the border of the state with Slovakia.
There was a place for the service of MOPs.
The express road ends with the Zabornji node in Rabce Source, which was built about a kilometer of a two-day DK47 fragment in Chabówka and is included in the already existing two-day Chabówka – Rdzawka.
The section S7 Skomielna Biała – Radka Zrój and the new section of national road No. 47 of the main accelerated class (GP) from Rabka Skoielna Biała to Chabówka built Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The cost of the investment was about $615 million.
The quality assurance of the work carried out will be valid for 10 years.
Approximately 16.7 km of new Zakopianki fragment, including 15.8 km of expressive road parameters, was divided into three implementing sections, each with a personal performer: Lubien – Repair, Repair – Skoielna Biała and Skoielna Biała – Rabka Zrój.
The first section of the tunnel is conducted by Poland – the Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the ALTIS-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the Italian tunnel section – Astaldi, and the Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is nearly $2.5 billion.
Investment is co-financed by the European Union Funds under the Operational Infrastructure and the Environment Programme 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is over $1.3 billion.
The entire section consists of a total of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, viaducts, stacads) and a two-room tunnel with a length of 2.06 km.
According to the road manager's order, this year there will be a 7.6-km section of Lubien – Correction with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which drivers will limit the construction of the tunnel.
The last section, Fixa – Skomielna Biała with a length of about 3 km, the drivers will go in 2021, after the construction of a two-room tunnel with a length of about 2,06 km each chain.
Our goal is a state of well-being
"We are building a welfare state in Poland," said Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro.
He came to Szczecin to vote on the advice of Darius the Matecki, who was a candidate for the Sejm from the List of Rights and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish state of well-being strategy," the minister said.
“We want the Polish to make a lot better for their lives to be at a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well-educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to do so.
Our government has consistently implemented a programme for four years, which was committed to implement four years ago.
We said we'd introduce a 500 plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said it's impossible that this money just doesn't exist.
We proved that the money was and was, but PO did not care about the people they were going to meet."
Ziobro also recalled the children's factory and the thirteenth retirement – and that the fourteenth retirement is also planned.
In addition to 'disrupting national income sharing', PiS is a just state and economic development.
Money should not only be a big stream to the pockets of elected ones who have a good relationship with the establishment and the authorities, but should be equally common to the entire society – he said.
Emmanuel Macron supports Jacques Chirac
On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated his predecessor Jacques Chirac on his television performance; he called him a great Frenchman and a great man of state.
At 21 p.m., the lights on the Eiffel Tower were gone for the former president.
Former French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac died on Thursday morning at the age of 86.

"He was the husband of the state we loved, just as he loved us," said the president.
"Over 40 years in politics, Chirac's face was close to us.
And whether we shared his ideals, his battalion or not, we all recognized each other in this man.
Tonight is a night of gratitude for Jacques Chirac.
He did so much for the nation, for our values, for our brotherhood and forbearance," Macron continued.
He recalled that in 2003 Chirac opposed war with Iraq, which had no UN mandate, ran for peace in the Balkans, for stabilization and peace in Lebanon.
Before the TV show Macron went to the Paris Chirac apartment on the street de Tournon.

Part of Sopecki Street in Nisk after the construction
On Tuesday, September 24, it was delivered to the operation of the Sopocka street in Nisk.
The total value of this task was 803 thousand gold, of which 26,000 gold was funding from the FDS, while the remaining amount was its own contribution from the Netherlands and the Gmina and the City of Low.

Facebook with concern about users' self-esteem hidden to try a fan
As part of the first time in the world of the experiment aimed at improving the user's self-esteem, some Facebook users will soon not see a number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
The favors will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia as a result of a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a study on self-esteem and the opinions of mental health professionals that the fan can tend to compare with others.
"The clothes from many of the groups working with us on the fight against harassment, as well as organizations in the field of mental health, were really positive," Garlick said.
Removing this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of their content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more pleasant and not accepted as a rivalry – she said.
Garlick made sure that companies that are based on Facebook activity will still receive the same indicators and observations that they have yet to have access to.
She said it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no hint when the experiment ends and whether the change will be introduced on a permanent basis.
"Introductory user comments on the new rules in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Commenting on the place of the world experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that provides us with noble views indicating whether the new experience is valuable for those who use our services or not.
Common: Counsellors want what compensation for pilgrims
A member who is not currently commenting on the advice of the council to that metropolis Abpa Wacław Depo on the transfer of financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste economy during the pilgrimage season.
The city's asking for 1 zł from the pilgrims.
On Friday, he spoke at a press conference, including the leader of the Spring Robert Biedron, organized on the bright side of the Frequent Mountain of St Mary's Lady, Vice-President of the Council of the city and candidate for Sejm Lukasz Kot.
Kot informed that the day before the SLD council had voted in favour of the appeal to Abpa Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold city from each visiting Part of the Pilgrim – in support of the work of city services, municipal etc.
We accepted an appeal from Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up the pilgrims, find the city for the pilgrims.
“We ask you to transfer the symbolic gold from each pilgrim to the city’s budget.
With this city it will be possible to provide them with better conditions of stay in Czestochove," said the City Council Vice-President.
Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, who was asked to comment on the subject of the Metropolis, first prepared a few replies, but then asked, as he suggested, for abs. Depo's recommendation, to replace it with information on the content: "Before receiving the official position of the city council, we do not refer to the matter".
According to the project on the website of the Magistrate of Appeal to Abpa Depo, it concerns "the transfer of financial compensation for the town of Partochowa for the support of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the increasing number of pilgrims arriving in the Common Pilgrims and therefore increasing the costs of the management system of municipal waste during the pilgrimage season, taking into account the city's images among residents and residents, birds and birds, we wish, in the framework of the generally accepted canons, to offer participation of our common good, small native of the Commons, in the costs of handling the waste system," it is a fragment of the appeal.
"In order to maintain the purity of pedestrian trails moving at the same time from small infrastructure, i.e. external waste bins, we present a proposal for a symbolic sharing in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zł from the Pilgrim," wrote.
"In addition to participating in annual costs, which the city covers from its own resources, taking care of the purity and aesthetics of urban space, and in order to stress that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be spent on improving tourist infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of universally available public toilets," the Council said.
They noted that, in addition to financial issues, their proposal stems from a large number of people's reservations about the purity of the route through which pilgrims move.
"In view of the cleanliness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of the City of Commons calls on the Archbishop of the Wacław Depo of the Federal Metropolitan Police to transfer the financial compensation for the City of Commons for the support of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season," was repeated in the appeal.
According to information from the press office of Jasna Góra all year round, 834 000 people attended the shrine in 200 general Polish pilgrimages.
About 124,000 faithful people arrived in 255 footpaths.
More than 8.8 thousand people arrived in the partridges (133 groups) and 440 (16 groups) in the runaways.
A minor 20 people arrived at the shrine of the horse and over 170 pilgrims out of two groups – on the reels.
"News" TVP passed the Confederation in a survey description
According to Pollster's study, in the elections to the PiS Summit, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Left 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5% would be obtained.
The election threshold was even written on the “Super Express” portal for which the survey was conducted.
In the main edition of the “Notice”, describing the same survey, only the first four parties presented the results, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The Head of the Board of Directors, Edita Lewandowski, clearly stressed that only four committees exceeded the electoral threshold and would enter the Seimas.
TVP also showed the division of semantic mandates without taking into account the votes cast by the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
In commenting on this whole situation, Mr Bosak spoke of "public compromise in the matter of honesty towards society".
"They started from the password on "moral revolution", he recalled and said that this case is a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that “TvP News” in further actions against the Confederation shame Urban and Miknik”.
He also drew attention to the lack of legal reactions of journalists.
“But let us also look at those who are legally silent.
Those 'rights', 'independent', 'insubordinate'.
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they fought at night," he added.

Brother sentenced to life for the murder of honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star by means of a photo published in social services, was suppressed in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani social media star, Qandeel Baloch, was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the greatest "honorous murder" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing funny selfies – nice according to Western standards, but in a highly mysogynistic Pakistan considered to be provocative – was suppressed in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no voice of conscience for his actions and stated that he "of course" killed his sister and that her behaviour was "unacceptable".
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be acquitted by the higher court," he said.
Earlier Balocha's mother, Anwar Mai, informed AFP that she hoped her son would be executed.
"He's innocent.
She was my daughter, and she's my son," she said.
The murder of Baloch hit the heads of world information services and renewed the call for action against the so-called honour killings, in which victims – usually women – are killed for breaking patriarchal social rules.
Women were burned, choked, shot or stylized for sins such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family “a shame” by manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by a close bloodthirsty.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (debt) may seek forgiveness from the nearest victims.
Three months after the murder of Baloch, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether the murder will be considered an honorary crime remains in the judge's hands, which means that the murderers can theoretically resort to another motive and be acquitted.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially insisted that their son be shown no kindness at all.
However, the congregated think that they can also lose him, change their mind, and claim that they want his execution.
The international harassment caused by the murder led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and proclaim itself a loser with its parents, forcing the cause to move forward.
One of Baloch's most famous works is to offer to make a strip in front of the Pakistani cricket team and to wear a decoupled purple dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw it as a crucial restriction in a country where the attitude of Kim Kardashian can be seen as a courageous and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The roots of the "honorous" killings are in tribal social norms, which still dominate South Asia, and in particular they regulate the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations reported that the increasing violence has resulted in a double number of people living in northern and western Nigeria in the last four months to some 40,000 people.
The United Nations Refugee Agency has found that concern has created "a new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to bring new measures to $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamist Boko Haram group, which has been running north for decades, is not responsible for the latest attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, rapes, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy homes and stolen profits.
Army and police have been sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from the fight with Boko Haram and from the Islamic state of West Africa, which separated itself from its former group in 2016.
"Avians don't come with group names," he said.
They're coming for it with the beastly stories.
Most refugees move to neighboring Nigra.
In his statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, he said he expects more people to flee to Nigra in the coming months, along with a deteriorating security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of the man charged with the murder of a woman and 2 children
A new date is planned for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the act of the District Court in Polk County, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is charged with three first-degree murders, according to the authorities, with a false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't confess.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and his 5-year-old son in their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The legal acts show that the new date of the proceedings, i.e. 27 January, gives the representatives of both sides more time to prepare.
Officials of Immigration and Customs Services in the United States claim that Escobar-Orellana is illegally residing in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson in the face of the cabinet's rebellion to reduce requests for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the state around the prime minister, there is a growing concern that he will not have enough time to get more important concessions.
Boris Johnson faces the risk of a rebellion by the cabinet seeking to reduce requests for Brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations there was an impasse on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Brussels defined the proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "ineffective".
The Crown ministers expect EU decision-makers, led by German chief Angela Merkel, to offer a compromise in the form of a three-year deadline for the backstop mechanism to be criticised.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to meet the Prime Minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand from the Prime Minister the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominique Cummings, which is based on attempts to use bluff against the EU and the threat of leaving the Union without an agreement, and then accept offers made by the Union at the latest.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the second-hand verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday on the conclusion of the suspension of Parliament as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We'll never win the arithmetic in the Gmin Room, which works for our disadvantage.
The prime minister must now exert himself and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on the bench.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try and break the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May, unless everything else is said.
He said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin House."
There are numerous opportunities for her vote, and everything depends very much on the end of this topic.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In his essay, the Prime Minister of Tourism said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he fights with bullies in Scotland, checks the eggs in Wales and fights with citizens on the main streets of the city – everything in the world, as if he had already been campaigning for good."
The spokesman for the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement is still a long way off and added: "No one should be fooled: a very long way to reach an agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the Benna Act implementing the three-month delay of Brexit in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law is making it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the prime minister, along with his employees, is still trying to make progress through hard work.”
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how to operate the area for Ireland as a whole for food and living.
A dog with no nose or leg under Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The customer was supposed to be asleep.
But it's been prevented.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal since she first saw it.
"I initially had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided she'd take care of the bitch until someone didn't take care of her.
But no one's reported yet.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Eventually, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
“Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like her in the way she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said a woman.
In time, Bonnie became the star of social media.
On Instagram, more than 14,000 internet users are watching it.
Lorraine Kelly: I've been told I'll never make a career on TV with a loudspeaker.
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV bosses said that because of the accent of Glasgow, she "never will make a career" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year-old career in the television industry Kelly, age 59, admitted that before her first performance on the screen she felt "great frustration".
"I was only 25 years old and was very nervous," she said.
When I was working in BBC Scotland as a intelligence specialist, the chief of staff said that my accent on Glasgow would never lead to success on television.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the show before I took up office duties in Glasgow.
I'll never forget an interview with the star Bette Davis conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a live legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a local newspaper reporter in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then started running programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, to later start her morning program "Lorraine", which she took on her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program during which she will mention her best-remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long career on television is "pass and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "It must be hard to work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interested.
When she remembers the media reports that moved her emotions, Kelly says that "very difficult" for her was to relate the attack in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of murdered or wounded children were watching our program live with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place in silence, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, which I took part in.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannam shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "they really admire their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they have to bear the worst comments on the Internet trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30 at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
A senior state official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer to take over the president's office made up by the outgoing President Robert Mugabe at the top of the turn since he was afraid of imprisonment in order to confirm the military's acceptance in November 2017.
As last week brought "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwende the presidency's taking over during negotiations with the military during the coup.
However, a senior public official announced in the public media that Chiwenga did not reject the offer of fear, but because he had reviewed the Mugabe plan, which was used to prove to world leaders and the African Union (U.S.) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On the Twitter website, which confirmed that the 37-year-old Zimbabwean ruler wanted to hand over to Vice-President Chiwendz, and not President Emerson Munangagwa, Jamwanda 2, to which officials confirmed that he was a senior state official at the Office of the President and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there had been intense negotiations on this matter at that time.
The officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he realized that he was out of control.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president of the dead had, in the opinion of a senior state official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations was the spokesperson for President George Charamba, then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization of Aaron Nheper and the spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
Former bank chief Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-person mission to hand over President Chiwendze's offer, who was head of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who died more than his life as an icon of Africa tried to get an empty U.S. demeanor of military action by trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer, made by the then Chief of Defence (SSO) Mugabe, did not originate from the election.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing part of the deceased's family," wrote the official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of a political temptation that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a totally non-democratic way.
It is enough to recall that the commanders have stated that they have not packed and will not wrap up the constitutional order, which would have caused their conflict with the U.S. position on turnover.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would be coerced, violently interrupting the leaders' claims that they did not break the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly distracted by the whole situation and the way to fit it into its theoretical taxonomy of revolutions, would then have no choice but to describe it as a conversion, so the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit and with such a calculation that the offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had made the move when he realized that the defensive forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the wetman that he was risking a Caddafi-style lynch.
The military chiefs told him they wouldn't shoot the citizens if they moved to his residence, Blue Roof.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and prove that the army had taken over," the officer added.
The current SSO and the commanders read the assumptions correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who conveys this desperate message is given to understand, through a powerful metaphor, that we are not politicians or competitors at the political level, the state official has claimed a higher rank.
Officials tell the state that the army informed military commanders in the region through the attack that they were not going to pack Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding "criminals".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try Montenegro again to return from a short exile in the Republic of South Africa so that they could talk about change and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The people of the South African Republic, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional strength, but also because the then President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, was President Sadc – rejected the intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army is to enter Mugabe's house, as has been repeatedly feared in the background, the army of the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," said some informant.
China needs strong leadership or will "fall apart" as a political document states
The Chinese need a strong, sophisticated leader of the Communist Party, otherwise the country will "fall" – the government said in a document on the policy issued on Friday in the previous 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Press Office of the Chinese Government reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took over 70 years ago led the party.
China is occupying a large area, has complex national conditions, while there are rarely administrative difficulties here.
The document mentions that without China's unified and strong leadership, they will move towards divisions and decay, which will be disastrous for the world.
In solving the problems of the past, the Chinese authorities have applied hard-handed policies such as in the case of a mass of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping's strong hand, who will lead the second-year trades on Tuesday to the world economy since the adoption of the office by the end of 2012, has been further tightened up by the party's governments and has imposed sanctions on those who can question the authority.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme, which has brought this region to a standstill.
The document states that China is not trying to export its development model or to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not hegemony.
The Chinese have no control over the world.
In modern times China has been oppressed by great wetlands, and wars and unrest have left a deep impression on them as a result of the suffering they have suffered; China will never cause the other sufferings they themselves have experienced.
China rounds this anniversary in uncertain times for the country in the hot war with the United States and facing challenges due to the decommissioning economy, as well as anti-government protests in Hong Kong China.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to undermine their sovereignty.
Regarding the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and the continued increase in customs tariffs do not lead to problems".
China has matured the economy with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a large market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "war trade will never weaken it".
The Chinese are confident that they are able to face challenges, the crisis to change into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should look at China's development rationally, because China is not going to question the position of the United States or want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even less likely that they will stop China's development.
Restricting and weakening other countries and transmitting national disputes abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World of Jack Palkiewicz: Dubai, real faces
Dubai's emirate is still a place for seeking its own identity, scattered between the Bedouin tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extremism of progressiveness.
This leading new trends in the world's tourism leader arouses imagination and desires, leaving the emptiness of rich snobist hotels and attracting the fortunes of investors and traders to the status of the tax haven.
Websites infect with enthusiasm for this dream city, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated architecture concentration of the 21st century.
Emirates have risen to the rich in the sands of Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools hundreds of meters above the earth.
Many admire the universal pride, the appreciation of creative hyperactivism and the hysterical pursuit of avant-gardeness.
Here's the city whose motto says everything: "scramble, crush and tear".
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the thoroughness and contradiction of the metropolis took the dimension of the tandem grotesque. ”
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, totally dominated by the "Guinness Book of Records", an informal constitution of the Emirates.
Because everything here has to be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of an over-excessive and obscenity of something that is perhaps not transparent in old Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin, or Madrid, everyone feels like they're at home.
And I'm sure not in Dubai.
Fleeing from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the other faces of an artificial paradise.
It's a bill that doesn't speak of and doesn't write.
I'm showing the need of the Asians, contrasting with the basic living conditions of the divine ethnic caste of the Dubain people, the grandchildren of the illiterate Bedouins.
I'm leaving for extreme poverty, for example, for a ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where an army of Asian workers is living under cruel conditions.
That is what they built during one generation in slavery to the desert sky of Manhattan.
They came here with good earnings and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they remained a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it because it could be thrown into the air created by the years of my Dubai.
More and more criticism by the international community makes the topic of cheaper labour extremely difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team has banned discussions in her home about diets after her eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls team admitted that there was a ban on the use of diets in her home after she had been struggling with eating disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Spice's sport for years has not touched and "absorbedly practiced" as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the pop group around the world, which later caused depression and malnutrition.
She now reveals that her experiences have an impact on how she rears her daughter, so she “does not allow her home to talk about diets”.
"Scarlet is 10 years old now and I begin to see that he is more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
"I think that one of the positives about eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak about it.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with the magazine Women's Health Mel, who gained fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the emergence of the social media involved in the press, “aggravating” comments on it caused complexities.
"I began to look at myself improperly, giving up certain groups of foods, practicing increasingly obsessive until I began to feel weak," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that shook the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist have passed a certificate of the cruelty of war to the world.
Legendal picture of Julien Bryan can be seen at the World War II Museum in Gdansk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking about Warsaw's mutilated city.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", started his radio presentation documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship took a long way to the West.
President of Warsaw Stefan Starrzyński first helped him, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave for his own safety immediately.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to the family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe and... remained.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be anywhere where the werewolves were.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan used to live in pictures of death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the city's ruins.
Right before the capitulation, he and the embassies took a negative view of the ocean.
He didn't set out to talk about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What has happened to Warsaw, Paris, London, and even New York."
His alarming chronicles saw President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
“Dad showed the truth and fought German propaganda in this way.
They made films glorifying their wealth.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Case before the jury against the former sportsman accused of numerous violence
Before the jury, there is a process of violence against the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, which is accused of numerous sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of witnessing and hearing arguments, the jury members joined the 23-year-old Clay Conaway lottery.
A woman who was 21 years old says Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two dating on the Bumble page and sending a woman through the man of the picture at which he was naked.
The woman is one of the six Conaway indictees for sexual assault in the years 2013-2018.
According to the prosecutor, the woman’s plea for consent turned into violence, which she faced.
Defenders refer to the opposite relationships of the woman and the gaps in the memory and claim that the woman probably complained that she had come close.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million gold
The gold-covered gold bike worth millions of gold could be seen on the jubilee, the 10th edition of the International Bike Fairs Biike-EXPO.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowić just got him an Oscar bike at the World's Custom Wheels Exhibition in Las Vegas.
A daily copy made a furor at the fairs.
It's an unusual cloth made by my colleague from Zor.
“It’s a seat, it’s a pedal, it’s a driver, you could normally ride it.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
‘The bike body was printed on a 3D printer.
It's the sixth type of virus.
I came up with the idea of this model eating on my first bicycle home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the drawer.
Sketch waited five years for the realization.
Sam's bike has been built for three years," adds Adam Zdanowić.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the path.
Inside are batteries, wires, building elements.
It is hidden under a bodywork that is embedded in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's an engine hidden there too.
The bike guide was set up a week before my trip to the United States at the World Rover Show.
At last I couldn't decide what kind of driver that was.
She's a transporter.
Rover weighs 90 kilograms," he sums it up.
The gold-covered bike was rated in Las Vegas's most important competition category "Best incredibly unique custom copy".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Curriculum Quay port, the Luna Park amusement park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge make a significant contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, which is pumped annually into the Australian economy by visitors to Sydney.
But under the bridge, the ugly truth is hidden.
The famous Sydney River is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution is equivalent to about 15 Olympic pools each year.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our most filthy waters.
According to the new film material entitled "Sydney Bay - up and down", the waters around Australia's most popular city are full of flaws, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rain showers.
However, the largest part of the composition that inspires our navigational channels is plastic.
"I'd call it paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, on September 27th, and this film's publication is being targeted at World Tourism Day.
This aquarium looks beautiful, but it's one of the most changed and contaminated to enter the river along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic passes into our waterways, and most of it affects the bay through storm channel.
"After such powerful falls, the bay... looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollutants come from rain showers.
However, as in the case of the iceberg, the problem with the Sydney Bay is much more serious below the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic remaining to the ocean hits the bottom of the sea.
"As long as there is no time under the water, I think you can't really realize what's in the deep," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water on their own.
I think if more people knew what was under the water, they'd be just scared.
It's oppressive... more than half of what we find on the bottom are plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all the other wastes we're making just below the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, found that there are ways in which people, both local and tourist, can help reduce the amount of plastic and residues that go to our waterways.
"This must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better conduct the recycling of materials and have a greater awareness of what we pour into the liquids that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're starving because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
He absorbs 30% of the carbon dioxide and our source of food.
However, we can arrange this bay and restore it to its former glory, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of containers on beverages that often hit the environment is being carried out in the course of a study on the interdependence between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey conducted among 546 children aged 12 to 18 has found that 82% of respondents feel helpless to plastic waste, and 25% of adults are guilty of problems with disposable plastic packaging.
The study found that plastic waste was also the fourth of the parental concerns, and 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said they were growing concerns about the number of plastic wastes transferred to the oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Mems after the netting match in the semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy game.
On their side, the Slovenians had a nutritious audience that effectively deconcentrated Polish netizens.
Many disputes have also been raised by judges who, in one of the actions, did not intend to take four steps on the part of the economy.
This happened at the key moment of the first set, when this subsidiary Vitala Heynen had the chance to jump off the rivals and win the first party.
But it didn't happen, and the Poles finally had to recognize the height of the race, which after winning 3:1 they played in the final tournament.
Ghana: Dealers from Kaneshie Support the Psychiatric Hospital in Akre
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated food worth 30,000 GH yesterday? to the Psychiatric Hospital in Accra during the short ceremony that took place in Accra.
It is an element of trade in the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
Various foods, fruits, non-alcoholic beverages, teas, clothes, dishes, paradise bananas, manioc and water works were included.
During the visit, the group also talked to several patients at the site.
The event was attended by members of the Management Board of Accra Markets Limited, the Directors of the Association and the Royal Mothers.

She noted that support for hospital care was necessary to show them love and allow them to feel part of society.
Ms. Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow up on this gesture.
Taking gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the director of the hospital, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of patients.
She appealed to other hospital support organisations.
Google is creating a cloud in Poland.
Partner PKO BP
The operator of the State Cloud, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central and Eastern European region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global public cloud computing installation in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project to create the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the participants of the company.
The National Cloud Partnership and Google is another important step on the road that we took in the fall of the year ago, announcing the call of the National Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – digitisation and growth of the Polish economy.
"Now Polish companies are gaining additional, refined tools for its implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of advancing to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly reinforces our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagiełlo, President of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"The investment in the State Cloud Operator is ideally incorporated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions to entrepreneurs based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists," adds PFR President Pavel Borys.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The integration of Google Cloud services into the offer of the State Cloud will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies as their global competitions.
However, thanks to us, we will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, President of the State Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as Internet things (IoT), which often increase the need for the computational power needed to process huge data collections.
VI General Polish Senior Parade
On the afternoon of 24 August 2019, at Ronde de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Seniors' Parade "Dijrzali Spankali" and Piknik Pocolen, the events organized by the Start Foundation began.
“ The Council is an event on a global scale, ” said the Foundation’s Wiśniewski Industry.
The sixth time has passed through the centre of Warsaw to identify how large and diverse communities are seniors.
Through the Paradise, we are countering harmful stereotypes affecting older people and calling for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special floor bus serving the musical mobile scene on which the famous Warsaw DJ Wiki has traditionally appeared.
The participants in the happy choir, at the second known Warsaw and world crossings, passed the Jerusalem Alleys, Kručka Street to the Warsaw Insurgent Place, Mazowiečka Street to the Páłsudski Square and the Royal and Krakow Enterprise Street to the Warsaw University of Campus.
During the march, in which several hundred thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, were participating, the colourful delegations were welcomed by the many gathered on the march, the Warsaws and the tourists.
From Legionow in the parade, two organized groups took part in the yellow and blue corporate shirts.
The first representative of the IIIth Century University and the Senior Club+ and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animators.
On the campus of the University, organizers prepared, among other things, gastronomic and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There are medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stylish Seniors' Station of Senior Voice from professionals Hanny Piekarski and designer Agnieszki Wrwał, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
Stoisko also offered the science workshop to move around the scene and look at pictures.
The ceremony was a fashion show for the Style Seniors.
At the Stop Manipulation – Don’t Buy for Presentation, there was the latest issue of letters and materials on the "Stop Manipulation" campaign.
Other stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
Several studies and consultations could be conducted with health and nutrition experts.
Discussion panels were also organized, including: Helena Norowić, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskie-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacicow or Robert Janowski.
There were no vocal and music attractions on the picnic.
A Polish song legend – Krzysztof Krawczyk, took place on the estrada, and this evening an intergenerational dance that led DJ Wika.
The Tasmanian Devils can provide guidance on the treatment of cancer
The Tasmanian Devils may have the key to the treatment of cancer – researchers have made breakthrough findings that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered ways to mask certain cancer cells
Researchers have found that the same process applies to the Tasmanian devils and to humans
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatment methods for oncological patients
What do the Tasmanian devil and people have in common?
The cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made breakthrough findings that can help revolutionize the therapy of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of deadly tumors in the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study found a way to mask certain cancer cells in both humans and tobaccos, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise signal a resistance to the attack on the cancer.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and the type of skin cancer called cancer from Merkla cells.
"The crucial importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP Chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be used to re-integrate markers, proteins called MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
"It is potentially far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her a lot better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will be used to treat the gums of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells likewise avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in human beings and in the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult it has been to treat the Tusman Devil’s tumors so far.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a chance that this will help control the disease."
Scientists are amazed at the fact that around a really small star a very large planet surrounds
Scientists marvel at the discovery of a solar system 30 years of light from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of the creation of the planets, as a large planet similar to the Jupiter orbits around a small star called the red carnivorous.
Artistic illustration of a gas planet with a giant GJ 3512b orbiting the central star with a red carnivore, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets surrounding them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case stars and planets vary slightly by size.
The star size called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jovis, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, who was in charge of research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low mass are usually the mother stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of a giant gas type similar to Jovisa surrounding a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star by a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red worms are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, since it is only about 35% larger than Jovis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is about 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they're red," Morales said.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet could be thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jovis," Morales said.
The planets come from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that produces the star around which the planets are orbiting.
According to the leading model of creation of the planet called accretion model, the object is originally created from solid particles in the disk, and the gravitational force of the planet at an early stage of development allows for the creation of an atmosphere of surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star can be a little more massive than we expect and can be cold," Morales said.
This leads to a disc's stability disorder, so some denser areas may appear.
These masses can grow until the time of the fall and creation of the planet.
Mildness worker accused of administering a Fascal diphthetary containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County stopped Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a pheasant dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez from Albania was accused of supplying methamphetamine and of causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of a second degree.
The complaint was filed on the basis of a 9 September event at the Thriftway Food Store in Jefferson.
In a statement made by the OregonLive.com portal indicating the likelihood of guilt, the 27-year-old colleague told the deputy County Sheriff Marion that she saw Medina-Hernandez doing a Fascal dip during lunch break, which she then attended.
On the basis of the statement, it is reported that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she reported to the investigator, had never taken methamphetamine, said that “she thought that one of the pieces eaten by her tasted strangely, but did not arouse any suspicions about it”.
When she got back to work, she felt that she had stomach problems and that she couldn't get up on her feet.
According to the newspaper Albany Democratic-Herald, she managed to go to a local hospital where it was found that a Fascal dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of reports from The Smoking Gun, another employee in the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez "was telling her that she added drugs to her food", while another admitted that the suspect had sent her message, claiming that methamphetamine had hit a Fasolium dip by accident.
The OregonLive site informs about the recording from the monitoring of delicates, which is said to show how the back to the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the bistonosis, stands behind the microwave and bows down.
Then she gets up, she wipes her nose, she comes to the table and she puts a beans dip in a small paper pot.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of the biustonosis was probably also on the plate.
The Oregon newspaper Stateman-Journal reports that the sheriff's office staff are saying that there is no doubt at present that customers will be given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison – the security is $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the supply of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illicit weapons.
Johnson gives interest in the distraction-related mix
The journey of Boris Johnson to the General Assembly of the United Nations was unfairly interrupted by the historic decision of the Supreme Court.
However, his second appearance in the Gmin Chamber was neither ashamed nor ashamed of his conscience.
To explain the meaning of this shift, Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster, is in the eye of the cyclone.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": Casting the role of Jamie New on the West End
Another big West Endu star is waiting for the discovery, although she doesn't know about it yet.
The music producers "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" are looking for another Jamie New and are organizing open interviews
The current Layton Williams star is on its way to the United Kingdom music tournament, so producers instead are looking for "an extremely talented, undiscovered young performer".
Interviews in London will take place on October 10th in Apollo Theatre, and candidates who hope to win should prepare 16 plays opening "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CVs and portraits.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and there will be people invited to the presentation next week before the producers.
The producer Nice Burns said: “We are pleased to find that our fantastic musical audience will be playing for another, third year in Apollo.”
We found some fantastic young performers joining Layton Williams and Shane Richie during the tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this music, we open up opportunities for unknown talents that will join the current young professionals.
Williams, who took part in Jamie New's role in February and replaced John McCree's role as the first to play, urged on Twitter "SME Boys to send their tapes":
The tour of this music will begin in February and the performances in West End were extended until 29 August 2020.
Musical presents 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the prom for school in dress.
He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure he'll be a star.
Thanks to the help of the mother and the local legend of the Drag Loco Chanelle community, it begins discovering its identity, opposing prejudices and a career in the light of the bottle.
The music in this presentation was inspired by BBC documentary film entitled "James. Drag Queen at 16", written by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and words of songs by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval obtains an order in the natural gas sector worth SEK 110 million
Alfa Laval – the world leader in the field of heating, central separation and liquid transport – has been ordered to deliver air coolers to the gas processing plant in the United States. The order is worth about 110 million Swedish crowns and has been registered in the Spatial heat exchangers in the EnergyPion, and supplies are planned for 2020.

Marian Banas.
What's the case with Chief NIK?
Renting property at below the market price is a reservation that appears in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Marian Banasi.
What the treasurer is doing in this matter we've asked in the Treasure Administration Chamber in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report for "Supervisor" TVN, expressed doubts about the property statements of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Marian Banasis.
For a few months, the study has been the Central Anti-Corruption Office.
Control is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,000 gold each year.
The report "Supervisor" revealed that the hotel was located in a stone rented by him for hours.
Chief NIK later explained on state television why he only took over 5,000 gold a month to rent the property.
The "Elector's" magazine, referring to experts from the valuation of real estate, estimated that it should be 15 thousand gold a month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower because of the simple reason: I entered into a preliminary contract and it was precisely that the tenant was going to buy this stone, which led me to agree to a lower rent that the remaining items would be counted when selling the stone," Banas said.
However, there was doubt as to whether such a procedure would constitute a breach of the law.
Konrad Zawada, a press spokesman for the Treasure Administration Chamber in Krakow, informed TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"All such questions, please address the Minister of Finance," he added.
The Authority explained that in such cases ‘the State Treasury is acting’.
The press spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of issues that may arouse some reservations.
“The Treasury Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information, as well as it is based in a certain way on this information that is publicly available.
On this basis, he is deciding whether or not to carry out any specific proceedings," MF spokesperson explained.
"On the other hand, because we are all in possession of a treasure secret in the entire financial resort, we never speak, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," he stressed, asked about the Marian Banasis case.
Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the treasure offices do not communicate to the public information of this type of message".
"It is known that the whole treasure machine deals with very similar cases throughout the country," he said.
Secrets of the royal family: amazing visitors often flew by the royal plane
Within the framework of their service duties, members of the royal family have to make hundreds of trips throughout the world.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world for important events and events.
It's no surprise that having your own plane is linked to privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand on long lines for departure, they do not apply their limits on the number of luggage, and they can, as it turns out, invite any guests – including really uninvited ones.
According to a recent premiere on Channel 5 of the documentary film not only the queen and Prince Philip often travels by royal aircraft.
During the program entitled "Royal Flight Secrets", the Royal Flight Navigator revealed that guests often flew together with the royal family.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It is not surprising that the queen could have wished her beloved lovers to accompany her on her journey, for she is known for her deep attachment to the dogs of the corporal race.
Since her younger years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four - horned creatures and has heard that since her coronation she has owned more than 30 corps.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corps: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
There were five cockers sleeping with them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as the four dogs that are cross-breeding the shield from the corga: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal aircraft crew was sure to have full hands.
A staff member of the royal house carrying out dogs and asking them to meet their needs before taking them on board a plane," says Shields.
I'm glad to say that there's never been an incident.
The programme has also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the Queen carries with her during her journey in the performance of her duties.
“ In 1953, ” said the film’s Narrator, “the queen took a 12 - ton luggage on her journey of 70,000 kilometres. ”
To be able to see it better, it's less than the same as the two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only one who is weak in fashion.
Likewise, Princess Cambridge also has her own favourites for the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dresses has a private seat.
The new law enters into force.
Damaged people get their rents
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that the rent will continue to be paid in cases of serious injury – the Financial Manual informs.
This is the Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of persons injured in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee fixed on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, they were definitely lower than they are currently guaranteeing, and in some cases the insurers have already stopped paying the rent.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has been in the process of creating a mechanism for many years to ensure that financial support from the communication OC insurance or the farmer's OC is guaranteed in cases of serious damage," says Aleksander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the Financial Accountant's office.
This was considered necessary by the Financial Ombudsman because it is often very tragic situations concerning people in very poor health who, for example, cannot work due to an accident, and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer provided compensatory rent and for increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sum in the OC policies.
Part of it was threatened in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the limits on the liability of the insurer were significantly lower than the current one.
This is why the problem of exhausting the guarantee in previous years was most often affecting people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions led to an increase in prices.
"We also noted that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount amounted to EUR 350 000 for each injured case.
Currently it is EUR 5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of injured persons.
So this is a huge difference compared to earlier periods, from which the problem required the legislator's intervention," recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
In view of the fact that the amount of the guarantee is raised for a period of time, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Fund would be the amount of the guarantee in force at the time of the transfer to the Rent Claim Fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a court ruling fixing the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC insurance contract.
This shall take place in the event of an increase in the amount of the guarantee on the judicial basis under Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing binding relationship.
“In recent days, we have sent letters to people who in the past have come to us with an application for intervention.
We inform them of the new powers and of course we will provide further support if any problems arise," says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting a boy's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend had shown a familiar sextatism that arose in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old who is an architect from education explained to the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her with something "trophie", which can be praised in front of friends.
“He violated my privacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The resident of Cordoba herself decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F., to bed and told him she had a special surprise.
With the help of an accumulator, she put her eyes on him, and then she caught the trigger and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled down, and I caught up on the cell phone to get ready," he said.
“I wanted to go out, but she started hurting me.
She caught me for a shirt and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing sextatism, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said to the jury.
Eventually, she was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former congressman of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired state congressman named Alabama died on behalf of the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
Family spokesman said that Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting the cancer of the pancreas.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from the state of Alabama in the Deep South thanks to the party's winning supporters here.
He served ten terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards answered that he would like to return to courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where they will return to a common debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country," said Edwards, according to the family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his position as well as the country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that for his honour, the flag on the Alabama State Chapter will be released for half the mast.
"He was the person of a real state official and was the best husband of the state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most remarkable policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspired" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed great appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a careful leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better".
The Prince and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a youth meeting at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Town, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a careful leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether it's meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation @ObamaFoundation or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, it's inspiration for many people," added Obama, placing a picture representing the smiling Meghan singing with the Foundation's leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of the British Vogue, hosted by the former actor in the series "Suites".
In a sincere conversation, the first lady spoke about motherhood and how it changed.
"To be a mother means to lead to the mastering of the art of forgiveness," Obama said in a story.
"Maternity has taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I want to be in their age, but who they are in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure to be on the church is, shared with the priestly council during an interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – thrown by yourself and others – can sometimes push you," she said.
"My advice is therefore to relax and not to rush into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were good at school and making new acquaintances before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trump retains a permit for the sale of alcohol despite the claim for the owner's fitness
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Alcohol Control Commission in Washington has removed the request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose the licence for the sale of alcohol due to the owner’s fitness.
The Agency has ruled on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbinians is unfounded because most of them do not live in the district or have no real estate in it.
"The Washington Post" says that for the second time, these reasons are trying to withdraw the alcohol sales permit from the hotel, calling for a provision in force in the district saying that the alcoholics who apply for the alcohol sales permit must prove to be "good".
In the original complaint lodged last summer, President Donald Trump was alleged to be breaking the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
"The Sun": Intermediate report recognizes the police service scandal in Cleveland as the worst in Britain
The inspectors recognized the police as the worst police in Britain.
In the mushy report, police work in Cleveland was considered inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of the Police of Her Royal Town states that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in the Police Department in Cleveland.
New calls were made to resolve police services, with five commanders taking the lead in six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Inspectorate of the Police of Her Royal Town said: "Our last inspection has resulted in a significant deterioration of standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after not less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious", but unscrupulous, allegations of his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts has been suspended after the arrest under charge of serious misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood presented the commission with the commission for the recruitment of employees for sexual activity.
He's out of service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Tours said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for him to intervene now in the Home Office department."
Police commander Richard Lewis said: “After the improvements, I will take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through changes.”
We're visualizing the skatepark!
Do young people finally wait?
Older residents are hampering young people's passions for the ride on the street and the discorooms, while they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Olav.
Young people have been reminded of the place to ride on rollers, discorails, hooligans, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our fractures.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time, there's been a loud noise about the lack of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back and asking the office what's next?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was disturbed by a young man riding in the center.
"I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the block at Pl. Piłsudski in order to be interested in the situation of the young man in Malawi," he writes to Malgorzata.
"The block's residents have called the City Guard several times in vain.
To prove such daily situations in connection with the transmission of photos."
We asked others about this.
Most clearly say that young people simply don't have a place to drive in the city and for years they've really wanted places for themselves.
Under Facebook's post, a lion's-eye comment appeared.
We already wrote in July that there is a chance that the Skatepark will be built in the city of Olava.
The mayor reported that the city had been funded for the construction of the Skatepark.
"The project consulted with young people together with the permits is ready.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the financing of the project under the Polish Sports Programme “Budawa Skatepark in Oławy”, we were told in the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 zł.
Amount of funding applied for: 263 440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what's the point.
"We do not yet have any information on the relationship between the decisions made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism of the application for funding," informs Elžbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European Funding Department UM Oława.
"The information received from the Ministry's staff shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sport Programme should take place in October".
We also asked for a visualization of the Olav Skatepark.
We'll introduce her below.
The youth informed the editor that on Saturday (September 28th) they would collect signatures under a petition concerning the construction of the Skatepark in Olav.
"The rebel youth has seen the last post on Facebook and has come to the conclusion that they are organizing a collection," Mikolaj writes.
Signatures under request will be collected from 12 a.m. in the area of Lidl.
Polish Cup 2019/20: 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the most interesting competitions in the extraclass.
The biggest legend has been the memory game since 1996/1997.
On June 18, 1997, the Legia took over an old stadium on the last row.
Both teams shared a point.
The masters had to win, the second in the order of the Polish championship gave the point.
By the 87th minute, the Legia was running 2:0, but for five more minutes the earthquake hit – the Vidzev shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club over the years has fallen into increasing tarapats until it has ceased to count in the struggle for the championship and has fallen from the highest playing class.
The last two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The League – on its way to the title – had two victories – 5:1 and 1:0 on its way out.
Back to Elite
At present, ships are fighting to return to national elite.
These plans were delayed at least a year, as in the previous games, being one of the favorites, they were unable to advance to the comfort of the extraclases.
As a result of this failure in the summer club, a team revolution occurred.
The authorities have changed, finally placed on Coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking another step up the club hierarchy they have helped in the league battles Marcin Robak and Mateusz Možženjen.
For the time being, Vidzev is fourth in Table II of the League, but in Pucharza Polski he won on Tuesday an extraklass Słęsk Wrocław 2:0.
The legia, in the same sizes, was at the exit of the Unbreakable Desert.
Extraordinary Start
The only pair made up of the top-class representatives in 1/16 finals is her nickname ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place on October 29-31.
This year, 1/8 finals (3-5 December) were scheduled to be played.
The final will be held on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebelliously" and the investigation into impeachment must turn to his own tortoise
We never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are taking part in an attempt to hide the facts of an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation in this case may take place," said Pelosi in a report to the CNN at the Chapter Mountain.
"They do the work they started by keeping the facts and the time needed to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump has asked the President of Ukraine of the Land Hall to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as shown in the protocol.
Trump denied that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice notified a complaint by the complainant concerning the procedure of Trump with Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint from the intelligence community officials, the Department of Justice found that Trump’s telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelos said that on Friday, the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as a witness.
She added, however, that in her opinion, Barr "rebellied himself".
It's been a long time.
"For (Barra) is listed in all this," added Pelosi, referring to the mention of Trump about his Attorney General during July's conversation with the head of Ukraine.
It is interesting that he has made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi reported that he was "very afraid" of informants who Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that in the past the spies were being treated differently.
I think the President's words go beyond responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalers are playing an important role in discovering – sending out irregularities in our government," said Pelosi, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information signalers seriously undermine the government's integrity".
On Tuesday, Pelosi carried out a historic step in the announcement of a formal investigation into the conduct of an act that was not in conformity with the law on the basis of allegations of attempting to pressure the leader of a foreign country to gain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the statement published on Thursday of the complaint, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "feel Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signaler also commissioned the White House lawyers to remove the computer system conversation from which they are stored for the benefit of the officials of the Council of Ministers and to place it in a system designed for particularly sensitive information.

Possible ban driving too fast for the attacker Crystal Palace Christian Benteke
The Star Primer League Christian Benteke, which has been caught twice in the last two months at speed, is threatening the ban on driving.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to driving by Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit to 50 miles per hour on the A3 in Richmond in south-west London on January 20.
Then, in March, photoradars in Putney in south-west London registered Belgium at a speed of 89 miles per hour, which is a two-fold limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentece from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to stand at the Court of the Room at Lavender Hill this morning.
He admitted two irregularities at the beginning of July in the context of a simplified procedure whereby the offences are more likely to be prosecuted at a meeting held by one Judge of the Chamber.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and representative of the Second Hasacas Club, expressed doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he is not satisfied with his participation.
In his interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral persons from outside who do not show links with any of the members and who have not previously shown an interest.
For example, Davies hired the NC as a lawyer who wrote 10 per cent to the Quak Palmer axis for payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to hold a position in the Verification Committee because he is interested in this," he said.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympics, was present before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his association with the club, while suggesting that if he was in the presence of Palmer, he would be the subject of bias and bias.
As expected, the Commission members were expected to start work from yesterday, following the ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to end on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and her members are the Consultant for the Corporate Government and Ms Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokovie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the Government of Unity
Two major parts of Israel, the Alliance of White and White, continued on Friday negotiations on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mission of forming the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks discussed the possibility of a rotating chairmanship of the two parties in the government and the rest of Netanyahu as prime minister, but, as the Israeli daily Haarec writes, there was no convergence of views.
Talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the Blue-White informed in the communication that it had presented the preliminary submissions.
He accuses Likud of "defying in his position", demanding that his leader and former Prime Minister Netanyahu remain in charge of the government, and in the office's office, which is previously part of his ultra-orthodox policy.
"From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-White would not agree to these conditions," the communication was published by them.
Because, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, the Lukud wants to "bring Israel to the second round of elections".
Leader Benny Gantz refused to support the government he would lead Netanyahu as they charged him with engaging in three corruption cases, on which the prosecutor could formally accuse him of having been appointed on Wednesday.
"If the White and White people had obtained a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, it would force them to negotiate which neither party wanted," EFE writes.
President Reuwen Riwlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed calling for a "rotational government", suggesting that the prime minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if charges against Netanyahu were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who believe that the case was caught in a blind alley.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of a survey published on Friday's public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by calling the government of a rotational leadership unit for Netanyahu and Gantza.
50.6 per cent of the Israelis are talking about such a solution, and 32.1 per cent of the respondents are opposed to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in Israeli society – the question of who should first be in charge of the cabinet, 41.8% of the respondents refer to Netanyahu and 40% to Gantz.
In another survey published by the newspaper 'Israel Hajam', the percentage of members of the government of the unit increases to 63%, 60% are opposed to the new elections that would be the third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, the Gantz Alliance won 33 mandates in the 120-town Kneset, Likud Netanyahu defeated 32 mandates.
Netanyahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 messengers, while Gantz is 54.
None of the side pages have collected 61 mandates required to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check" when Valia faces the final game with Australia in the World Cup, which can shape their lot in the tournament.
The victory of Wallia over the kangaroos would put this team at the position of a certain favorite for the winning Group D and ensure its participation in the likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wallia once and for all 14 during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent brilliantly to start with England in one eight final.
"Let's make it clear that both teams want to try and go through this and be in front of the group," said the whaler Tipuric.
In the past there have been some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they'll try hard to get us this victory, and we want to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it would be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in the third place game when the kangaroos defeated.
And their total record under the lead of coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the southern hemisphere.
Valia represented the course of thirteen lost test matches from Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few saved from this 9-6 victory that will run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric, asked whether the team had experienced a mental setback before the victory, added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect a mental block to happen, I don't know.
At the end of the last match we probably left at the battlefield about 15 points, so the final result looks much smaller than it actually was.
If Valia succeeds, then the battle of Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of mill Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be of fundamental importance during the arrest and downfall.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met with both contestants on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's waiting for him.
"These are the players playing in the position of the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When you play against the world class of third-line contestants, it's always known that there's going to be a hard game to play.
These two are always performing with the best racers in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more aggressive seven and probably feels better because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best racers in the world and face challenges than to deal with a third line of mills, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and when you're fighting these two, you're sure to have to be in the top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday was almost the end of the Cup, but for us, it's an important match in this World Cup.
Imprint is an important element of it.
When we build our strength and put forth constant effort, we will fly like on wings and be hard to defeat.

The book premiere.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite "gentle race" organisation.
They've adopted in their ranks the ones they've been guarding.
Can a crime be more powerful than a national identity?
In your hands, we're giving you another book on war or military.
We are conducting a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries are analysing the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, recalling their activities and observing the recruitment process at different stages of the war.
Did the Danish forces differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't a Polish-composed unit be created?
What does the official historical narrative of cooperation in individual European countries look like today?
What happened to volunteers after the war ended?
Among other questions, the Waffen-SS book is based on solid research material.
We sought to present a more subtle and more balanced image of cooperation in Europe during World War II, also attempting to break the methodological boundaries of history and a given period of time by presenting debates by the research authorities from different countries. (...) If the fates of the main victims of this war - forced labourers, Jews, Greeks, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovenian population - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or supranational terms, so many actors are essentially examined from a national perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic", when the White House struggles to find arguments about impeachmentu
The White House officials are shocked to learn how to resist the renewed pressure on impeachment Thursday, and one of the speakers who is familiar with the situation describes the "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
It seems that this reinforces "an anxiety, uncertainty and anxiety" – one of the people associated with the White House describes the mood in the Western wing – that the informant's accusations can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
This person said: "There is no doubt that nothing is hidden there."
The White House officials were still unsure of how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in this situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of avoiding the controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "It does not seem like something that will skip along with the next cycle of news headlines" – the person joked.
Another person who knows the course of the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as "a state of shock", accompanied by growing distrust that, along with the ongoing investigation into impeachment, the President would be more likely to respond in a irresponsible way and become "hard to control".
This concern is shared by another speaker, who claims that the President-in-Office expects him to show more "responsive" behaviour, and the pressure placed on him will certainly increase with every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concerns that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and unanticipated explosions – this is in the context of the election year both from the Presidency's point of view and elections.
Faced with the biggest threat in the presidency so far, Trump circled from attack to defense, again reaching a strategy that he considered effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to embellish his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in conducting an investigation into his political rivals in order to divert attention and focus on the activities of democrats and democratic candidates of Joe Biden and to discredit the informant as a leader of party initiatives.
But while many people in the White House are engaged in a fight after Mueller's investigation, something has changed this time – counsellors and consultants said.
The President, whose sign of recognition is force, the Middle Press Conference has shown as a defeated – one of the people familiar with the situation has declared.
While Trump eagerly accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that harm can be avoided, and some of them hold that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zelenski, which they consider to be unreliable.
And as it often happens when the president is the object of the attacks, the fact is that he is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies associated with the White House indicates that the results of the president's support poll are skyrocketing, and impeachment will not be too much in achieving new sympathy.
"There is no positive need to concentrate on the President's impeachment in the next four months," especially if he is in difficulty with his legislative programme and prevails in the new message headlines.
Another speaker said that those who held that impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Concerned White House officials sought help from advisers by completing a response team to impeachment.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, taking into account that these efforts are at an early stage, it remains unclear whether any initiative in the style of the management centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that it was the belief that a coordinated legislative and communication strategy was required with a determined leader capable of carrying out an attack on the PR in response to the publication of a timely report by the signaler and with a view to preventing the disengagement of democratic actions concerning the impeachment of the report.
The speaker on the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was evident when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later it could be felt that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the pressure will now be greater than during Robert Mueller's investigation, which mostly kept silence, and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in the preparation of the impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work of Trump and a former head of the electoral staff – a person related to the case said.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it's not a true suggestion that he will lead this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his programme," he said, "but I have not participated in any talks with the president or his team to join the team in order to support the false impeachment narrative."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in impeachment.
"We are responding to matters properly" – Sekulow answered when asked by NBC News for a comment.
Today the White House feels the absence of an experienced lawyer in the impeachment area, after Emmet Flood, who worked at the Clinton impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the present adviser, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The spokesperson for the White House's strategy stated that at no time did the officials generally plan to engage people or create a headquarters, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person who could lead a political struggle.
Traveller Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean went to repair for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will set off this year on a trip, presenting a completely new look.
After the restoration, which has absorbed an impressive $110 million (89 million), the ship attracts a wide selection of culinary flavors from around the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This summer, the Explorer will stay at the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on the land ends, the crew promises unforgettable impressions on the sea.
Having a satisfactory offer for everyone, Explorer, after renovation of $110 million, i.e. about $89 million, moved into a passenger ship that provides perfect entertainment for the whole family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family film using weather spells in a plenary film.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that allow passengers to admire the views of the ocean without having to go on board.
The lovers of water will be attracted to a new deck designed by a pool combining the style of the Caribbean resort with the clocks of the water park.
The pool surrounds the beach hammocks and beds ideal for sunrises, and the two modernized are in the hands of people who want strong impressions on board.
The attractive tourist for passengers of all ages imposes the number of activities to be made available to guests during the trip to destination.
Designed for children's little Adventure Ocean is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend free time for teenagers offers super games and a music area prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this is not enough, the whole family can be measured in the "Studio B" on the ship in a laser tag playing with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also be used as an ice-cream for skiing.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to experience exotic tastes from around the world, as they go to the pampering of the restaurants on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on board the Izumi restaurant, and in the newly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen there is an excellent meal inspired by an innovative look at the traditional Italian cuisine.
Other gastronomic points on board include an American restaurant offering Chops Grille steaks, a Latin bar Boleros, a Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets express bar.
Travel, with an option of seven or nine-day route, flows from Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it will join Allure of the Seas, which has recently undergone an incredible repair.
After the 58-day Allure metamorphosis, in a sum of $165 million, the tour operator offered guests who had previously made reservations, a voucher worth $300 to be issued on board.
The tour operator said: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship, which will undergo transformation as part of the modernisation of the Royal Amplified fleet.”
The programme, which requires more than $1 billion of investment, comprising 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unrepeatable attractions and to experience gastronomic after-night life.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "slow photos of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of the state of California obviously cannot stand the bare truth that President Donald Trump is being investigated.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives' Hearing Commission, made the above-mentioned commitment during the preliminary statement during the hearing on the complainant's complaint, as if Trump had turned to Ukraine for assistance in the initiation of an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotesque representation" of the left and their "medial axis" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the nest.
"Democratics in this commission were negotiating with people who they thought were Ukrainians to get naked photos of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the President in a position of accusation when they will have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up giving the compliments, the political reporter on the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to check if the Democrats were really trying to... find out.
So far, only the Connecticut representative, Jim Hims, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is true, which confirms the thoughts of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com Portal suspects that Nunesa's comments on the nude referred to "certain more favourable and unconfirmed information", which are likely to appear in Steele's controversial acts,
It is celebrated, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of a tape that shows him at night watching the urine of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential biofuel research can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one question seems to be turning off renewable energy – aircraft.
However, Professor Albert University has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as a fuel for aviation.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Albert for agriculture, life science and the environment, who started work on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuels derived from fatty wastes such as fat from restaurants, fat from animal origin, and scrap oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can be used in the production of low-quality oils, thus making it highly 85% lower in carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as using waste from other industries in the process.
This technology is intended to imitate hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as in diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility of biofuel use, the previously developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which in the case of high-level aircraft was a serious threat.
"The problem with aviation fuel is a bit of a wrong wheel," said Bressler.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional hydrocarbon biofuel processing and hydrogen addition.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on the other option.
This option is more risky.
The printing company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialization of the product because the airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, are increasing investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times when the situation may be reversed and carbon tax imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin for investment to support a cost of $25 million in the construction of a production plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the proposed carbon reduction will amount to about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further carbon reduction.
“As a technology specialist,” said Bressler –
I have the task of developing options that allow for informed decisions and many choices."
FIGHT: Another fraud against the granddaughter
8 thousand zł and 750 euros lost Zamenza's apartment, thinking that it was helping his grandson who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a cheating maid.
“He called the woman in the middle of the day a man who married her for her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
The senior wanted to help the grandson, she passed 8,000 zł and 750 euros to the fake police officer who came to her house," relates Asp. Dorota Krukowski-Bubilo from the foreign police.
The police are looking for the perpetrators, and once again they appeal for caution:
"Each phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we receive a phone call requesting financial support, which will arouse our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling alert number 112.
We also appeal to younger members of the family.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's let them know how fraud works.
Please be careful and do not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that if Britain's Brexit is withdrawn, they're threatening the US as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the prime ministers of the cabinet said last night that the country was threatened with a "violent social breakdown" if the original result was questioned by the result of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's allies from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened with social unrest on the scale of the protests of "yellow chameleons" in France due to social inequality and confusion in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "satisfaction of the moods" during a heated debate on the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "surrender".
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "There have never been protests in this country such as the demonstrations "gilets junes" ("yellow chameleons") or residences in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young gilets – using encrypted phones, which can coordinate pickets, and to push people into protest, there are just a few unwelcome populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles exploded after a lion of sworn oaths had destroyed four white policemen who killed a black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow flashy shirts – Gilet junes – have been deserting and destroying the streets of Paris since more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to the warning by Johnson in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to leave the EU, there will be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them vote after the United Kingdom remains in the European Union, ten million citizens will be unhappy," said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their letter and who will not forgive.
Many do not need to see a few hundred thousand people on the street soon.
One of the prime ministers of the cabinet added that the country was threatened with "violent social breakdown" if the result of the first referendum was questioned by the result of the second.
Johnson called for the organisation of general elections in which voters would decide on the fate of Brexit.
According to the report, the prime minister faces the risk of a cabinet's rebellion that wants to reduce requests for Brexit and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU at this point.
The capital, the Kjubovna and the Krosna were impressed in Krakow.
Behind us Talk'N"Roll
Over 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) 11 inspiring performances of the speakers, including Shimon Holovna, Krystyna Czubówna or Ireneusz Krosna.
It's all at the Talk'N'Roll conference, which has been held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Extending the horizons, talking about the voice of voices and joint discussions, which can be an incentive for further development.
This was achieved by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, and among them among other people known from the media - Szymona Hołowna, Christina Chubowna and Irene Krosno.
The password of this year's Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future focused on the presence of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the managing director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told us how the brand that is being built around him might have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if the future is to be created, while Chris Badura took the issue of empathy at the time of brilliant technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that can help in managing careers and increasing overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a wide-ranging discussion with Christina Chubowna, who, among other things, talked about how her career in Poland had changed over the years.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country has admitted that, thanks to development technology, everyone today can struggle with this profession.
However, he does not believe that, in the near future, a person in the position of a lecturer is completely replaced by technology.
After it, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of life in times of overloading information, emotional or overloading in the matter of choice, giving the public valuable guidance on how to deal with it, and Luke Lötocha, in his speech, talked about what could lead to another industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0".
Learning, Learning, Learning
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedinak to the scene.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosna, who first played the public at the pantonum, and then, for example, in his own career, told about how he tried to maintain the right balance between the career on stage and private life.
In his speech, he also took the role of Szymon Hołovni, stressing above all the importance of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation dimensionally and must be ready to use this time.
In addition, the capital shared his thoughts about the reality around us, calling for anecdotes that could cause smiles on the faces of the sights.
Then Adrian Crewuszka appeared on the scene, who reviewed the history and goals of several innovation models and referred them to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Słowiak, for example, Rubika's bone, he spoke of an approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers has certainly introduced something new in view of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to see the performances, and the food reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to a great public engagement.
The organizers provided a transmission for all those who could not personally participate in the event, and the lectures are available on the website.
Governments of law instead of governments of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the triading of power," writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, published on Thursday.
The report 'The rule of law rather than the rule of law' documents, inter alia, changes in the size of justice and in the field of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published on Thursday a report entitled “Governments of law instead of governments of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that the largest human rights reform in Poland was recorded in the years 2015-2019 after 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the triading of power.
By adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law governments have been replaced by the law," HFPC experts say.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the field of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, the rights of women, the rights of LGBT and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on this scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the partial interests of the parties.
This has shifted to the ongoing crisis of the rule of law and to the weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said lawyer Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "the period of systemic change in both the state and "in the field of the protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes have often been adopted at an accelerated pace, without social consultation and despite the concerns of the legal environment, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained lawyer Malgorzat Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "weakening independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), non-compliance with binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and weakening the guarantee of the protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs has recognized as particularly disturbing “the situations in which public authorities have failed to respond or simply ignored cases of aggression”.
The Foundation’s experts have noted that some changes have been made to the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the State's activities in the area of the limitation of the rule of law are a persistent dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"Not only does not implement these recommendations weaken Poland's position as the leader of democratic changes in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but it also affects Poland's responsibility for violating the law of the European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life for honour killing
Women's rights experts argue that the investigation of justice is often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspects for bail and the involvement of cases in public awareness.
"It takes so long for people to forget," says Farzana Bari, the defender of women's rights and the first founder of the Gender Studies Department at the University in Pakistan, and adds that even the widespread murder of Baloch has been resolved for more than three years.
Although data on women's rights are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 found at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings.
Many activists claim that real numbers are much higher, and the network promoting awareness of crimes of honorary motives estimates that there are about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed each year in Pakistan worldwide.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are small, because many immigrants are staying outside Poland on a permanent basis – the "Rzeczpospolita" is the fifth.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that Poland's average earnings in other European countries amounted to more than $8.6 thousand in 2018, which means that almost a thousand gold, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “estimates that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union countries reached a record value of $154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier”, we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk, says that Polish people are increasingly working on the international labour market, where they use different options available.
"There are also more specialists and professionals who are moving from country to country in search of better conditions, like international corporate workers," the newspaper said.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
“This was the most significant in the RFN in 2018, because by 11%, total earnings of Polish immigrants increased (up to around €27 billion).
However, Poland has earned the most on the island – almost 35 billion zł", we read more.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that, despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of migrant workers does not decrease.
Because the Saxons in the West and Northern Europe (in front of Norway) are often a chance for a few times higher earnings than in Poland.
"And even at minimum rates in a given country, for example in Germany, EUR 9,5-11,7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" indicates that the Poles remain not only because of higher earnings, but also because they have become embellished abroad.
Many Poles leave abroad the roots of what they see after smaller transfers of money to the country.
These last year were the lowest of years.
As economist Tadeusz Chrąštsky reminds us, along with the extension of the period of stay abroad, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and decrease their height.
"Emigrants are getting close," we read on Friday "Rzeczpospolitje".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending for almost a month, and undetected rainfall causes death as a result of the drying of buildings and the destruction of many crops.
In northern India, the monsoon usually subsides in early September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for a few more days, it will end at the latest in the decade.
In many areas of the country, the rainfall is still undetectable – recently in western India, the cities of Pune medium and quarter rains have resulted in the death of several hundred people and the launch of the collapse of buildings.
It came to the collapse of the houses, people ran through the streets in the water on their knees, which normally takes place only during the apogeum monsoon.
Heavy rains also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hejdarabad.
As a result of long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many homes have been destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers were preparing for the likely drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not well seen by farmers.
This amount of rain is not something normal at this time of the year.
"Through it my vegetables – and now I have strawberry, beans, nuts and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the late influence, as well as the late end of the monsoon, means a rise in the price of onion, which is an indispensable ingredient of Indian food.
The Cebula, which usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds in British), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 pounds in British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Feasts and holidays are also at risk.
Another big festival is the 8th of October of the festival of Dasara, during which the Hindus raise huge dolls like the comic, representing Ravana, to be made of a bloated snake and a slender smile from the epoch "Ramayana".
Ravan's burning symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, considering that Ravana's image is made of paper, if the monsoon continues, then Ravana will laugh the last.
Implementation of the Energy Synergie Technology Sp. z o.o. sale agreement in restructuring

Doodle celebrates 21th birthday to Google
It would be hard to imagine a world today without Google.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the annoying questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How much?" are one of the favorite categories sought by the Poles.
The giant data shows that last year we were willing to ask, for example, "Where is the storm?", "How to make spaghetti?" and "How many fingers does the horse have?", "How to get rid of the fruit fly?", "How to eat cocoa?".
Today, the search engine cares about today's twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and up to 96% of people in Poland use "Giog's Uncle" – welcome today the special Google Doodle.
He's not animated this time.
Google recalls its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed – as in a photo from the 1990s.
Catalogueing of information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was to catalog all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is the word game.
It comes from the mathematical term Google means the number of ten raised to the power of set.
This name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as many pages as possible from global Internet resources.
The Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependencies between the parties, which worked better than normal segregation methods based on the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine was named BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon they launched a famous website google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" appeared information about the extremely high incidence of Google search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - a brilliant development with every month, a boost to the next markets and an increase in the value of the company.
By June 2000, the Google URL Index has more than a billion positions, making Page and Brina the world's largest Internet search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there any other development fields?
"The mission of Google is to organize global information resources so that they are widely available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this area, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalevski from Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that work in contact with plant protection products at high levels may present a high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This was the case with a group of Americans from Japanese origin in Hawaii who have been investigated for over 30 years.
Scientists have found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical documentation contact with such agents at work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase the risk of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results are based on data from over 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who participated in the cardiological program Kuakini Honolulu.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life of decay, so their effects on health may be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results have been observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez reported: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
It was likely because the factors associated with aging became more important, which masked the potential causal relationship between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of the circulation system in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelänski-Trump phone call: Porozenko is giving her three money
Washington's policy is having a stormy week to initiate the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
Getting used to a political scandal is for a political debutor of the Green Hall, a situation he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first of them?
Nearly at the start of the phone call Trump told Zeland that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than for European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they describe Trump's attack on Chancellor Germany Angela Merkel as the German leaders, along with other leaders of European countries, are engaged in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked a response from Greenland, which announced that it was true of Trump, not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelzeński added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Petro Porozenko, former president of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Porozenko said she was grateful for the EU support granted during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Then Trump mentioned military assistance and asked Zejenski for investigation not in one, but in two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second related to entering the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the Democratic e-mail box during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it will destroy European relations, or whether it will destroy relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us" – he said after publishing a recording of Zelzeński's telephone conversation in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming "Nordic Four" summit, which is scheduled to take place in October.
Former Deputy Chief Inspector legally acquitted
The court has cleared Jerze Wisniewski of the crimes he's been charged with.
After six years Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleared of charges.
The District Court of Industry has cleared Jerz Wisniewski, former Chief of the Military Inspectorate of the Commercial Quality of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, of the charge of overcrowding.
The Lubel prosecutor accused him of betraying the deputy mayor of the time limit of control in the plant producing food oil.
A recent ruling on this issue has been passed.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
"The court has maintained the defendant's judgment of instigation," says Judge Malgorzata Reizer, a spokesperson for the District Court in Industry.
It is a judgment issued by the Regional Court of Industry on 14 February.
Jerzy Wisniewski then commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was presented by the Appeals Office in Lublin for the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Mayor of Podkarpacki on April 30, 2012.
The Court clearly held that I was innocent and that I did not break the existing law.
I was convinced that my phone call at the time was consistent with the law in force with the Marshal of Podkarpacki.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was wrong and caused irrevocable damage to both the food producer's entrepreneur and the loss of my person's image in my employers, among employees and in the local community.
The action brought against me in the Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, false definitions of the legal basis, not confirmed in reality.
With the help of the CBA in Reese, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and deprived of my financial resources.
I've spent a long time keeping my wife."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski served as the voivodship inspector for the commercial quality of agricultural and food products in 2009-2013.
He was removed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin in 2013.
According to the investigators, he had to betray the then Marshal's Voyeur (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to four years of deprivation of liberty) in the plant producing food oil belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Vice-Martial.
This warning, as prosecutors from Lublin claimed, should have caused the company's owner to know about the controls and to correct labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard allegations of overcrowding, which threatened him until he was three years old.
“I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the legal sentence that has been depriving me of my accusations," Jerzy Wisniewski comments.
The White House tried to hide the conversation with Zelenski
On Thursday, an editorialist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Zejenski, was seeking foreign interference in the US elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, which is probably an intelligence officer, he wrote: “As part of my official duties, I have been informed by many members of the US government that the President has used his office to demand the involvement of a foreign country in the 2020 elections in the United States”.
“The drum used the part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to realize its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to press on the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the reelection in 2020," says the report quoted by The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader is "given to understand" that contacts with Trump depend on whether he will "show the will to take the game" in matters that President Rudy Giuliani's lawyer should have informed him more precisely.
The author acknowledges that he was not a witness to the conversation, but points out that he was informed in detail about its contents by “many White House officials who had direct information on the subject”, and their relations covered.
"The following days after this conversation, I learned from many American officials that high-ranking representatives of the White House intervened to "closure" all archived records of this conversation, and in particular the verbal record that has been prepared, as is usually done, in the crisis room of the White House," we read more.
"The High Level White House officials told me that the White House lawyers "commanded them" to remove electronic records from the computer system in which such records are stored.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate confidential information," wrote the author of the report.
"In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," said the signaler.
As the AP comments, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on the President's possible impeachment and also contains valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the conversation with the Green White House, after pressuring the Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relations of the people who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, was disclosed the day after the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Representatives.
Also on Thursday, Joseph Maguire, who is responsible for the Director of American Intelligence, testified before the Committee of Inquiry of the House of Representatives and explained how he dealt with the report of the Intelligence Officer.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did what the law requires.
He also stressed that he believed that the discussion with Greenland was an event "without precedent".
The Democrats in the committee of inquiry asked Maguire why he blocked access to Congress's report by the signaler; the director of the interview refused that he had no right to disclose its content, which is a confidential nature guaranteeing the so-called privilege of the executive.
A part of Maguire's hearing by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, given the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives launched an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump.
The day later, she assessed that the record of Trump's talks with Green confirms that the US president broke the electoral and security standards.
The right to vote in the United States to prohibit the use of foreign nationals.
However, the Justice Department considered that the president had not violated the electoral law. On Thursday, White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham said that there was "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of relations from the third hand and a set of press statements".
"The White House will continue to criticise this history of the media and false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana gets two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was given evidence that Ghana had reached the highest number of aviation safety surveillance points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent in the Temporary Implementation Rate (EI).
This was the case when ICAO completed its control of ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s General Audit Audit Programme.
The award in the field of protection was evidence of recognition of the country's high commitment to the implementation of ICAO's standards and protection protocols at the airports and in Ghana's airspace.
The award programme has been developed to support the ICAO initiative No Country Left Beyond.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 safety certificates have been granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and safety standards.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Ghana Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa were present.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiv Benard Aliu, stressed the need for Member States to maintain security in the airspace.
He stated that "it is important for us to constantly remind ourselves that even in the era of innovation, aviation safety and sustainable development must remain our basic priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were a huge achievement for the state's efforts, as they are a complement to the hard work and the sustainability of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country’s economy, saying, “Aeronautics has the potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection that we have managed to achieve."
FIGHT: He's tanked and ran away, he's also stealing a bike
A 50-year-old in the municipality, the order went to his audience under the distributor, tanked and left without paying.
That's how he stole gas stations several times.
A man also stole a bike from one of the overseas offices a month ago.
The owners of the gas station estimated losses of almost 1 thousand zł.
Owner of the stolen bike – for 2 thousand zł.
On Tuesday last Tuesday, one of the Zamora districts noticed on the Wyszyński Street, whose owner was suspected of stealing.
He was just looking for a 50-year-old.
The man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday, he heard allegations of fuel theft from four petrol stations and a bike.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
They also found a stolen bike.
The only one will be back to the owner soon.
For stealing a thief, he threatens the sentence of deprivation of liberty by the year 5.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when he attends a meeting of the Senate Sub-Commission on National Security on the FEMA's proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capitolian Mountain in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, American President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, acts as the head of the agency that oversees the government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has been operating without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March when Brock Long released this position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of State Security, which is subject to FEMA, found that Long was improperly using government vehicles to transport between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough check of his past revealed allegations that he was taking part in a fight at the bar.
Gaynor's appointment was expected.
To approve his appointment to this role, a majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served at sea level.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation of the finger
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the 2012 European Championships (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also Vice-President of Europe at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new nightmare and that one operation had already taken place immediately after the games in 2016, but that the pain had returned and the current season was very violent.
Pain causes me to put a different foot that changes my body’s system, causes other unnatural burdens, and causes me to feel pain elsewhere, for example in the biodegradation.
That's why I couldn't prepare enough for the world's championships, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I've been having trouble setting up the rings," said the runner on the NRK television channel antenna.
His father and coach, Gjert Ingebrigtsen, admitted that after long discussions with his son, they concluded that the only solution to not finish his career and participate in future Olympics in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only one, although the drastic solution and decision has already fallen.
"If part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik does not so much need this finger, and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the valley of San Gabriel – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel valley.
At the office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue, around 16:37, a raid was made, during which the police were looking for illegal e-papers containing marijuana and with large layers containing butane hashish oil – concentrate from Indian hemp.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, the officers also found a device used to supplement the ventilation contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vampire products is a potentially easy process.
"A simple electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the flame of these bases, causing not only fire, but because of concentration, even explosion," he says.
“If we have a lot of layers in the room and so on, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only fire, but also an explosion that could cause the entire complex to come out of the surface.
A task force was called into office to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently unknown.
The detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant, which led to the discovery of illegal activity.
Researchers continue to seek information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible took an interest in the place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officials want to be sure that illegal products have not reached the street, taking into account recent articles on the harmful effects of evaporation.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
“They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and to our children, so we always respect them before reaching out for this kind of thing.
Aphtin was withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided how to use the medicine for dance
The Chief Inspectorate for Medicinal Products has been informed of withdrawal from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used in the treatment of fungal and yeast infections of the mucous membranes of the mouth, infections of Gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used as an aid in treating infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because it did not comply with the requirements for the quality specification of the product’s odour and the decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztina.
Each month, GIF issues on average several decisions to withdraw a series of individual products from the market.
The series of medicinal products which have been placed on the market in Poland may be re-introduced to the market after evidence of safety has been provided.
There is no such possibility of withdrawal.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collection note about this nominally?
He wears 19 gold medals and displays the image of Ignace Jan Padrewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collection banknote will be introduced – the National Bank of Poland reported.
This is another banknote from the "Indemnity" series.
He's supposed to remember the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Factory.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignacy Jan Padrewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the PWPW falls.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the factory" - we read in the NBP communication.
The watermark represents an eagle image from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after independence.
The news is a holographic bar located on the floor of the window.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Padrewski, and next to the inscription "non-legislator" a stylized picture of the Order of the Eagle of the White.
This inscription, shown from the manuscript by Joseph Pilsudski, is a 100-year-old trade logo of Poland's independence.
In the wake of the wave, symbolizing fraternity and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect, was composed.
On the reverse banknote page is placed a gmach image of the factory on the background of contemporary Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the PWPW logo SPARK Live security and a palising bar, also visible in UV in the form of a repetition number of "19" and a shortcut of "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to be released on October 2, with up to 55,000 pieces.
One note will cost 80 gold.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from the special series, are a legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is much higher than that which can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, or more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transferred to a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded onto the boat.
From there he crossed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczynski votes for Malgorzat Gosiewska
The President of PiS Jarosław Kaczynski will vote for Malgorzat Gosiewska in the upcoming elections.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczynski and Malgorzata Gosiewska invited a photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, the Warsaw "three" boasted in the social media that it gained Kaczynski's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczynski supports Malgorzat Gosiewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader noted that he is a sensitive, sensitive person and is always ready to carry help.
"I shall give my vote to Malgorzat Gosiewska and I shall ask for the same," he appealed.
The shepherd runs to Seim from county 19. (Warsaw) and from third place on the list.
"One" is there alone Kaczynski, and the other is Mariusz Kaminski.
The Christmas Book Fairs are coming.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The people of Subcarpathia are said to be reading books.
We'll show that it's different," she said during a press conference on Tuesday.
And who's going to support the Reese reading this year?
As we have heard, the sister Anastasia will appear on the market, screaming at the first cook of the Rzečcipospoliti, as well as: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowski and Jakub Tzwiek.
In the autumn of the Millennium Hall, a great cultural event will take place – 22 and 23 November – to the shopping center, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fairs, which is one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and accounting offices from all over Poland will be on the auction.
There will be up to 30 of them, including Agora, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book news that the participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
Moreover, special meetings with the writers will be held during two days of trade.
This time, authors have been invited to write about important matters and not to be afraid to take on difficult topics, but they are also prestigious winners and... they are great cooks.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At this point, the participation in the auctions was confirmed, inter alia, by Lukasz Orbitowski – the winner of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wisniewski, the author of the bestseller "Solidity in the Network", and the king himself of the Polish criminal: Katarzyna Bonda.
This year's star will be the sister of Anastasia, author of several books (including cooking) that sold in over 4 million copies.
The exhibition of the missing Elżbita I dress in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver-necked dress made of the most remarkable silky camel has been artificially decorated with traps representing vegetation, animals and mollusks.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, it meant only one thing.
The blurry cloth hanging from 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church that she was looking at could only be the missing part of Elizabeth I’s wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn came across an exhibition on the altar fabric in Bacton in the county of Herefordshire, the missing Elžbieta dress is due to hit the exhibition next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises where the queen of the Tudor dynasty could wear it over 450 years ago.
The measure of the significance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dress only one element of 16th-century dress survived.
Although there is no overwhelming evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research have strengthened experts to believe that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebrogłów", incredibly the road of fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of the caught plants and flowers, later enriched by deer, dogs, mottles, fish and bears, indicates that the garment belonged to the most prominent of the people.
The dress, when it was heard, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, in the 16th century, at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals wearing such durable fabrics," Lynn says.
"As it is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at their dress.
It really made me very happy to see the dress, and they also admired it, and they were practically convinced that we had a royal wardrobe.
Long, life-long dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth of the court, has served the queen for the rest of her life and with which local legends have identified the actual fabric.
Although the dress arose after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parry family or to the paraphia to remember Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservatory work, four of which flowed on the most delicate hand-cuff with specially dyed jade and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric hit the exhibition next to the exhibition rented at the time of the Hatfield House portrait of "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous contemporary paintings depicting Elżbiet dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabrics, the art of the people who did it begins to be truly respected," says Libby Thompson, the head of conservatory work, most of which has been carried out for this purpose at the Hampton Court Palace – the only place large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace gobelins.
“Looking at the prison from the front and from the back, I began to feel great respect for those who had done it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed Poland's long-term foreign exchange rating on Friday at the level of "A-" – given in the Communication.
The outlook for the rating remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic and well diversified economic foundations, which are supported by a sound economic policy and a strong banking sector," we read in the Communication from the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch noted that Poland was at the summit of the cyclical cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the level of government and self-government deficits to GDP in the years 2020-2021 will remain below the threshold of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The debt ratio of the government and self-government sector to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5% according to the agency and will be lower in the coming years (average 48.3% in the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polish
The autumn round of Poland's 11 October ratings will end with S&P and Moody's.
Rating Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as issued by the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the level "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies in Poland, the highest rating of Moody's – at A2 level.
Rating Polish according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all assessments are stable.
What's a rating?
The rating agencies are set up to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
Rating is awarded to companies, banks and countries.
In the latter case, each assessment shall be made of economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but an assessment of creditworthiness.
On its basis, decisions are made on who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information also suggests that it is best not to give credit at all because there is a high risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest from credit.
Every evaluation must be justified and reasoned.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case, agencies risk losing their reputation.
More than 90 per cent of the world market for credit rating services is currently controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
"Fifth Confederation": After the first 1000 plus
"Five Confederations", the main foundations of the electoral programme, presented candidates for the 40th Round Summit in Koszalina for the mandate of the KW Confederation Freedom and Independence list.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, the leader of the Koszalinian list, presented the password "five confederations".
"For the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, for the second quick and fair courts, for the third cultural and educational bonus, for the fourth national security, for the fifth is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He noted that "Polanders must finally start making a decent start", which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the tax-free problem itself will be solved".
"The Poles need to make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list of "the 1000 plus programme for Poland".
On the other hand, Alexander Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, said that "life is becoming more and more quality" in order to change it, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to act for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederation is also talking about the cessation of the "stigmatisation of seed hemp".
Zadencka declared its support to the Confederation for the "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for 'Voluntary Vaccines'.
"The right to conscientious consent cannot be violated," she added.
Another candidates for the Cossalian District Summit stressed that the Confederation is behind the "deep reform of the judiciary", which should be an element in the discussion of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also argued that the education subsidy should be paid to schools without the help of governments, or, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The confederation is also "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Seimas stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
They also believe that easier access to weapons is needed.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gash coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, and we also need to consider going back to the idea of an atomic power plant," said the fifth on the electoral list Piotr Karpinski.
Mexico's cartel chief is behind one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported the morning drive for drugs.
Brian McKnight of the DEA has shown what is going on.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight found "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago from Mexico.
The DEA concentrates on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
"It is the most important priority for DEA and directly for federal executive agencies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The El Mencho Prize is worth $10 million.
He helped detect dozens of places in the jungle of the El Mencho drug labs.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the US via land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel mixed cocaine tones, methamphetamines and fentanyl-contaminated heroin.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a reward of $10 million.
As an irony, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he built a brutal cartel.
He's got a huge amount of weapons, RPG, 50-caliber weapons.
Basically he has his own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho is without punishment protecting his empire by using such measures as the shooting of a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this year.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the cocaine-pack lab, it's a brand of a smuggler.
For more than one third of them, the trail leads to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending the poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when a child dies, Donahue thinks there's a "great chance" that drugs come from El Mencho.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from overdose.
France: The 27-year-old blackmailed the French President and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macrono and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents compromising the presidential couple.
He asked the head of state for 300 thousand euros in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in France with the police said he received "explosive" documents from a person employed in the Palace of Elisha.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the President's couple, but their disclosure in general may pose a real threat to the safety of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he asked for 300 thousand euros – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in her previous marriage.
According to the prosecution, he refused to hand over the documents he was talking about.
He said he would pass them on to the media – but it is not known at the moment whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the review in this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but the doctors did not find any serious disorders in him.
PS4 game will be old-school – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debuting game available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, in a recent presentation State of Play, announced that the Prime Minister of the Sequel The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new breath tight in the chest playing with the upcoming action game.
More specifics were revealed in the days following the loud premiere of the play The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are getting old-school climates in a lot of ways.
We decided on something we haven't seen so often since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several plates.
Neil Drukmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in the revelational story given by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel grew to one of the most extensive games in history.
"Fabula is ambitious and inflamed in aspects where one was not," he said.
She had to be so extensive that she could present this kind of story with silent figures.
We weren't gonna make the biggest game, so it just happened.
"We're excited about how many possibilities we have in this story. There'll be a time when you'll think you're going to end up, but you'll think it's just the beginning and that a whole new chapter begins," Druckmann continues.
It's such an ambitious game that she doesn't fit into one of BluRays and she's on two plates.
In another place it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two Easter eggies about the content for adults (information provided by Gamespot).
We're not going to suck the surprises, but those appearing in the Eastern Eggi game are referring to the old-school works of Naughty Dog.
Learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two starts on February 21, 2020 only on PS4.
People with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premium, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the offer PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a pre-premier order for sequel, Sony has indicated that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing the replica of Elli's back and her bracelet and a 30-centimeter figure of this cult form.
Run, scratch and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskidi and will win.
The footballers of Stomil from three colleges are invincible.
At that time, Peter Zojozkovsky’s supporters won seven points because they won with Stalla Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match a unstoppable retreat fell in Suwalak.
Now the Olština team will take Podbeskidi on Saturday at 18 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to Extraklasa.
The closest rivals of Stomil take the fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the team from Olsztina.
The podbeskid on the excursions in this season played six times and counted after two victories, resignations and defeats.Natomov Stomil feels very good at his object – at the stadium near the Al. Pilsudski 69th team Piotra Znowizkovski won three times and lost once.
Together, in ten rows, the ossuaries collected 17 points and are in the front of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the play nothing said.
"Every change needs time to be achieved," explains Piotr Skiba.
“Well, finally something happened, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just got together for a ball game.
They're clean heads, they're a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomilo's footballers eliminated the Polish Disease Movement from the Puchara, but needed toys and a series of executions.
In the south Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because Coach Zanojzkovski allowed these key players to rest before the Saturday day with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, in Chorzow, he played back after the conjugation of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited door.
“It’s always nice to get a goal, and I’ve hit it yet so that we can continue to play in the bakeries (Moscow was equal to 3:3 in the 119th minute – red.).
My dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get the door, and I always told him that I was gonna shoot him at a time when he wouldn't expect to."
Now Moscow counts back to its basic composition, more than because of the yellow cards it cannot play Ołeh Tarasenko.
"After that, I work hard on training so that I can play in the first composition," says Moscow.
“I did everything in Chorz to present myself as best I could.
However, whether I'm playing or sitting on a spare bench, I'm going to support the team as well.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
We are sure to face a difficult encounter in which victory will have to be avoided, pursued and fought."
In the middle of the olština defense, Rafał Remish can still play, who has also recently acquired the injury, so we will find out only on Saturday, more than the fact that Coach Zajozkovski traditionally tries to keep his team secret until the end of the matter.
A man raped and murdered his sister
"You'll never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so reflective and so bad that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple indicated where the body was hiding.
"How could anyone do that to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, the uncle of the girl.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alex Whipple told.
"I would give up everything to meet her again, to hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same again," added a depressed woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotions during the interrogation.
Last month, he confessed to kidnapping, using sex, and murdering a girl.
The man's lawyer said his client was raised in a "familiar family".
He was supposed to be tortured as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to bear the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without being able to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would transfer almost $100 million of additional funds to the affected drought communities.
The money-supply programme for affected farmers will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of additives to farms will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for the support initiative for the communities affected by the drought, thus enabling farmers to receive up to $3000 in an emergency.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the affected community aid programme will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure and disaster-related assistance.
The new support package is an addendum to over $7 billion spent by the government on the drought control fund.
Frostpunk - a strategic game combining the production features of the city-builder type with a unique XIX-century society simulator and a frozen survivor – is approaching the planned 11 October premiere on consoles.
11 bit studios have made every effort to create a strategic game in which an intuitive and natural way can be played using a console controller.
Frostpunk: Console Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 was therefore built on some basic issues.
Among the main changes are the modeled control system and the updated user interface with new wheels of choice, quick access actions and convenient grouping available in the building game.
For all the console players who don't know Frostpunk, we have to introduce into the cold universe game in the form of a fabilia:
Frostpunk is a game of survival on the edge of a society in which heat means life, and each decision has its price.
The task of the player is to build on the frozen desert of the city, whose heart is a pair of generators.
Now a complex, strategic play, combined with a rich fabula and unparalleled survival experience, will be available on consoles.
Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.
In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
documentary: In China the number of divorces has doubled in the last decade.
The cause of this state of affairs was generally the third person.
More and more men maintain relations outside the country, which has led to the formation of a special industry in the country – a professional funeralist of lovers who want to save the marriages of betrayed wives.
Let's scan the sound: Ma-te-usz!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister to the Słaški Pekars
A special general test was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Moravian Mateusz in the Swiss Piekars.
"Your Honor, more louder, louder, so we do not welcome you here, Prime Minister!
Let's scan the sound, Ma-te-usz!", he encouraged the leaders.
Regrettably, the efforts of the enthusiastic wizard did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is in progress.
Politicians are driving all over the country, convincing voters.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki is also conducting an intensive campaign, which is a frequent guest in the region as the leader of the Silesian PiS list.
Each meeting is planned for the exact duration of the meeting, including the proper handling.
It was also, and rather, it was to be, in the Słeskie Caves.
The special guest should be particularly welcome.
Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, the manager of the room decided to conduct a general test.
There's nothing a vicious witch tried to encourage the crowd to scan the government's name.
"It will not be a greeting to me, only to Prime Minister Matthew Moravian!
Also louder, louder, my dear!" he encouraged the rationale.
Unfortunately, the crowd couldn't completely catch up with the hot mood leader and reluctantly replied to "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of the enthusiastic wizard makes a hole in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the House of Stays on 9 July 2014, requesting the disclosure of his wife's residence, Melanni Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris's office of the Countess Sheriff.
Only one member of the family survived, 15 years old then Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed she was severely injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, the jury members rejected the defense of Ronald Lee Haskell on the basis of illiteracy.
The left of the jury will meet again on Monday to issue a verdict.
The quantum internet is getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army's research move the quantum internet to a step closer.
Such a web could offer military security, detection and accuracy of the time-contained approach to network creation.
The Centre for Widespread Quantum Processing Military Information Research Laboratory for the Development of the Struggle of the U.S. Army has been looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state of space between matter and light – at a distance of 50 kilometres using light-signalling cables.
Crossing is a correlation that can arise between quantas such as cubes.
When two cubes are split and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the measure made on the other of them, even if the other cube is physically distant.
"These [50 kilometers] are two rows of size beyond the previous possible and this is an improbable distance to start building inter-urban quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist at Innsbruck University and the main researcher in the project, whose discovery was published in Nature magazine, Quantum Information.
Quantum interstellar networks would consist of the distant nodes of the physical cubes, which are intertwined with each other despite a long physical distance.
Researchers have found that this dispersal is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a step forward to achieve a widespread large-scale split state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing the military programme supporting these research.
At the end of the second cycle, the quality of the condition is also too high to meet some of the most difficult applications of the quantum networks.
The research team started an experiment with an atom of calcium trapped in a ion trap.
With the help of laser bonds, researchers entered the quantum state in ion, while at the same time encouraging him to emit the photon in which the quantum information was written.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of the light are fragmented.
The challenge is to send the photon to the lighthouse cable.
"The photo emitted by the ion of calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the lighthouse," said Lanyon.
Therefore, his team first sent a part of the light through the non-linear crystal lit by a powerful laser beam.
The length of the photon wave has been converted into the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a long distance – the current standard telecommunications length of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometre light-chain cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and the particles of light were still intertwined even after the length of the wave and the passage of that distance.
"The choice of calcium means that this result directs the way to create a mixed network of atomic clocks at high physical distances, as calcium can be co-ordinated with a high quality cube of "the watch".
The army is very interested in the wide-scale interlocking of watch networks due to the application of precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also co-sponsored the program.
