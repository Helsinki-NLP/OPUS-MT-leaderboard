Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
The members of the National Assembly of Wales are encouraged by a proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be taken up ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for pup.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'satisfied' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken as a short letter.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: 'Of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP received most of the support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and in a few weeks they will have to submit a draft legislation on the amendments.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they discuss legislation.
Citizens of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote or wish to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an attractive dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the People's Council on the Change of Names, said that he would not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
Speakers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, say that the name change is just the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silenced, Harlem's hard
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church in each corner before,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be found.'
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
‘People now have another way of social contact,’ he said.
"Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people go regularly."
However, he makes sure that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and early or late they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by flat apartment buildings where the kind of people would live that would not help in the rest of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will purchase flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being shut down even faster, because it is unlikely that people moving to such flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metro pool: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the leadership of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where black but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honorary Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beer.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Honorary Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, the beard proudly called 'the watches of the poor'.
The expert who played the ball in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first bee in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger bee of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and receivers, some rented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the bishop.
The Consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the bishop in July to express its concern that the bishop ‘would want to calculate the costs’ to the Consistency, although the Consistency was not involved in the hiring of the architects and receivers who had sent the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the bishop.
Haai wounds a 13-year-old who goes to cancers in California
Saturday, on the first day of the cancer season, a shark hit a 13-year-old boy who went to cancer in California.
The attack took place just 7 o’clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had slept with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with some others, he rode to the boy to draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was shouting because he had caught a cock, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: ‘I am praying!
I've been praying!'
His key leg was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to go out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he reportedly is in danger of life.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a couple of weeks earlier there was a shark spit in the neighborhood, but that it had been concluded at that time that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in supermarkets.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced into more shops the following year.
Investment in the beauty market is also the result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the networks where TVs, magnetons and interior items were once present.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first is opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and more often on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like supermarkets, now the supermarket chains take it up against discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened up a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have produced more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's test began in the year 2000 a collaboration with Boots, but the cooperation was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of the revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacies in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million UK pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of skin care luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our brand offer we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'fighting' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'fighting' because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company.
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their homewear brand and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is angry at Holly Willoughby, because at the last moment she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘aggravating’ when Willoughby on Tuesday at a difficult meeting in the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not have enough time for True, their homeware brand and accessories through her new contracts (with a value of another half million pounds).
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure her long-term future, and deliver enough for the next decade.
Everyone was blinded when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon scheduled.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, as a result of large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in the television production company Baldwin.
Willoughby will soon be the brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
One source from Jones' roundabout said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business matters.’
Hard Language “And then Love Was Between Us”
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media about a remark he made that some people would find 'unsuitable for a president' and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a reporter when he said:
'I didn't give up.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a ‘agreemental response’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We do very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to positive results, the rocket tests have been completed, hostages have been released, and the material surpluses of American military personnel have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to gain access to this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” said Trump, while he was in front of the public.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of deaths
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs heard that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer lived, there was no national disaster, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
'In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working on a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the aid providers from abroad can work on the spot.
Dr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly being plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but on other coasts you rarely see them.
That no tsunami warning virus was present in Palu, although it was a warning of force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances too, it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was hired in Lombok to deal with victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the scene of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's sealess infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent an enormous amount of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is struggling with a lack of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Yoko is also under pressure from persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the street, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides an impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday for the loss of Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He hit the left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the penal area, in the direction of the top right corner of the net.
He created Kepa Arizabalaga's jump and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, and I dared an effort. I didn't really think about it, I just jumped on the ball."
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The tops of The Blues shot the ball with its turn to Mateo Kovacic, after which he hurried through the middle field to the playing half of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a quick one-tweet on the middle field.
Then he gave a beautiful strike pass, which enabled Hazard to reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker van Liverpool in the net, next to the back of the deck.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes the Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Deadline of tsunamis in Indonesia: up to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 of last Friday, which also caused waves of 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old on suspicion of murder after the death of a woman
This morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact them if they have filmed anything through a Dashcam. They can have information that is essential to our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has heard from the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was silent when he discovered what had happened.
The residents will now hear that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came crying on the spot.
She just keeps saying, ‘What a shame!’
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the parking lot, and a third was just outside.
A number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building during the sale.
Who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'depressed' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visualization of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The icon class of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevails in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition.
Dr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Or that it is a completely correct idea, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and respected."
Murdered pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Lipuanshui in the province of Guizhou. His commander was crossed and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to enter pigs at a pig stable on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would say on Wednesday with his nephew from the neighboring province Yunnan was driven off to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his nephew found him dead and turned out to be open to a nearby pighouse.
According to the nephew, there was a big male pig with blood on his back in the pighole.
A forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer, the report said.
‘My nephew’s legs were bleeding and mutilated,’ said the nephew with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his brother.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on site.
Negotiations indicate that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are currently reporting compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
“They’re just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not about to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens now that she has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains in the coming days to the north of Mexico and to the south-west.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was on Sunday morning at 5 local time an hurricane of category 1, and was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to postpone Sunday to the north.
In the meantime, the Pacific, which is heading east toward the west coast of the United States, is beginning to take a foothold. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed north, to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching tide will cause widespread heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to a drop of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to go into the desert when the tropical rains threaten.
The heavy rainfall can turn ruins into desert rivers, and will cause local winds and dust.
The approaching pull brings local heavy rains to parts of the coast line of Southern California.
Raining of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small streams of dirt and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Spreaded tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday night until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread on Tuesday over the Four Corners and continue to fall on Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole is getting colder, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., it would be expected that October would start warm, with temperatures all around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York, it can become 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances are high at above average temperatures in the Eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh's impressive testimony, a candidate for the U.S. High Court, and Christine Blazey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack that claimed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while the regular programming was suspended for Friday's surprise: an agreement that was scheduled by the Senator of Arizona by Jeff Flake to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had bullied her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a testimony that he was 100% certain this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people who have been reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to find it difficult to count people looking at an office.
For comparison: it's about like for a football match or for the Oscar performance.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's appointment all, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: on average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that witnesses shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes down while he was being stabbed, live on CNN.
'I'm right here for you,' said one woman.
“Do you think he is telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters sent everything out alive when the judicial committee had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the idea that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominee by next week, something that the minority Democrats were urging.
Flake, among other things, was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union from a 'political game' with the future of Britain and the undermining of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said her proposal that Britain and the EU should receive charges for each other was ‘absolute’.
Shooting party Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Ditheon Simpson, 20, is under arrest and is in prison for suspicion of death, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with his death.
His loan is set at $350,000, says the Advocate.
The bodyguard of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death is a wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the criminal of the state police, the police of Southern University and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to an arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'action and pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm old and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won an average of 5.6 points last season and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team had been killed by Waydes.
"This is an event that you always hope will never happen," says Wade.
Vulcan spits as in Mexico City
The axis emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a 24-hour period.
The center detected several rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear as on autorots in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter Central Mexico.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists succeeded with the opposition police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the opposition police shelled the agents with eggs and dust paint, causing dark dust clouds to arise in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screenfighting broke out with the police, and the agents pulled their buttons up to stop the fight.
For more than an hour, they sing pro-independence groups: ‘Don't forget, don't forgive’, while their opponents shout ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the 1 October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the appearance was low and the people against divorce were the boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities last year, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police had tried to stop the vote in the polls in the region, which resulted in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on Saturday night on Saturday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was a failure, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success. Many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in forced exile or in prison, awaiting a trial on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mountant who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict by politicians was on both sides.
"The tensions are getting higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in temporary custody since the end of last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidacy for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after being framed by a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after a car was repeated in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday about 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building themselves had been damaged.
Perhaps at some point a crossbow was also fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga target
Dolly Menga's first target for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and concerned Steven Gerrard with his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's target made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
First, however, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has failed. The team has now won six matches in his department, and Coach Holt has not yet had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to achieve a breakthrough for the first time. Their direct way of playing took care of all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal point. Then Alan Lithgow, who scored Craig Halkett's headball, hit the top of the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be quiet and self-insured.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penal area.
At that time, the Rangers had been in trouble for a long time, but the defense of the housework was unmistakable and the target Liam Kelly had not much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a target.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a continuation of his colleagues from Livingston.
They continued to reach the prison area of Livingston, but they were denied every time. Twice a prison was refused, one after Halkett's attack on the attacker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston Phenomenal - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has been plowing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running the whole game on the tops of their teeth.
But the Rangers didn't know how to break.
Even though they played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their normal level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to turn the doorbell off once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better. They are somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they called on the 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and who is accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after crash by car
In London a biker died in a collision involving a car.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died instead.
A few months ago, another biker died in an accident involving a flight crime on Children Street, about two and a half miles from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said agents were about to inform the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed at different locations, buses are routed and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots injured in order interference
Six Cypriots were injured in an order disorder in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison bureau.
The riots broke out Sunday at about 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still underway.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ pirates are used to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The Cypriots were treated for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for the Prisoner said: ‘In particular, prison personnel have been trained for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible ones are at least referred to the police and perhaps have to stay behind the trail for longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison hospital was treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the opposition police were sent to prison for a serious order disorder involving personnel attacked with billiards.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa moves over the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already warned of sudden floods to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday right above Phoenix. Monday night it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘ since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of Phoenix 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a drop of 5 to 10 centimeters, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bay, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there it is possible 10 cm.
For areas where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial because the southwest is currently undergoing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current droughts are indicated makes at least 40 per cent of Arizona an extreme drought, the weather.com reported in one of the highest categories.
The trail of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
That is why it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains may occur in parts of Mexico, leading to a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then take place on Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
“The greatest danger that Rosa or her tail is expected is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain will be expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton at about 4 hours local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, thus the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has been among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh 'has been under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before the Congress and rejected the strong and emotional testimony of Christine Blazey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her action during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that the ‘American people’ saw Kavanaugh’s beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage that day.
"A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the many advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections.
“Over five weeks one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part,' he said.
‘That's why I come all over for great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'promote resistance and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a top member of the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths by Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and the toll are increasing
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the land being drowned when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of about six meters high hit the ground at the time it started to crash. Many people flocked and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses with him, he hit everything on the ground,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photos released by the disaster relief agency, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges torn down and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released at the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb that had occurred in the Second World War on Hiroshima.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, small bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be even greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala 'is completely flat, we do not have any information at all', Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,’ the Red Cross said in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'It's already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization got a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man screaming at the top floor of a building in panic to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are destroyed.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major flow disturbance that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the Evacués still have an urgent need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is open only for aid and is closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll of tsunamis rises to over 800.
It's very bad.
True, the World Vision employees from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office were searching for shelter in tents of blankets, but passengers on their way to taferes of destruction, Dosebah said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching relief, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and personnel abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing ones hoped that they would find their loved ones again, as in the miracles that people enjoy in terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a barn.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had previously taken place in Indonesia this month.
His students were also at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Dr. Gendon reported that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, only one gray angle appeared in his messages instead of two blue angles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while stocking cash machine in Newport on the Livee
Friday morning thieves steal $26,750 from an employee from Brink who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news report from the Newport police.
The driver had just placed a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, so the press report said, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Those who have information about the identity of the perpetrators are asked to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly named Ye and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons”, says the creator of the show.
You are not only abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier he told West that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', said West earlier this year, when he told Big Boy about the title of his album.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I have been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with West, has worked with and without the link sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use military forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces set fire to a peaceful campaign in the square, killing 300 people. Left student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from different departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be number one at the level of A.I. innovations.
‘Redouble the research budget for A.I. would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.’, Lee said.
A double of the funding may lead to a double of the chance that the next major implementation will take place for A.I. in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best American Othello player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed appreciation for the technology competitions organised by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
'China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that', Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best powers of universities in recent years to work with A.I..
Lee said that American efforts at the A.I. level would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Who doctorates at the level of A.I. should automatically receive a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national committee on artificial intelligence has been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in 'Nordic Macedonia', which would lead to a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for decades and which would no longer prevent the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province, also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour contains the country's claim to Greek territory, which is why Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he is not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rate of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: 'Are you a supporter of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
‘Representatives of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which makes it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The National Elections Committee said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
At that time, however, only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that were placed by people who had the referendum boycotts.
"We are NATO and the EU's advocates, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will make the necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is a supporter, because more than 80% of our citizens are a supporter of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after delivering his voice.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'an confirmation of our future'.
A statement published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required appearance.
From another heading, performed by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, the increase must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and escort
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shorted with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a bat of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first won the ball in the middle field.
He raced through three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was too fast for some others on the outskirts of Brighton's penal area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his court chair to beat target Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,’ Coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That was in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful crossroads along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball next to him and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tapped the ball just before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Schizer wants to join and make it not easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are yet consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They currently have one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have made at least one game-off game game card due to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but they want to do everything they can to ensure their first title.
“Although there is nothing more in it for us, at least we can point out with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play with that?
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but have been inclined to set up Scherser as a painter in such a situation.
Schizer, who would make his 34th start, was in the inbox on Thursday and would still pee the next Sunday, although that is normal for his rest day.
Washington's right-hand firefighter is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections.
“All we have accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections, and I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, so I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "promote and hinder us."
“And we have seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “malicious and false and false. ”
He named the name of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee for Justice, which led to a loud public boom.
"Do you know what she said?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who get that we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues such as this which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was the same during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I have been a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, today is not the show of many meetings and is the promise of a 'seriouser, softer' policy that has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew had a similar political look as I did, expected me to make a return and take a position I would never otherwise have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Even when I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are signs on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the next elections, which exposes the politics of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's all I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are about general politics.
I am under the impression of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexual or racist reactions every day, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is that severe shellfish are considered to be normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I have been given the advice to keep me busy for the past two years, not just to express my opinion, and then I would not come into trouble.
But for that I did not go into politics.
Since I was a member of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally broke my classroom, I have always prayed for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a congregation council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my policy hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my political positions and my current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, I have only one message, and that is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidature as a parliamentary member for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsuccessful Air on its way to the top
Two late attempts may have pulled the final result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Air is right to triumph in this great match of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now in the top of the class, the only failed team in the tenth.
Finally, it was their superior defense and their better chances of winning the housework, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
"We've had it so far, and we've still failed, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their chances better than we have.’
Grant Andersons try in the 14th minute, cut off by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Team (which he received during the Warriors) Melrose was able to talk the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo provided an extra lead penalty for Air and scored a conversion after a soloty net for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Air after the first half.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game was silent for a long time for a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was executed on a branch card, and as soon as the match was resumed, Air could continue to run through a trial by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the leader, Blair Macpherson of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again counted Melrose with the extra man, when no conversion followed a trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a match in which the pressure was very high.
However, the doorbell came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he hit Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the rising Air-Mall for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after restarting Kyle Rowe the box kick by David Armstrong's opening and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth attempt of the housework.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran is going out of Still Game in the corner. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already planning.
According to official data, he is the Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘floating restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Zeelui patrollers in a marine office in La Paz with equipment.
At public buildings, an ocean blue flag is armed.
On all sea bases from the Titicacamer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is of us.
It's a duty to win them back.'
In the whole of the country surrounding Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that the country has had to put away from Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict, is still alive, just as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific.
This hope has perhaps reached its highest point in the last decade, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead for Bolivia's benefit that, after decades of drunken talk, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who stands next year for a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the statement of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final judgement indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years the situation may have become even worse.
"The case around access to the sea was purchased by the current Bolivian government," Zárate said.
The war-sighted rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile may still have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk about this later.
Since 1962, the two countries have not had an ambassador to each other.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the Court's decision has been taken very quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will "have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual advantages", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crucifix.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utope' that the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get to the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head coverings, soon to be bought near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of crazy oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical watches were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their blind creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide four-dimensional edge hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other excess accessories were watermelons possessed with gemstones, a magic hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on high couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like on a melted ice.
And if you want to follow this stubborn fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the striped hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a stretchy beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that the bag combined.
The rodorane raffia bag, set off with raffia français and finished with a white leather pendant, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career chosen by them and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.'
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can derive that languages are listed above, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score.
Data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS show that 72 per cent of students received a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professionally as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A survey by the British Commission for Employment and Vocational Training in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, he will have a real benefit in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouTube score of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. France was the only language that stood out above 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach themselves.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are involved in providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages remain of vital importance in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game Sunday before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still need to determine how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked to make plans for the Lakers scheme for the six games prior to the season.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need a race before the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Periods of election rally of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of five planned rallyes of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are facing him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the High Court is pending, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
How late does the rally of Trump in West Virginia start tonight and how are you looking online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, started this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for the candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra charged now Kavanaugh is charged with sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more money.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes were intended next week to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
‘Congress control is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now as the busy campaign season begins,’ said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News said.
On Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the ranks.
‘It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the arrows,’ said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The staggering range of opportunities is a completely invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
“They had a six-point lead first, and now that’s just four more, so we find a little bit of happiness on our side at the moment,” said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that they have four points, while twelve are still at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored every three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical cone sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progress and he realized a crucial pit with which the match became a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two matches.
His pit with which they won the match at 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind that you can draw from that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game,’ Spieth said.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four to four and cannot do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoid bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way in which they seem to exchange energy with their rudimentary audience, they are the players who need to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who wins a European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is prepared to speak of a European victory.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson made short deals with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a retreat for the Spaniard and the Sweden that they did not get over.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duoes, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change.
The European team has so far played the best and has a good lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, something some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a great lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The haunted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which made it difficult for them to advance four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy they wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the dazzling Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer win back.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 single games of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points in line, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Molliwood' after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening matches.
After they had entered the four-balls, Woods and Patrick Reed were beautifully intertwined and defeated a disappointing Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5-4.
Woods, who was running through two games on Saturday, left a wonderful set, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven on the line.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kuepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it did not run from a rented roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas, three points on Saturday, set the standard for the Americans.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to collect a four-point setback at the beginning of the singles, although the Fury team has enough of the same game since they currently have the trophy in hand.
But now that she's been in second place for two days, an attack seems too high on Sunday.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will disarm unilaterally without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions led to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken 'essential goodwill measures' in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, decommissioning the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘We do not see, however, a corresponding response from the US,’ he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally.'
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a 'phased' approach to denuclearisation, which would reward North Korea as it took further steps, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation a priori, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the 'denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to alleviate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is pushing for 'denuclearisation first' and is increasing the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only strengthen us.'
Ri did not report plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the US leader had done earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party on this issue of South Korea's denuclearisation was rather than the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the American continent would be directed after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘raketman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should continue to denuclearize North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and firm until we have completed the complete, final, verified denuclearisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed uniform sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
In addition to the UN General Meeting, Pompeo had a meeting with Ri and said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea hanged him from setting 'walking demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take 'appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'agreemental measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and were taking steps towards normalizing Washington relations.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor stated that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, 'Why do I have to hear this now in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is first organised this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance and how they promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With the help of a landscape of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the choice of cigarettes has to do with their health, added Czeisler.
The culture of celebrating on a night's study still exists, he says, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students is a growing problem.
Concerns about adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the ‘secret weapon’ of the student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortage ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course. He had studied with the high school teacher last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and lightning lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: target of Menga makes the men of Gerard go down
The Rangers saw their race going down again disappointingly when Dolly Menga scored and the weakest team of Steven Gerrard beat up with 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first victory during a contest since they defeated St Johnstone in February with 4-1, but Gary Holt's team made sure of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard's manager in 18 matches. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continued to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equal.
The Rangers are now sinking to the sixth place, Livingston is rising to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a major injury after apparently an object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor's team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They crossed Air and went to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same 11th floor for Livingston, who tried to get rid of the Hearts last week. He would have been excited about the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have had most of their time, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga played the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free stairwell of Keaghan Jacobs reached the leader Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow fired at the back of the palace.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a penalty when he and Steven Lawless fought after a quarter, but divorcer Steven Thomson pushed away the Colombian request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former target at the Ibrox, could easily resist Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's stupid shot.
The director of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the length of the general game run, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold blood and chose Menga, who took the ball with ease.
Gerrard provided a break with the alternate Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racete away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play one of the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last phase of the game, but McGregor stood up and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came out of the corner wide.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the game for a penalty after an acceptance with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the German of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom you can COUNT well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name Geiger counter.
The geiger counter has since not to think about science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man, what the hell is that?
Rogers: ‘It is a geiger counter. It is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really messing up now!’
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

A woman who was treated with the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognise malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted to allow them to ‘see’ the HER2 protein, which is often present in all types of cancer.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulating the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to touch cancer cells has already been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West descends pro-Trump tiarad and carries MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was staged during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistency event in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would become President's candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pen on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he struck off a tiarat against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"How often do I talk to a white man who asks, 'How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He's a racist!'
When I was worried about racism, I was a long way away from America," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged attack that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
West's tiarat wasn't broadcast, but comical Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken under fire for his pet.
‘They have driven me backstage.
They said, 'Don't step on the stage with that pet.'
They tortured me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.'
From the audience came at least two arcs and the castemen of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard from a present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the implementation of number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU TO MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talkshow-presentator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just 'just himself, and that's beautiful.'
‘But I choose to reward someone who supports, supports and excites an ideology that harms my community, NOT by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’.
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We, too, added them.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the late musical Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formally known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder to strike in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complainant is expected to appear on Monday for the police judge in Belfast.
The indictment will be investigated by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Game or Thrones star Kit Harington extracts to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think that they need to be stuttered to get respect when they see such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he felt that ‘something was missing’ and asked how the problem of toxic manhood should be addressed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
'This is a very important question for me personally at the moment: where did it go wrong with our manhood?' he said.
'What did we learn from men when they grew up, which now makes us face this problem?'
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity by its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is born, and what is taught?’
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series was finished next summer, because he is ‘ready with battles and horses’.
From November on, Kit is playing in a Revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is the attacker.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his meeting with his wife Rose the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so I kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 to the property of the Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not so.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people in this way HIV is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said during a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been widespread.
According to studies, between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Sickness is often transferred by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and proceeds to ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘comploding theories’
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters is opposed to the allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the charges are spread by ‘extreme rights’ complaints and websites.
'False, lie and more common lies', Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate commission on the allegations of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate judge for the High Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts is linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, said Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," Waters said.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.'
Waters' statement has already sparked criticism online, including by former press worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds bad,’ Fleischer wrote.
"From here you can open that she does not have the temper to be Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not become angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the accused's motives.
He has to stay calm and calm."
Flesher appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on right Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take water's place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
He tweeted, "If it's true,"
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are known," she said, "and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members."
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British entry, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is indeed applicable to this Revival of the Johnny English-French, the comic action films with a sleepy spy in the lead, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 was brought back to life with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with eyelids and flexible faces manages to send everything in a hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic character that was intended for cinematographers in countries where a language other than English is spoken.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous glamorous, a little Clouseau, a wing Mr. Bean and a little of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson ever played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (who has forgotten everyone in the meantime) who always left a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval weaponry and the rotor blades just ticking against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor becomes weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Epip itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humour seems to be meant for children rather than for adults, and Johnny English's dark disaster comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain, to a great disengagement of the agent, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the ever pass by the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this character that Teresa May thinks of, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she has to employ a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the shocking Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but informally teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the espionages of English are thinking about what School of Rock does.
English is quickly offered on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former sad help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, a noisy and youthful role that lies below the level of Vicki Pepperdines.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the prime minister is unfortunately in favour of the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odyssey of lucid doll fun: dressed as superiors they set up a discreet French restaurant in fire, they kick a ladyship on board the luxury search of Volta and English detach pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but however well-meaning and inconsistent the scene is, she does something about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as in the other films of Johnny English, I wonder: can the British film sector really not think about the role that Rowan Atkinson’s talent plays?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan whereby Britain works four days a week, but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan that would allow Britain to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
According to the party, companies' bases would like to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day vacation.
In this way workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to strike the balance of the country is appropriate in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Associations of Trade Unions, which finds a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the same time, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the economy more balanced for the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has promised a four-day work week in the 2017 country election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
One Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not the party's policy intentions and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'faceless drivers' and the 'winners' in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get the full value of their share, as a Labour Government could apply 'deductions' on the basis of observed guava behaviour.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds, giving 10 per cent of the private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh may change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open here than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be solid.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is solid and the accusation should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be organized in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and that is an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting here.
Concertants wishing to make a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, making a telephone call, or generating another significant awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'cliticism', people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that should change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or co-sponsored.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom to 'help children realize their full potential'. This group promised Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history about the social injustice that is undernourished," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power or Nutrition, to support that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In response to one of the many questions on the Global Citizens website that asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, “It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fall.”
But, like civil rights and anti-aparity movements before us, we will finally be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to 'block' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington can 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the Navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to guests during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with no profit target that displays itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the United States.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels less or more," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate and replace the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For this reason, government officials of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw attention from the 'inadequate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trum van Berlin has made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexandr Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of Deutsche Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is struggling with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of Deutsche Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thought seriously after' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator of Massachusetts, said Saturday that she 'considered seriously' to participate in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about making myself elected president."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he was "senting that country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is bringing into our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own attachment does not consider it to be eligible in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said the senator was not supposed to be eligible, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty percent did, however, expect her to be selective.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin during a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took up service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son must do, what he does now that he is back, I understand for other families who experience the effects of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the public that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the father country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US that denies asylum to victims fleeing for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have last Friday as 'friend-of-het-hof' submitted a statement to the Washington Court of Justice in support of an asylum seeker who opposes this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union joined in August against federal policy, has not been announced.
She says her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people come from applying for asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the area of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "neglects ten years of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is set out in a statement by the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that deprives immigrants of access to the U.S. is damaging the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary workforce'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Assiel is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion", says Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get around the world every day.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became even worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined houses and searched for valuable items they could still use in their overnight possessions.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, unless they are damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressured against the rest of a wall," Haris told an associate press correspondent and added to this when he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and then I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an ad of four pages in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China were promoted, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last referred to China's paid annex Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, a charge that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to compete with the U.S. elections marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a rising campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a escalating trade war, where they have increasingly increased import prices.
China's remuneration fees early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government makes use of freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-lost tradition in America by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain divergent voices and will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have made possible on the difficult economic journey, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsletters refused to publish his article", if he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans expelled women's voters from just for the interim elections, warning analysts
Now many important republics are crambling around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the High Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will result in a backlog, particularly among women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this issue have been huge, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said that he wondered whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)'s attempt to appeal at the last moment for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and country spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans under control chose the Justice Commission to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, so reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can still go on, especially among women's voters in the outlying areas and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the president."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the High Court, analysts suggested that there could be a rebate if the Republicans were to press the appointment.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but also about the way the Republicans have done this and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, makes clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's testimony or probably believe in 35 percent or probably Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's sentence, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford explained last week to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court showed her his genitals during a party at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to hack with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists with contact persons, business lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be saved.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have discussions with "Facebook and Google about it or not introducing a complete transformation that puts all their business models on their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Spiritual and Carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I Honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in his place of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorable Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that the highest British military honor had fallen in part.
A memorial stone was uncovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said it was 'bright symbolic' that the stone was exposed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was different.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field shields and machine guns".
He later stormed over to the line of fire and led the line forward before he was alone to a field-protected edge and turned off three members of the attachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never tap on, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch an orderly Callator 206 and you won't get the most important moment to see.
The San Jose application card included 13 matches, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had been awake all night for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's regulations after 6:00 p.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed any more, so we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yess.
Scott Coker, President-in-Office of Bellator, said that they would adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom would be given a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were lots of text messages going back and forth and believing me, they weren't all as friendly.
We were trying to solve it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally have done, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic janitor Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual character, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me.'
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to his less value in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show, took a few months off because of the disease.
Apparently as a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to enjoy both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came to his senses.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and has used his presence at the Community Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "was totally surprised".
Daley married the Oscarner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has had the same height and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after having received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already got the cards for London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say you won't be there any more to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken fur.
Desert Island Discs is to be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his form again so as not to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who for the 12th time participates in the two-year event, a record, was put on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising the driving range, in an effort to find a place to which it is lagging.
Because he was never even known at the top of his career for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the rough rolling balls is punishing routinely.
And if the job on itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will always win the accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth match on Sunday, against which he is connected to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown to have confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back, beat his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but it's like it is and it's the way we had to do it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo on Sunday for the highest number of games played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Furik said his presence had a certain unfavourable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's busy, he likes to get jokes out with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him away from the crazy last week, which was funny to watch.
He has so much more to offer than his own game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single games on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dan made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as captain Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131.2.
"You remember yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after he saw the 2018 light win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's what this trophy is, and that's where we need to keep our focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go forward in this area.
Tomorrow, a new challenge is ahead.
Tomorrow, the individual performances come to an end, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your abilities as a golfer are just really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furik himself has experience with both sides of this kind on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel van Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he answered in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pecked his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get started well, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medina.
When we have the moment, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've tuned our line-up to this and we're sending the men on the way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to spell something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the offensive and puts Rory McIlroy into the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany has been postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into operation in 2014, replacing the older warships from the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The establishment of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that cites a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 are to replace the older Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put up the latest ferries up to two years later, away from home ports.
However, the continuous delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, have been obsolete by the time they are put into operation, that is the time.
The fatal F125 frigate took the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would render the warship useless if it were to be deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, thus reducing its performance and limiting the marine capacity to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extremely important because of the recent warnings that the German Navy is losing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, admitted that the Marine actually "has a shortage of usable ships".
The official said that the problem over time as a snowball had grown, because old ships were removed from the company but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new survey carried out on a farm in the highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how to use bats in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small funnel mouse, the brown big-eye mouse and the water mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats through the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat’s crates and what kind of action is taken.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to make such a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
In Scotland and the rest of the UK, bat populations have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning turbines can also pose a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Flying mice are not really blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out inspections of sleeping facilities and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Thrave we have a great setting for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and therefore the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to be able to do."
He stressed the importance of controlling bats before maintenance operations are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a place of sleep could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, which could eliminate a whole local population.
Flying mice are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall or disturb them, or to destroy their beds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and about many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges were published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called a few hours after the charges were reported, reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the subject.
I am a happy man, and by and by" added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called 'an irrevocable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the football room where he allegedly raped her, as read in the prosecution filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99%' good guy, but that he was sometimes left alone that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sex, but that this was mutually beneficial.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos have been taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extra-legal regime because she 'feared the consequences' and because she was concerned about 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the regime because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer to the Italian giant Juventus left in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' as auto producers
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that the 'like' was that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily put production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays at the border would be costly in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' job.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Britain crashed from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory still," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Oxford mini factory for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers worry about the risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes components arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be a lack of concern about the boundaries that industry considers likely to lead to delays and cuts in parts.
Toyota cannot save more than one day to stock in the factory in Derbyshire, as the company indicated, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exactly agreed to avoid border controls'.
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"The proof, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must be able to go on with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitive position of the company and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a representative of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting with Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'another week' while the fight over the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia assistants and possible obstruction of the judiciary by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to fire the deputy prosecutor-general and thereby endangers Mueller's independence has been under way for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to engage in talks with Trump and to put the president down through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round he was about to present his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced before Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to fire Rosenstein 'least not', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the mayor of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not a date for this week, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the High Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty in this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Hostess Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scariest of press conferences was not caused by a turning off of the 'early attracting' TV journalists, though, she added, "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without giving proof of this: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is endlessly much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks, and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why he made an open and bizarre appearance to the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has clearly declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also made preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know that these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and offer benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is safe and secure in your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency post-mortem surgery
The Tennessee State Tigers liner, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an early surgery yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27-lost fight against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennesseen reported.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and dropped in there a little or more," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was hit in total five times on Saturday before leaving the field, which made him hit this season in total 18 times.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK and the income is used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the number of vacancies is levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to cost £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bills when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this to multiple earners.
The increase in the number of gaps is raised on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional income being stifled in an effort by the government to combat rooflessness.
The premium, which comes above the current legislation, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects in this way to raise up to £ 120 million per year.
According to estimates, 13 per cent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, thus boosting prices and it is difficult for beginners to get a foot on the yard.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by purchasing land and not using it, and he called on May to eliminate quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'household scandal' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced an outstanding series of housing reforms, including renting ceilings and an end to 'without neglect'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as a prime minister on restoring the British Dream, that life becomes better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'last ambition' to ever be manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the club from northeastern England, currently in third place in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning the previous season to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team, and this was the end of the line," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw my father playing with Scotland often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps drawing me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, rather he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently being measured by 'can I get this club back to the Prime Minister League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it must undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross has just been in his career as manager for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did the best I could, I earned a reasonable amount of money and I knew a few reasonable points.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with every week.
I've still got that, given the stress and the pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in summer has made the revenues rise from British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rising by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business advisory office, who collected the figures, said: "Foreign sunlight and the fact that England was longer than expected to participate in the world championships meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had sold 2.8 per cent more, with the difference that the restaurants were now getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the sales of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that aimed at the sale of alcohol made the most of it, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people are just going out for a drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking turnover was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for trade in the output market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent per year-on-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a bad time for the food operators and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give it the necessary resuscitation."
Total sales growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion.
One of the five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden for their parents
One of the five children, only under 11 years of age, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has boosted the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a master account that they also show their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean master account that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to ' rape her'.
The study, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses) of independent schools, found that 40% of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elidh Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Sports
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Sports World, as non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am happy to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who is now regularly commenting on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time would be learned or I would recover and to what extent.
It has been awfully hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Advert for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad comparing mother-in-laws to cows that are milked.
In order to highlight the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, the producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, music video inspired ad to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to swallowing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hair-filled shed on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't notice it, these aren't smells, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then follows with: 'Fowls, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.'
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, directly provided an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions of viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is being compared.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of the order" is written in a reply.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding beehive (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noticed: "This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product" wrote someone.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at mothers who swallow (often at work or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being just 'cow'.
This announcement is not entirely positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who swallow feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, does not have wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a feeding beehive, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on hooks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is a dermate revolutionary product that it deserved a stuttering and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between pumping mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the pump and the corresponding challenges in the lighters and at the same time show in a supportive and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-humid rhetoric and hard-humid policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to provide children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by registering for a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of those sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We are in pursuit of these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules which oblige some of them to appear before the court within a month of the commencement of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shipyard.
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, instead of in person, to file their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the workers at the shipyard and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a greater facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is fighting are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them have been fighting with.
Syria orders the US, France and Turkey 'occupational power' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mullem also called back the Syrian refugees, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, in the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he understands 'to spread some Western countries irrational fears' which keep most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important Bolshevik of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has led to a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including combatants of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would 'be eliminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
At the same time, it made clear what the terms of the Syrian Government's participation in the committee were and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and it warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency was provisionally terminated by a dismissal procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at CNN during 'primary-time' has more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' by MSNBC is at the top of the ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's a value of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories from Washington can influence or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the world economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you are aware that you have been looking at a panel of experts who discuss the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which it has about the pauper leather jacket of Paul Manafort that cost $15,000 ('a piece of clothing full of confusion' according to The Washington Post) and who are discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's about a reality show is partly that he stops you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role division of the Trump show and the daily plot exchangers (to win a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was looking inside to MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Court of Justice and the future of the High Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most pressing interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a redistribution of a electoral district that requires two representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is to be taken against another people's representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is familiar with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Court of Justice of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandation') for the benefit of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign financing between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a subtle victory in a well-known special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had won this district with 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and rejected this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in 2017 for controlling drugs, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While internal meetings were taking place, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic well-being as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some senior government officials indicated that they wanted the conference to go on, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible for the benefit of the conference.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned without further abrogation to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and who was also subject to anonymity.
Study history
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-operation of the justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly available.
Mueller's investigation is likely to also focus on the tension between the campaign of Trump and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress is changed in color, Trump should be responsible for that institution, just as he is prepared to go back to the electors, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court of law.
That is a hope of mist, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or that of its counterparts in Europe.
There will have to be choices by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only when the West had ordered resistance and Czecho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the inevitable threat of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with various of these kinds of bending points.
What will we do when Trump's deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein is released, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that, over the past year, he had suggested to enter into talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the High Court in spite of credible charges of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a weasel was painted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on a visit on Thursday and know that a win on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Because of a knee injury, middleman Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the outcome as a jumpboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good eleven," said the 31st.
"We entered the game with the idea that something was going down and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end, but the whole game is probably a fair match.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we got out in the second half, we were the best team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it is going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last match, but when the public is behind us, I am sure that we can push through and that we can get a positive result.
Last year must have been heavy, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the way in which they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if your wishes do not indicate well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor into the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options, among other things, can be a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Place your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be used.
Take care of a health care authority, so that you can identify a trusted person who can supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals will abide by your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and make sure that the invoices are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan so that you can handle the information.
"It's not only the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, forty plus, was located in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the decision, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'optional act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the expectation is that the number will rise further.
As the media have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Mid-Celebes and is at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The fourth city was the 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Dongala is an expense that extends more than 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
In 2017, an estimated population of 299,200 was estimated to have an administrative region just below a province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Middle-Celebes province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been regularly hit by tsunamis in the past hundred years by the Agency for the Combating of Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Atjeh.
2005: A series of serious earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An in-depth earthquake struck Pidie in Atheh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made sure that thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's oldest son, former Governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, is arrested for domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he removed the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody in the Mat-Su storage house with a bailout of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, sure to know' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now pending before Alaska's vet court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016, after linking the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, which he would have retained at his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on Richter's scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been turned off while the expectation is that the death rate will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place right next to the centre of Celebes, which lies north-east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfoello Saypov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Saypov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, with pedestrians and bikers coming on his way about in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intendedly' killed the eight victims and 'intendedly' suffered serious physical injury, according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is claimed, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The death penalty is possible for both charges, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Saypov carried out the attack as 'cruel, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that a case involving the death penalty occurred in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, gave no evidence of revenge in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigators know he felt good about his act, the police.
Saypov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police said.
He did not claim to be guilty of charge with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saypov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Today Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise a more populous army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Ukip's former leader said that politicians must feel the "hot" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own Members proposed to guide them in the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK 'would already be there' if Mr. Farage Brexit was Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the highly divided leaders is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister fights to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Fellow Members felt that they would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels in spite of the oppositions, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Checkers in the trash.'
He suggested that Farage should be corrected and that it should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the job, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The parliamentary member for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the garbage dump."
In explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
It is worth suggesting that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed their mind and wants to remain in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: prime minister, listen to people.
Chequers is unpopular with the large public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure that we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the "hot" if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to betray our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, to put the fire on the rails.
We are mobilising the people's army of this country that has given us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swam with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after establishing this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Upper House for Labour, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planting 'good to go' on presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll think 'good about her presidential candidacy' after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republican delegation who was co-chairman of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would make herself eligible for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our faulty government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave free video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who is seen in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died of its consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to have been present at the scene of the crime, to be in possession of a firearm and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that a team of Mercedes orders would play a part in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from the pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel entered the pit and left Hamilton in the busy rides in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-on-wheel action whereby the Ferrari driver with opposite space had to release on the inside after a double movement in the third bend.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was the seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his band selection and mixed up on fast finish, so that he could get Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pit, until he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valteri did his best all weekend.
The team did its best for the seats one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump scoffed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she did not continue to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, in which the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly have it on the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he indicated that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, dishonest and dishonest'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the press and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it.
You know what?
Diane Feinstein, did you read?
You still know her answer... you read the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't." He added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the charges to Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I haven't kept Dr. Ford's charges hidden, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidentially to go and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial and he commented on it at the Saturday evening meeting: "I'll tell you something, that wasn't good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further to his defence of the High Court candidate, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the immorality, they don't give anything to who they hurt, to whom they should drive to seize the power and regain control," the president would have said according to a mediate report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by the scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the household by the side before Dwyer brought the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals assured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a retreat on Friday night to beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening shot came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. on an assistant from Kendall McFull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvilier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the sequel to Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants enjoyed the first rest in advance, when he made his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a stand with a power-play ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the win with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agg refused to leave his post in the wild-and-again mobile traffic operators of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready on the runway, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic jams, when he thought it was crashing.
He died in the hospital later.
Johannes Sirat, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to the thousands and informed the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the mortality rate is still rising because many bodies are under the dirt and have not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The retail markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is built in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Yoko Widodo of Indonesia arrived Sunday in Palu and said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people dying.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that ran the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that another man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was hit by water during landing at the Chuukeland airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact sequence of events remains unclear for the time being.
The air carrier and the US Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the landing path has been missing.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that he and some others managed to swim in the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the supporters were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that mariners who were at work in the vicinity also helped with rescue operations by taking people to the coast with a blowable boat, before the plane sank further in about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last twenty years 111 people have died in air carrier crashes registered with the PNG, but that does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
On Friday, the prosecutor concluded a petitioner in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, presented an hour-long testimony as a witness-expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be at his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him that he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was then in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they knew each other just one week.
Rowlett said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," Hale said.
The defense starts on Sunday with the slot arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the day after the talks.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hippop'?
A hypoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hyphop is alien from the origin of political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the root and make 'conscious hippop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a new experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-based teenage girl challenges a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York-based midwife is seeking a divorce for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'such a black weather'.
The couple denies being a racist and calls the case 'dispersing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, showed her disassociation when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NOEEE WATER SO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman, who felt "uneasy" when she realized her blindness, said that their former African-American infantry had done a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice is the couple for the court to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to buoy up with the family, even without contract.
'I want them to feel like you're just not doing this,' Maurice said last Friday in New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple hesitated with regard to the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid, by insulting her, that they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists', husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
It's going out.'
Comparing the case to 'persecution', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
Did you go after someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic, added the investment banker.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where it is held out for their behaviour and reasoning.
The editors of Paddington feared that the public would have little interest in a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: 'It is difficult to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's enormous success, it's very comfortable.'
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, when a cameraman worked with the British broadcaster BBC, he was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "Bittersweet" felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so vital to him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud of yourself while you didn't do anything for it.
I think he was so successful about Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he made the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were vainly trying to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then came Nad's phone to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped were slowly developing and leaving her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't grieve, cry, or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really needed to be big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving over the death of her daughter, was on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test she had to face.
'No one knew,' she said.
'I sat down with my head down and the tears were still coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide are strong enough to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any older person to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney, in the English county Gloucestershire, tells that her son was a promising chef with an amazing greenery.
'He was famous for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs. Davis said, 'I keep making sure there's a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it.'
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sombre or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children took out their gifts he didn't look at them at all or so.'
She said his death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to deal with it: 'It's the whole family apart.
It's driving us down.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaughs' future uncertain while the FBI's investigation starts
'I thought that if we could really get what he asks for, a research limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, who added that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, in the midst of a firmly anchored fit within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been over five weeks, on 6 November and if, as the Republicans are expected to do, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to issue the ruling vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the High Court.
Number of passersby in North Korea 'down 'under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean passers-bys to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Einvording, states that there were 1,127 passers-bys last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park states that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers are the most important factors for the decline.
Pyongyang did not respond in public.
The vast majority of the passers-by from North Korea is finally offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarised Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the passersby to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often puts them out with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which discussed in particular the stagnated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, when they agreed in large lines to work on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of lack of progress in lifting US sanctions.
'Without faith in the U.S. action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step towards unilateral disarmament', Mr Ri said during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh ' hysterical' and finds him unfit to serve in the High Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, appointed candidate judge for the U.S. High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh ' hysterical', and finds him unable to serve in the High Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman acted like this, it would be called her ' hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was excited to deny the charges that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes yelled almost and was especially local when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him 'big and coordinated murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the High Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he's disqualificating himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to impose an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Members.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth at Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the High Court, but also for the court where he is now serving," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia District Court (usually abbreviation D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade'.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the revision of certain decisions of the High Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand juicy if now a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed in the High Court,' said Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tiarad of months and years of hardened anger that goes through, and she can only cry to get it out.
'We're gonna cry when we get angry,' Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
'I don't think that's weird, do you?'
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was leading somewhere and who told me that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method that always when she got angry went crying. She said to the one she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she just cried.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because tears are essentially not understood.
One of my best memories left from a previous job, in an office dominated by men, was when I had to cry awfully because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a guy who was a little afraid of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let her see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they got you in the box.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was established in an external case on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catswad' or 'outline') and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not apply.
'It wasn't a well-considered decision,' she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign had already been advanced, she was behind with fundraiser, and so she formally did not promise to do so if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, only wanted to give her $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of MEPs, and of anger about sexism - that she stuck in it.
'You will have thought that I had a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media reacted to her.
'They'll have thought that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war can be decomposed for Beijing
The opening of the U.S. trade war between China and the United States was overwhelming, and although the fight has not yet been fought, a gap could be drawn between the two countries according to experts in the long term for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China from the US.
Peking has taken reprisals in nature every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5% to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the world's worlds on a larger economy will probably not cut their eyes off quickly.
To let Washington bow, requests must be granted, but public bowing for the US is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing the smart, trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could bring one of the two countries into an economic free fall, is indeed much more dangerous than observers have previously recognised,' says Abigail Grace, a research associate of the Center for a New American Security, a thought specialist in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, as Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the situation in his country is improving.
'Today the situation in the country is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism', he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwestern of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup in Europe has not won since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn received the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the whole tournament fighting, allowed his long beat from tea to water at par. 3, holes 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-ranking player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 holes to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which could be the last game played in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, was once the best European player of all tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
'I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the torch to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who goes to beat the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I followed that guy when I grew up,' said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the largest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level in the entire tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We're offering opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You need to take off your hat for the opponent.
We've lost.'
