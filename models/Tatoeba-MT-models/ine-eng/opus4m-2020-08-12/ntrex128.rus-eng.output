Members of the Wales Assembly don't want to “mapping”
Some members of the National Assembly find it unsatisfactory to adopt the proposal for their abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Wales Parliament).
The problem is related to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes about this abbreviation.
One of the liborists, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in the Valais Twp it means “tubice”, but pwp means “cake”.
According to a member of the Assembly of the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “not satisfied” and offered other options.
The representatives of the Conservative Party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the word Muppet (map).
In this context, the letter w in the Valais language is expressed as a letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on how to appoint Members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind them”.
The Wells Administration Act 2017 empowers the Wales National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which Parliament Wells instead of Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while MWP had received the largest public support.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are offering other options, but the chairman, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a solution to all of them, bearing in mind that the draft Amendment Act should be submitted within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly shall vote for the final version of their appointment during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of name of their country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia declare the country to be “the Republic of North Macedonia”.
The international vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province and has repeatedly been opposed to the entry of its northern neighbour into the Euro Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, George Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize its results.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the country's name is the most recent price of EU and NATO accession.
The Garlem Income Crisis: St. Martin's Coloquial Silence Forever
“The guards of the area I was talking to said that there was a bar and a church on each corner before, ” says Adams.
There is nothing left.
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as:
“The format of communication has changed”.
“Bar stopped being a kind of guest of the entire area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to the churches, it is worrying that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough to be trusted by their leaders. “They will be left with nothing sooner or later.”
At the church’s site, he added, there would be a multi-dwelling house whose residents would not be able to maintain their incomes in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “And this will be about the day when such churches will be finally closed, because new neighbors will never be their residents.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first members of the Methodist Church left their mark in the 1930 ’ s.
Their building was redeemed by the black income available to the neighbors.
When St. Martin's Church went into the hands of the black community, it was headed by the distinguished John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, the main commercial artery of Harlem, where they refused to take up work or to increase the service of the black people.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered significant damage, and during the restoration work, Father Johnson ordered the installation of the carilon.
Blessed David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the carilon “the cologne of the poor. ”
But the expert who tested the carilon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool”.
An expert at Michigan University Tiffany Ng also noted that St. Martin's carilon was the world's first instrument of its kind, played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind. 18 years ago he was invited to play at the largest carilon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuezer, St. Martin’s church has not yet been replaced.
For the last few months around St. Martin’s Church, a complex situation has arisen with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the world’s leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The meeting of the members, the governing body of the comings of world leaders, in July came to the eparchy, expressing concern that the eparchy “trying to translate the cost of work” to the eparchy of the members, although the latter had no relation to the choice of architects and contractors to the eparchy.
Some members expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the epariah.
In California, the shark wounded a 13-year-old lunatic who was a lobbyist
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster Hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California attacked the shark and suffered bodily damage.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bikon Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he snorted with his friends and about half an hour later heard the boy’s cry for help, and they boarded the boat and pulled a teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first decided that the boy was very happy with the reputation of a lobbyist, but he quickly realized that he had been shouting, “I’ve been eaten!
They've given me a taste of it."
After swimming to the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely broken the skin around the key”.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, "Here's the shark," says Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Reddy's Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The species of shark that attacks a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, during a press briefing, reported that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this place, but was not taken to dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had suffered injuries in the upper part of the tunnel.
The authorities have covered the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there were 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sensbury plans to submit to the perfume and cosmetic market of the United Kingdom
Sensbury is about to establish cosmetics and perfumery departments in shops in Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams with cosmetic consultants, on the model of luxury universities.
The British Perfumer Cosmetic Market is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to expand, while fashion and home products are falling. In order to capture a large proportion of this desired market as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country, space departments of cosmetics and perfumery will be represented and should be expected in many other shops next year.
The owners of supermarkets are seeking to fill up the earlier TV stations, microwave ovens, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to increase the two range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will be presented in more specially designated locations, such as the organization of goods in shops in Butts.
In addition, a company liner for Butique-Cosmetics products will be reorganized with a switch to the products for vegas to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinsbury shops will feature a kiosk of Fragrance Shop, the first of which has already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second opening is expected in Sally Oak, Birmingham this year.
Internet trade and the tendency to buy small products per day in small boxes near the house resulted in the need for supermarkets to attract customers in other ways.
Mike Coup, President of Seinsbury, says that slots are gradually becoming universagates, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets are located in Argos’ outlets, and some of them can now be found at Habitats’ stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago, which has led to a rise in sales of food and jewelry from these acquisitions.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint company, Seinsbury and Butts, was organized, but there was still disagreement between the parties on the income section of the sales of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 stores) by Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, at 125 million pounds of sterling three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury care facilities for the skin of La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sensbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help the Council.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of shops will attract many visitors in the search for cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of the origin of shops.”
Peter Jones replied in anger to Holly Willowby's exit from the 11 million pounds deal
The star of the "Logo Dragon" show Peter Jones was "raveled" by TV director Holly Willowby from a 11 million pounds sterling deal she was supposed to conclude with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint homewear brand and True accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of the actresses of Guineat Peltrow.
The 37-year flagship programme “Etima morning” announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV led to Peter Jones' anger, the star of the Dragon League.
According to our sources, Jones was “disturbed” when a TV fan at a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that, after concluding new contracts, she did not have enough time for their common homewear brand and accessories.
The brand was compared to the child of the actress Guinette Peltrow by Goop, and it was expected that her sales would double the Willowby status, estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
The 37-year-old leader announced her departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left the United Kingdom on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
This was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the foothold of all the parties to the transaction.
Everyone was shocked by what happened on Tuesday, because the week before the trade mark was launched was considered to be weeks.
In the Marlow headquarters there was an entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the care of this morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, can reach a firm in millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as a potential delay in the launch of the line.
Moreover, it is the breakup of old friendships.
The three children who raised Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Taroy Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby created the True brand together with Tara Cape in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on vacation together, and in addition, John has 40 per cent of Dan Balduin's television company's shares.
Willowby will become an M&S Ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV broadcast “I’m Familiar”.
A source from the nearby county of Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Difficult negotiations, “and then we kissed each other”
He took note of the criticism that the media would be subjected to because of the “indecent President” comment and the positive assessment of North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
He said Trump, echoing the leading news vote.
“I did not give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Chen Yn was interested in the re-meeting after Trump called their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons stocks in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to an end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Li Yon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was still waiting for “responsive action” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures of the CDR.
Instead, the United States noted that the diplomat continued to use sanctions as a means of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The situation in North Korea is excellent,” he said.
“We were on the verge of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have a wonderful relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin have brought its fruit: the missile tests were terminated, hostages were released and the remaining U.S. soldiers also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was nothing strange.
“It would be easy for the president to behave so easily, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are going to crash into this completely killed room, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing out to the crowd that had gathered before him.
Tunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Disaster destruction recorded, victims accounted for hundreds
The first days after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboca population had been covered, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The Child Rescue Organization is preparing a mission to the Pala, but we do not know if a foreign group will be able to work in the field.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, Indonesia ' s leadership was assessing the situation in Pala to determine the relevance of international organizations.
In view of the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be badly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceha, they can rarely be found on other coastlines.
Despite the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palu to warn the population, which was likely to lead to so many casualties.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously in Lomboca to help the victims of the earthquake is sent to Pala, but the road to the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia ' s heavy infrastructure as the main point of his pre-election campaign and has spent countless resources to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, which was in the new round of office the following year, has become increasingly involved in financing problems.
The Presidents also criticise the deepening of interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of others were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machos, archers, and other self - gunmen.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims increased to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, reported to the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters on Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people remain under the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-ball earthquake on the Richter scale. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis of up to 6 metres high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Office during the press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380, 000, was devastated by the collapse of demolished houses.

The memory of Cromwell before Parliament's building sparked a heated debate on "rewrite history"
The "Existence" of Cromwell would be a well-deserved reward for the barbaric destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “a conspiracy” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate on the history of monuments, the issue of the statue of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
In addition, it has no bearing on the economic movement during the British Civil War.
Perhaps Oliver Cromwell is suffering from the sins of his forefather Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of man, which many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be the defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of the expert debate.
But it is certain that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected our country ' s subsequent development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a protector-lord are also worthy of high esteem and respect.”
A Chinese farmer killed a pig-killer
On one of the markets in South-West China, the farmer was a pig victim, local media reported.
The injured body of the victim (in the media only mentioned his name, "Yaan") with a broken artery was found next to a lion on the market in the district of Lupanshu province of Guichjou in southern China, as reported by Morning Post on Sunday.
The pigmeat is ready to be introduced to pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005, in the Chinese province of Zinin.
Juan and his twin brother came from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday and sold 15 pigs.
The next morning, the twin brother discovered the unsanitary body of Joanna, and the door to the neighboring pighouse was opened.
There was a huge drop of blood on the rail.
During the judicial and medical examination, it was found that the pig weighed 250 kilograms and threatened the farmer to die.
“My brother’s legs were hurt and broken, ” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the killed.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was isolated during the investigation to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of a farmer.
Cases of pigs ’ attacks on humans often occur.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and severely injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal lured a Wallian woman into a tractor and let go, only by scaring a successful woman.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon, U.S.A., was registered with his own pigs. According to the CBC News channel, a Canadian farmer, the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “spinning mechanism”.
"Pigs playing games,
They're biting and very curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply embrace your animal sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring floodwaters to a large part of the southwest of the United States
It is estimated that Hurricane Rosa is losing its power by moving through a colder zone on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring floods and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the South West of the United States.
As of Saturday morning, 5 hours from New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west of the city of Punta Euhenia (Mexico).
It is expected that the hurricane will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific is beginning to form a low-pressure zone that will move east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone, strong floods are expected in the coming days in the South West.
The sediments from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floodwaters, dirty streams and possible flooding in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity of the air, the precipitation rate may reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In certain South-West areas, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5-10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
In case of an existing risk of tropical flood, foot-and-mouth walk in the desert has serious consequences.
The lions can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunder can cause torrential winds to rise up.
The low-pressure zone on the southern coast of California will break the river.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of sediment, which can cause small dirt streams and create slum surfaces on the roads.
These are the first deposits since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and mornings, places in Arizona will experience tropical rains that spread to other territories until Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings.
On Tuesday, the river will pass through the four corners of the area and extend until noon.
In October, temperatures will fall sharply throughout the U.S. territory, due to the low Arctic air temperature at sufficiently high temperatures.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such severe temperature fluctuations will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State), and between St. Louis and De-Moons (Ayova State) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern United States territories in early October, the temperature is expected to reach 27 degrees in space from the South-East to the North-East.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States before mid-October.
Senate hearings on Judge Brett Kavano have seen more than 20 million observers
The testimony of Brett Kavano and Christina Blzy Ford, who accuses Kavano of attempted rape in the 1980s, attracted more than 20 million viewers to six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to Kavano's candidacy was unanticipated, and an urgent message was received in the media on Friday: Republican Jeff Flake insisted that the prosecutor's charges against the FBI for one week would be investigated.
As Ford stated in the hearings before the Senate's Legal Committee, she was 100 per cent convinced that Kawano was drunk and tried to break it up at a school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, claiming 100 per cent convinced that it was not.
According to the research agency Nielsen, Friday debates saw more than 20.4 million observers.
The Agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, has not yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen’s rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
For comparison, this is the middle audience following the American football player in the playoff or Oscar hand ceremony.
The largest audience was in Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Kavano: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, saw an average of 5.69 million observers, reported Nielsen.
Second, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reported.
After hearing the case, I didn't lose interest.
On Friday, the present drama was played with Jeff Flake's participation.
After the senator from Arizona, who was considered a moderate republican, reported his intention to support Kavano's candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to seal on the camera on Friday morning on their way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake met in an elevator with a group of activists who violated the senator's criticism.
The whole world has seen how he, with his eyes out, receives a shout from angry women in the direct atmosphere of the CNN.
One of them said: "I am standing by you."
"Do you think he is telling the country the truth?"
“The strength behind you, while so many women are powerless,” they tried to explain their position to women.
Flake replied to activists that his office had already prepared a statement, and he would comment on the subject at the Committee meeting.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee was ready to approve Kavano's candidacy for a judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting in a straight atmosphere.
However, Flake made one condition: to investigate the FBI's allegations against the candidate next week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flake claims to have changed his mind through the intervention of another Senator from the democracies of Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision, speaking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flekka ' s decision had had an effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve the Kavano without an investigation.
By order of President Trampa F.B., the investigation of charges against Kavano has been initiated.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" about the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the Euro Union, that they were putting co-operative interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published in one May interview, the former head of MIDI Boris Johnson criticised her so-called "Shashki" plan within Brexita, stating that the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU is “absolutely inappropriate”.
Wade Sims' death in a gunfight: Police arrested Daieton Simpson for suspecting the murder of the Forvard University of Louisiana State
Police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton-Ruza police, 20-year-old Dayeon Simpson was arrested and detained for murder.
The police published a video of the dragon with Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson DNA at the scene of the crime.
During the interview, Simpson admitted to having wounded Wade.
According to the Advocate publication, a $350,000 bet was made for Simpson.
The Crown of the Eastern Baton-Royal District issued a preliminary ruling on Friday: death was caused by a combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the State Police Laboratory, the South University Police and local residents who have been assisting in the conduct of the operational-research activities that have led to detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement for their “good work on the recruitment of a criminal”.
Six was only 20 years old.
The two-metre Forvard was the birthplace of Baton-Ruzza; his father Wayne also played the team of the University of Louisiana.
Last season Sims picked 5.6 points and made 2.6 selections on average for the match.
Coach Will Wade of the team made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused “shock” and “present woe” to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of, ” the coach added.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
Volcano Popocatepetl has fallen asleep in the ashes of the southern circumference of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico ' s National Centre for Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not come close to the volcano: 183 paragas emissions were recorded in the crater and during the day.
According to the Centre, nearby the volcano was often torn apart and felt threatened.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Soczymilo, social media users have published pictures of stork windows of cars covered with thin layers of ashes.
Following a 7.1 MW earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded the active volcanic activity in 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its own sake, Don Goyo) is an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists prior to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a multi-thousands meeting was held in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the exit of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps; there were no clashes between independence supporters and the police; six participants of the riots had been detained.
Police officers have taken up Protestant supporters of independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, have been holding back the order of the eggs and the dust of the grass, raising the cloud of darkness in the center of Barcelona.
After the police had released a duvet to hold the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For a number of hours, the leaders of independence said, "Let us not forget, let us not forgive," but their opposers replied, "Hail, Spain!"
According to local press reports, fourteen participants entered the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the exit of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists.
Catalonia, with a huge overhang, voted for the exit of Spain, but the appearance was low due to the fact that the opponents of the exit had mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to official Catalan sources, last year nearly 1,000 people were injured in attempts by the police to block a referendum on the country's electoral sites.
On Friday, separatists spent the night following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent its execution.
The demonstration still took place, but it took another route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narsis Termes, visiting a separatist meeting in his wife's company, feels that the hope of the acquisition of sovereignty by Catalonia is becoming more and more fragile.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents cried happily, having been given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a standby state, ” he says.
In the recent December elections in the local authorities, the Catalan parties, who are serving as a branch of Spain, were given an important victory, even with a small split, but this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either running away or in custody, waiting for the court for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old telephone technician who recorded a meeting in support of the police, said that the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Temperature',” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, since the end of last year in the pre-trial chamber, announced his intention to fight in the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in regular elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: The car broke into the house, all three of the partners were arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry had been torn apart several times by a car; the men in London had been arrested at the age of 33, 34 and 39.
The trip took place on Thursday about 19:30 at local time in the Ballinagarde Crescent area.
As a result of the tarana, the door was damaged and the building itself, reports the police inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that the car could have been shot out of the bow.
"Livingstone" victory over "Ringers" due to the goal of Mengi
The first goal of Dolly Mengi has been secured by the Livingston team.
Thanks to the death of the Lionstone ball, he won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the main coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerard, this is just the second defeat for 18 games.
The exact impact of Dolly Mengi on Gary Holt's team was compared with the Hibernian club in the starting table, where they share the second place.
Gerard's club was left without a victory to go out in this Premier League season, and they will meet with the leaders of the Harts group on Sunday, from which the Rangers will stand at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will be taking part in their European League matches with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
The Livingston Club continues its unparalleled series in the division, has already won six matches and has not received any defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as Chief Team Coach.
Missing moments for Livington in the face of heavy guests
Holta's interns had to keep an account from the start — the Rangers had obviously failed to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of defense, but the goal of his weak attempt didn't come out.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on the dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
Rangers were released, and Livingston took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson had made a transfer to Menge, who had been killed from the central position.
By that time, Rangers had been superior to the ball, but the protection of the host team was unavoidable, so the doorman Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second team continued on the same schedule, although Kelly had to break the strike from Alfred Morelos.
Allan McGregor's Ranger took a ball off Scott Pittman's foot, and Litgou made a broad supply from the standard.
The balls were constantly falling into the Livingston fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalty requirements — one for causing Glenn Middleton Halkett's spare game and the second by hand — were not met.
Livingston’s Phenomenal Game — Analysis
By BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, a report from Toni Macaroni Arena stadium
The phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingston team.
All the players were absolutely magnificent, and at the same time exceeded all expectations, continuing their descent to the Olympics.
Their game style and composition have not changed since they came up to the top of the rankings, and Coach Holt's great merit is that he has been mobilizing this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a wonderfully organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
But Rangers couldn't get into the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they didn't catch the sword, and they only managed to protect the host team once. Rangers, who are down in the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, there was a wonderful weather, and both of the seniors were in a good mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO countries, a visit, and without any conflict.
The heads of countries were unable to understand such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora is located outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousand crowd to enter the mosque, but many of Erdogan's supporters were nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opposers of the Erdogan regime, including Kurds, gathered to condemn Erdogan ' s policy in full as well as the German Government ' s decision to invite him with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the unique nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car crash led to the death of a biker
In London, the car was hit by a biker who ended up on the scene.
The accident took place near Beshud Street and Evelyn Street, a revitalized crossroads in the south-east part of the city of Depfort, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver and the ambulances were trying to help the biker, but the man was unconscious.
This is not the only accident with a fatal outcome in this area: only half a mile from the scene, on the Childers Street street, another biker was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
The London police report that work is currently under way to identify the victim and inform his immediate relatives.
As long as the roads are covered and the bus route is changed, the passengers are asked not to travel to the area.
Anomalies in Long-Lartin Prison: Six policemen injured
According to the Long-Laartine Administration, six police officers were injured during the riots committed in the men's prison.
In a man's prison of strict Long-Artin (Wustershire) regime, riots that have been committed at about 09:30 local times have continued since Sunday.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado group was called.
The police received minor injuries to the soft tissue of the person; medical assistance was provided to them on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained staff were recruited to permit the incident at the Long-Artin correctional facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be transferred to the police and their measure of repression may be altered for a longer time.”
Long-Lartin currently has over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had entered the hospital and had been attacked by one of the inmates.
And last October, the prison management was forced to involve a special mission unit to calm down the invading prisoners who had thrown billiards into the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can drown Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the area of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is “luckily”: at the beginning of the next week, the Hurricane Rosa, having made the last crack, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and the southern and eastern parts of the state of Nevada, in south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will cross the Phoenix on Tuesday and flow through the river on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “all ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) traveled 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it is 5 to 10 cm of sediment, reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Mogolon Rome plate.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible to fall to 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with a drop of 10 cm.
For areas with floodwaters on the side, the rain caused by Hurricane Rosa can be a blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
Although floodwaters may pose a danger, heavy rains can ease a dry season that is not in the South West.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona's territory is found to be at least dry (second by category)”, says the weather.com website.
At first, Hurricane Rosa is crashing into the Mexican state of Lower California.
As early as the morning of the resurrection, the hurricane, the maximum speed of which is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta Euchenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has occurred in a colder zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its force.
On the second afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category “tropical storm”.
In certain areas of Mexico, abundant floodwaters are expected to pass.
“In the territory of Lower California to the north-west Sonora can reach between 7 and 10 cm of sediment, with places up to 25 cm”, says weather.com.
In addition, Hurricane Rosa will head north through the territory of Mexico, and in the early morning it will arrive at the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category, and from Arizona it will arrive at the southern part of the state of Utah at the evening of Tuesday.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is due to strong floods in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west desert areas of the United States,” the National Weather Service reports.
The sediments are expected to cause dangerous floodwaters, dirty streams in the desert and possible flooding in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four suspects arrested for attempted murder
A 16-year-old in Somerset had severe stab wounds, and three young men and 20-year-olds were detained suspected of attempted murder.
The victim of severe injuries was found in the Excellence Terrace area of Midsomer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects were arrested in the Radstock area at 17, 18 and 20 years of age, reports the Avon and Somerset district police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of a crime that has any video footage on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "The whole hate, all the rage of the democrats has been broken on the Kavana"
“A voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and disturbing tactics applied by the democrats,” said Trump at a meeting of his comrades in Willing, West Virginia.
According to Trampa, in the process of approving the nomination of Kavano for the candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party has broken up.
On Thursday, Cavano gave a testimony at the U.S. Congress, categorically rejecting the charge by Kristina Blzy Ford that he sexually charged her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her indictment.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage ” of Kavano.
“Voice for the approval of Judge Kavano is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unquestioned public service list,” the president announced to the crowd of his fellow citizens in West Virginia.
In his speech, the President explicitly raised the question of the nomination of Kavano, referring to the importance of the presence of Republicans in the Congress and the House of Representatives.
“To the most important elections in our lives remains only five weeks.
I don’t participate in them, but that’s why I’m in a different race,” he said.
“I wear like an oven and fight for our excellent candidates.”
Trump believes that the democrats have set themselves up “by all means to resist us”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Senate to approve the candidacy must take place no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has killed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, many had suffered giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims of nature became hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in Palu. On Friday, on the coast of Zakat, waves reached the height of almost six meters, which braved everyone on their way and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running away immediately and lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disasters at the Jakarta press conference.
“The tsunamis didn’t come one, there were cars in the water, breeches, houses, nature destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and had been hit heavily on the shore.
Some of those present were taken to a tree that saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
There are damaged houses, shops, broken bridges and a heated sword in the aerial management of disaster management.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still rocking underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of the Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the earthquake caused the energy emissions of Hiroshima was approximately 200 times more than when the atomic bomb was bombed.
The tsunamis may have been stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
He called the damage “a large scale”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings; all injuries were received by 540 people, and 29 were still missing.
He added that victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast of about 300 km from Pala, in Dungala, which was closer to the earthquake epidemic.
Communication with Dungala was “completely destroyed, no information received”.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the Dungala area”, reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already moved to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a border”, says the report.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it had not reported time for tsunamis to arrive in Palu. However, it was believed that waves had reached the shore when the initial warning was still in force.
There was a loving video on social networks, in which a man on the top floor of the building shouted about the tsunamis that were going on, desperately trying to draw people to the street.
After a few minutes on the beach, the water wall is broken down, all the houses and cars are taken along.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this role.
Earthquake and tsunamis have resulted in major power stations being wrecked in Pala, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
Warplanes have been dispatched from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of the first need, reports government sources.
The city ' s airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights by October.
President Joco Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungala to Pala, where the staff found shelter in the bazaars in the courtyard of their office building.
“They have seen a great many houses destroyed, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities began to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complained that international NGOs had not been able to reach Pala.
Indonesian legislation allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organization staff only after the announcement of the site where the natural disaster hits the national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariani, Indonesian Red Cross Press Secretary.
“As soon as the Government announces a natural disaster to the nation, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the people who were missing still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will restore faith to the people to the best.
A little boy fell into a sewer hole was saved on Saturday.
On the Day of Resurrection, the rescuers pulled a woman out of the cracks of the building, who had spent two days there with her mother's breathless body.
Hendon Subandono, coach of the National Assembly of Indonesia on Paraplanism, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people who fell into a hunt at Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandag.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon recalls how, knowing of the rape of Roa Roo from other paraplanners, he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Pala who were resting at the beach festival for the next few hours.
However, his messages were presented with a series of jars, not two pigeons.
“This means that the communications have not been delivered”, he believes.
Steady theft $26,750 during ATM service in Newport-on-Lviv
On Friday morning, a total of $26,750 was seized by the bank accountant Brink's, who was managing one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Livia, says the Newport police press release.
According to researcher Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armoured minibus took the cash from the ATM located in a fun complex and was about to send it out with new notes.
At the time, “Brink’s officer fled from his back” and stole a wallet bag for ATM processing.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects had fled the scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information on these persons are requested to contact the Newport Police Office under number 859-292-3680.
Horse West: the rapper has changed its name
Rapper Kane West thought of himself as a new name: Yes.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter: "A person known earlier as Kanya West".
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and has even put it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
News of this appeared in advance of Kanya's broadcast of Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kana West will take the lead instead of Ariana's singer, who has cancelled her participation because of “emotional concerns”, reports the author of the talk.
West had previously stated that pseudonyms were not only a reduced version of his name, but also a religious one.
"Ye -- the most common word in the Bible -- it means "you," "you," so West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's me, it's us.
At first it was Kanya, which means "one," and now I'm the only one who is her, that is, the reflection of all the good, bad, unapproachable in us, all at once.
And the album is trying to figure out who we are."
Horse's not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddi or just Diddi, asked this year to call himself Love (“love”) or Braza Love (“British Love” or “British Love”).
A West rapper, J.Z., also changed his name several times: with a defacement and without, proper letters or strings.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
Mexico President Andrés Lopes Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending with a bloodbath.
Speaking on Saturday at the Square of Tlatelolko, President Lopes Obrador promised “never to resort to the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
In this place, on 2 October 1968, the students were first shot in the crowd during a peaceful demonstration, and the 300 people were killed, which took place in the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised support for Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to teach and open more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of perspectives of learning have led young people into the criminal world.
Financing for the development of FDI is required
China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (IIA) should not be underestimated — the United States should double investment in its scientific development, Li Caiaphas, investor and entrepreneur in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier declarations of work on II were made by several American ministries, although the United States as a whole did not have a clear strategy for the development of II.
At the same time, China presented its own plan in the past year: its goal is to become the first in II innovations by 2030.
“The increase in the II research budget twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next break in II,” Li said.
The increase in funding twice could double the chances that the next major achievement of II will be made in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Supreme Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Crimean Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest game in the U.S. Hotel and was then head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
He mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency's Defense Advanced Research Projects, and was interested in when the next competition would take place to help find people with a non-traditional mindset.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“China does not embrace academic leaders and corporations,” Li is convinced.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Are you sure that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence?
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to applicants in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published an artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences grants scientific funding similar to that of the National Research Fund and other government organizations providing money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below, Li claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Intelligence Centre, to which industrial and scientific partners should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, he is currently investing over $100 million a year in research II.
However, US legislation, which sought to establish the Commission on National Security on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians are voting on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday at a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “the Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, composed of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voters would meet the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised in the referendum was: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for entering organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, who lives in Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The amendment would require a two-thirds majority of the members of the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, it was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted for a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name of the country, which will pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the building of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene, disposing of chairs in front of the tents appointed by those citizens who are going to boycott a referendum.
“We want to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a high head, not through the thresholds of official offices,” Kavadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investment to Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country that the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO”, Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “the cornerstone of our well-being”.
The poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, but this was the desired result.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel found that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this figure is claimed to be positive.
For the referendum to take place, the vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major impact on the policy of the West Government since it came to power last May.
Note: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is protecting Briton to kill the target.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling fought for Briton, bringing Manchester City to victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit the target at the 65th minute, it seemed like it wasn't his job.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field.
He ran off between the three Briton defenders before breaking into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in green football.
He passed by one of the defenders and circled a few more down the coast of the Briton penal area.
He then handed over the Sterling ball to the left.
An English attacker in the criminal zone returned in one case to Aguero's ball, which hit the door of "Briton" Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the door.
“Aguero is experiencing some leg problems”, journalist Coach Manchester City said, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the target at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in fighting the Premier League.
That target was killed at 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero won the ball, being deep in the territory of Briton
He gave a great cut-off on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few deals before giving Sterling a transfer to a remote stand.
The attacker, the Blue Sky, killed the ball in the door just before leaving the field.
Manchester City fought with Hoffenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rein-Nekkar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick points at Colorado Rockys
After Washington Nationals got out of a playoff fight, there was no special reason to push events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if the Rocky Rocky is at one game of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, problems will start in the playoff.
By winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, Rokiz has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to be given a title in the first division.
“And although we are playing just like that, but at least we can keep our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the spectators and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss such a thing?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a drinker on Sunday, but it is reported that Sherzer is likely to be involved in the situation.
Sherzer, who's going to go out on the 34th, threw a ball on the sidewalk on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his way out, he's going to be a painter.
Washington Pitch Statistics - 18-7 with ERA 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump is running a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the presence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President made an explicit reference to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, the presidential nomination to the Supreme Court.
“All we have done is put on the map in November.
Five weeks remained before one of the most important choices in our life.
It's very, very important. I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using whatever means are necessary, and we observe humility and malice.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to go through to get power and control, and that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he claims, have set the goal of “resisting and hindering”.
“And you have been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “bad, bad, lying and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to Senator-Democratic Diane Finstein, which caused loud votes from the hall.

The Labour Party is no longer an organization with differing views.
It does not show tolerance for those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered a vote of disbelief to me, it was not a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who have not yet been told that we are not welcomed for what we are saying.
A similar attitude towards my colleague in Joan Ryan's Parliament, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, for the irony of fate, are issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the eight years of my stay as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party, the evening Friday meetings of the GC were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not consistent with those many meetings, and the promise of “more human and softer” policy has long been forgotten if at all.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Labour Party is becoming increasingly evident and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the Party to be led.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, began to expect me to change my views and take a position that I would never agree with — whether national security or a single EU market.
Every time I give my public address — and it is not important that I say it — there are a number of insults in the social networks that call for the abolition of the elections condemning the centre's policy, or that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not all that happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who daily face the flow of sexual or racist attacks, but never give up.
Most of all, this policy is disappointed by the fact that the number of such insults has become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every element of mistrust or change in the rules of choice of the party is already becoming.
In the last two years, I have received many recommendations calling for me to sit still and not to speak, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, as a school student repressed by the contemptuous attitude of the Tetcher Government, which caused my school class to literally break up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need them most — whether it is the work of a local MP or the Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political views, I've never done that in past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving so hard to Brexit, which is guaranteed to be an industrial, industrial and public uranium, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, and my voters do not care whether they are Labourers or not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that no threat to the abolition of election results or political convenience will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary for your sake.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament of the Nottingem East District
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible “Er ” comes first
Two late attempts may have caused some final results, but no doubt the Er won a triumph in this amazingly interesting tenent championship match.
They are now heading the table, the only unbeatable team of tens.
Finally, all thanks to their excellent protection and the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested for strength all this time, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve,” Peter Mercchi commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth honoring Er, they’ve done better for us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Klimo led to "Er" but a yellow card released for "Warrs" by the Scottish player Rory Husse allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught up with an unrealized attempt.
The climate increased the Er gap from the fine before, directly in the middle of the game, earned the score, and then, on the break, made a single attempt, with an account of 17-5 in favor of Er.
But Melrose began the second half well, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, made by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott that had grown, and after the re-emergence, the Er was further moved by the attempt of Stafford McDowell to realize the Klimo.
The current captain "Er" Blair McFerson then received a yellow card, and once again "Melrose" forced the opponents to pay a regular game for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of the period of intense pressure.
However, the owners returned, and when Stroan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the capture of Klimo without a ball with a fine line, Makferson made a tachdown behind the coming Er mill.
The climate has brought the advantage of not giving up virtually all the way out after Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the field owners.
The Still Game star is about to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hotel industry: it is known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis at the popular BBC show, which he writes to, and is filmed together with former comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the next ninth show would be the last one on the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning to live after Craiging.
According to official information, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kirnan is planning to participate in the prospering restaurant business in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: There is no way out of Bolivia, hoping that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Pase.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
Military bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a slogan: "Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring him back."
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked memory is still alive of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the 19th century bloody conflict due to resources; living and striving to swim again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become the bravest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decisions of the international court, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a mental balance and, of course, there is a positive outcome here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalsidilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process at the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of Bolivia ' s sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also looking forward to the decision to be taken on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific”, he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not take a decision for Bolivia, and if so, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to control the Chilean territory and has already stated that it will have no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the decision of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard, says that the case “was not difficult”, says Pas Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, Bolivia has not been taking any action, but it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed Chile’s last charity.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
These two countries have no diplomatic relationship since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was too quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an “exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit”, he claims.
Kalsidil also disagrees with the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the military-marriage problem as a political cossar.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he says.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure that we have to go beyond what we have done in the past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yon Ho, states that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it is able to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Rei spoke at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments were made as US Secretary-General Mike Pompey gradually returned to the path of revitalizing stupid nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yn.
Rei claims: the dream that the long-standing sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be put on his knees in the North is utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if the Pyrenees do not take significant disarmament steps before.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But skepticism about the serious rejection of the arsenal by the country, which is probably the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeii plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows demonstrate the newest line of mass main clothing that promises to appear in the media and will be carried directly by you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, you don't have to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual main clothes that were part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to fashion Weeks in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical traps won the popularity of Instagram signatories, and the designers decided to send their snowflakes to the stage.
The excellent example of Valentino: the main escape dress decorated with wide, peri-like fields was decorated on the heads of models.
Other mass accessories included decorated with precious stones of Arbusa, the witch's hat, and even pineapple, but all these main clothes were not intended for heating the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared to the world a collection of amazing masks, which had to be very much the same before Halloween.
Many of these cave masks were covered with lips, and they reminded more of the portrait of the Hannibal Lecturer than of the creation of a box.
One of the specimens recalled the underwater equipment with a tube and protective eyes, and the other, the frozen.
If you're a high-moderate worshiper, you're lucky.
Modern criticism predicts that these huge traps have every chance of entering the mass sale — directly to you.
The huge-sized shears go after the La Bomba fives, a fractured shear with a width of two feet, which everyone was wearing, from Ryanna to Emily Ratakovski.
A cult label that released this extremely impractical hat that won such widespread popularity in social networks gave birth to and sent out another huge accessory on the floor — a broken beach bag, almost as large as the one in the bathroom’s model, carrying that bag.
The orange bag of the beloved Rafia with a white leather handle and a Rafia scarf became a clear copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrityist Luke Armitaj tells FEMAIL: “I think that big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass next summer, because the designer has already produced such a fur by his products, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to citizens of peace
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: the excellent results of the exams have demonstrated individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other public-important disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), where over 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, where they seek to provide a higher level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education they have chosen, as well as for the status of peace-citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you will be able to understand.
If you speak with him in his native tongue, you will come to his heart.’
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relations with and trust the citizens of other countries.
As a result of this year's recent exams, we see that languages are leading positions in the league tables and have the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest rating “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that, in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered to be vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are currently being asked as well as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for employers ' difficulties in filling vacancies were lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly a key to a successful future career for young people.
In view of the fact that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student chooses, if he learns the second language, he will gain real advantage in the future, gaining another additional skill that will suit him for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 per cent were not able to speak well in a foreign language to support the conversation, and the French language was the only language with a two-percentage — 15 per cent of the respondents speak.
That is why investing in language education is so current.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In schools in Scotland, there is a wide variety of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a choice in independent schools from several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland seek to create a learning environment that will train and equip children with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages continue to be of vital importance in the future development of the country, so this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuted as Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The keen expectation of the fans to see Lebron James appear for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers, is almost over.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James was playing a pre-seasonally resurrected match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James was probably playing a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” says the game.
Tampa West Virginia pre-election race, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the nomination proposed to him as a Supreme Judge was postponed, Trump sought support in the forthcoming interim elections, for the Republicans were at risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
How long will the Trompa meeting be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willing, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Tromp meeting with West Virginia voters online on direct YouTube.
The Trump will probably be in the hearings held this week for the appointment of his candidate, Brett Kavano, to serve as the Supreme Judge. The proposal by Trump caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed until week before the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the November election Republicans to increase their pre-election rate.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings, which will be held next week, “to activate the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, for we are entering the tense pre-election season,” says the press secretary of the Trump pre-election campaign who refused to call, Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willing can attract supporters from "...Ogaio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Visiting the Trompo of West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit of the state in the past month, for it has benefited from more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who remains as a result of the interrogations.
“The fact that Morrisi should come to the president for questioning is a bad sign for Morrisi himself,” says Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia (Quota from Reuters).
Ryder 2018 Cup: United States Collector Demonstrates Willing to Fight and Gives Hope on Sunday for Men's Contest
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday game of two for two might have been exactly what Cube Ryder needed.
The transitional initiative is an excellent sport concept, but it is believed to be a game, and in such competitions it is particularly clear.
So who's got the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and 12 more on the horse.
In the view of the Spit, Americans feel “wind in the wigs”, and they have reason to keep their spirits high, not least thanks to the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each one can boast three points out of four.
The hospital was intact from you to the branch, as was the case with a personal example.
The winning votes became increasingly loud as he continued his round, throwing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the 15th hole, was met with a similar vote, one of those that speaks of his belief in the chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all the forces and focus on our own games,” Spit commented.
That's all that's left of the game.
Walk 18 lupus and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of Cube Ryder.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
Molivud was the only couple who did not worship a god on Saturdays, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday morning, and again on Friday morning.
Such a series and what their energy seems to be circulating between them and the non-existent sufferers, strengthens their faith that they will not be defeated on the Day of Resurrection, and when the sun falls behind the "Le Golf National" field, there will be no more significant game that will strengthen Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of the glory of Europe in advance.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson were quick to deal with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of a four-ball game when he was married to Alex Norren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine lunatics pulled out the Spanish and the Swedish, and they couldn't get out of it.
So no one will be able to help you out of your grave on the Day of Resurrection.
It is so attractive to watch the game in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange, which they deliberately reduce, and how the strategy can be changed in one instant.
So far, Europe has been playing better as a team and has been well ahead in the last day, but this Thursday also showed that the United States has all the power to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
At the end of the day, Cuba Ryder Europe is running with account 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage in the final day of Cuba Ryder after the end of the Saturday matches in four balls and four with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the struggle against two victories over Fighting Tiger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team's mistakes in the morning in four balls, winning with account 3-1.
The United States of America has provided more resistance on Thursdays, won two matches, but has not been able to reduce the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from the 12th of the dead to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European novelist to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the name Molliwood after the sensational departures, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reed broke up into four balls, they then brought together for victory over the fallen spirit of Woods and the American novelist Brison Decebmo with even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who had spent two Saturday matches, showed periodic bluffs, but now he lost 19 of the 29 matches in four, and the fourth was seven.
Justin Rose, who retired before the morning game in four balls, returned to his partner Henry Stanson on Thursday, winning Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka with account 2/1 taking the first and third seats in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk on the refreshing day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time champions Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas on Saturday were two points for Americans.
They won a decisive victory with account 2/1 over the Spanish John Ram and Ayan Polter in four balls and returned later to win Polter and Rory Makilro with account 4/3 on Thursday, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Ryder's team was out of four points, leaving alone, considering that the Ferrica team, as I own, had to play a destroy to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “categories” will not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing mistrust in the United States and that under no circumstances would his country give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho said to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial good will measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear site and the obligation not to build nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the same symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to act unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated the already sounding North Korean complaints of Washington ' s resistance to a phased denuclearization approach, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for its steps, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phenyan had done in the past.
Rei referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yn and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the US President-in-Office and North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to launch a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula”, and Trump promised North Korea a security guarantee.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States states that the Pyrenees must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the calls to weaken the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “first denuclearization must be done”, and increases the level of pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal and even oppose “the declaration of the end of the war”, says R.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that our continued sanctions are strengthening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mon Jee In, which took place in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea were on this side of denuclearization, and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be so stupid.”
However, the tone of Rei's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the goal of North Korea's rockets on the U.S. continent was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim a suicide missile.
This year, in the UN Trump, which threatened to “complete destruction” in North Korea, Kim praised his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much more was to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not indicate any time-limits for the process: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it has no meaning”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should promote the steps taken by the Beijing Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompey said in the UN Security Council Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council should continue to be active and mandatory until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has consistently stepped up its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of covering the funding of the Beijing nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeii met with Ri at the summit of the United Nations General Assembly and reported after that meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit failed.
In July he left Phenyan, said he had made progress, but for several hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “banditing demands”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, on its part, took “the appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke of were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to take special courses
A new course that was introduced this year at Harvard University helped all primary students to learn to sleep more and fight chauvinist culture of continuously consuming caffeine in order to cheer up “the night of the summer”.
One academic found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first of his kind in the United States.
After it was opened, it became a hot idea to introduce such a course, with a preliminary presentation on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, the girl came to me and said, ‘I’m very sorry that I only learned about this when I’m about to finish my education.’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — that it surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time proposed to students this year, describes how healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting success and how it improves the overall human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it had been found that students were experiencing serious sleep deprivation during the week of study.
It takes one hour for students to perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the course offers a picture of living rooms, where students who insist on coffee cup, cupboards, coaches, and books receive information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which cause a lack of sleep — affects sports results and how important it is to get sufficient sleep every day.
In another section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know as anyone else has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chaser.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “taste all night” is still widespread enough, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, sufficient sleep quality is the “secret weapon” of a student to cope with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight excessive weight, as insomnia translates the brain into hunger, making him experience a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visiting one of the courses last year during his first year of training in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the graduates to conduct a similar training program before entering the competition school.
Professor Chesler recommends that students establish a building warning that they should lie down and sleep, as well as bear in mind the harmful effects of “blue light”, released by electronic screens and LEDs, which violates the human biorith and leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga wins over the Gerard team
Rangers have survived a regular sad trip, as the goal of Dolly Menga has led Stephen Gerard's uncollected team to a 1-0 crash in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after the victory with a score of 4:1 in St. Johnston in February, but the Gary Holt team only beat Gerard out of 18 games as a manager, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their spirit, seemed not going to balance the account.
While Rangers has now fallen to sixth place, Livington has risen to third place, and only "Hibernian" has resigned from the ratio of head to head.
And Rangers may have additional problems after a line judge named Kalum Spence had to heal the wound on his head after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that went through "Er" to the semifinal for the Scottish League.
In turn, Holt went along with the same Libyan strategy 11, increasing the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-trained composition narrowed the opponents at every step.
Rangers may have been led by a sword, but Livingston was more likely to be hit by a ball.
They were supposed to kill naked in just two minutes when the first transfer to Meng Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector took advantage of the opportunity.
Kigan Jacobs had a fine shot at the captain of the Craig Halkett team, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the side of the post.
Rangers have taken control, but in the last three, there seems to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to be fined for forty-five minutes when he and Stephen Loules met, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two first-time hits, but the former Ibrox doorman, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Kulibali's head hit and Ovi Ejaria's weak hit.
Although Livi's first goal, killed at the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively by their own efforts.
But again, Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs with the standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried to transfer the ball to Menga to finish.
Gerard began to act on the break when he switched Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme semi-protector handed over his passport to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly remembered his line of arrest.
But Livington continued to attract guests into their intended game with Litgou and Halkett participating, making long-term transfers.
The Holt team was trying to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgou was transferred from the corner of the field.
The Rangers' backup game, Glenn Middlton, again demanded a fine after he met Jacobs, but Tomson refused again.
German: Founder of Geiger's Account
And now the page of our Resurrection Morning Almacha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the basics of science, Geiger's accountant also became one of the basics of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950's Colocola Coronado film, with the cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — such as the non-scientists — in the main roles:
The man said, "What kind of a trick is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earrings on, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "That's right now!"
Gaeger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, called in honor of his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see an anomalous cells
A new anti-inflammatory vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” an anomaly growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognise anomalous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” a type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, then cells must be returned to 0
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient whose vaccine was introduced and whose immune system had learned to recognise anomalous cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the patient’s immune cells and change them into laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are common to many types of cancer, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifesda, Maryland states: “The results we have are supposed to have had a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukaemia. It has been used in the collection of immune cells in patients and in their “learning” how to react to cancer cells.
Kana West took part in the defense of Trump in the MAGA trap after his appearance in SNL.
Everything went wrong.
Kanya West was attending a studio during the Saturday concert, at which he spoke for President Donald Trump of the United States, claiming that he would take that position again in 2020.
After performing his third song, entitled "The City of the Ghost", he performed what, he saw the hat "Make America a Big Again", the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," the executive said.
The SNL channel made a parade show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavano's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the statements by Christina Blaci Ford on sexual harassment.
The TV did not show how the crowd was upset by West’s statement, but this video was uploaded to social networks by comedy Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear if Rock was trying to make this move to make West laugh.
In addition, West appealed to the public about the fact that his hat had been ridiculed behind the scenes.
"They moved on to me behind the wall.
They say don't get out of this trap.
They were really moving on me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, “And they still said that my position is not cool.”
West continues: "Do you want to know what's not cool?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL acting group seemed to be lost, and one man said to the publication, “The whole study is in silence.”
West has been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days before.
Many have been tasked with playing Westom songs “I Love it” in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candy Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: A SUPPORT FOR MANY”.
The leading Karen Hunter on the show wrote on Twitter that West was just “who she is, and that’s absolutely amazing”.
“On the other hand, I do not want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing or otherwise by supporting his creativity) who, in my view, divides and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
“ Like us, ” she said.
Before the start of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “formally known as Kanya West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and walk on Diddy's feet, also known as Puff Daddy, Pappy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, Snup Dog's rapper was originally named Snup Lion, and as another example, of course, it is possible to bring up an executive who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist's name, previously known as Prince.
Attempt to charge the murder for being a minor at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of the restaurants in East Belfast on Friday ended one of his visitors with knife wounds.
The incident occurred in Balihacamore, as reported in the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The indictments will be examined by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The Star Table Games Kit Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role in the heavy medieval fantasy series HBO "The Games of the Thrones" by John Snow.
However, a recent 31-year-old actor has been hotly criticizing the hero-cat stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that in order to respect you, they must be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that he believed that something “was wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the “Pissal Game” movie, Rose Leslie, her rival, admitted that he was “very unbalanced” about the problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously: where have we been wrong with the perception of courage?” the actor asks.
"Why do we teach teenagers that today we have such a problem?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for this explosion of toxic courage because of too many muscle personalities.
The actor continues: “What is born, and what is acquired?
Why are young men taught on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, really, something's wrong.
He also acknowledged in the interview that he would not take part in any of the games or sycamores of the “Game of the Thrones” after the series ended next summer, stating that he had “suffered with battles and horses”.
As of November, Keith has played a leading role in the re-taking "Truth West" by Sam Shepard, who tells about the film producer and his brother, the kidnapper.
Actor recently announced that he believed that meeting Rose's wife was the best end of the Table Games for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” says the actor.
Rose played Gamerist, the subject of the passion of Kitt John Snow in a fantasy series worthy of Emmy’s prize.
The couple celebrated the wedding in June 2018 in the famous place of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, over 820,000 people are suffering from these diseases in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases of disease were transmitted by sex, indicating a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was practically zero, Chinese health representatives said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV is a major problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90 per cent of men having sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
In many cases the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxin Waters rejects information on the leak of information on the guilt of the senators of the Republic Party, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “the conspiracy theory”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday, rejected the accusation that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia side of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were made by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and an even more false lie, ” says Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the address and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hetch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate Commission on Sexual Prosecutions brought against a candidate at the Brett Kavano Supreme Court.
The escape took place some time after three senators were interrogated by Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of communications had been linked to the Waters office and reported on the Waters staff, says Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security had been compromised by these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak of that information.
This is an unsubstantiated lie.”
The Waters statement immediately criticised the Internet, including the former White House Secretary of the Ari Flesher.
“It’s an angry denial, ” Flescher writes.
“This means that the author has a temper that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When they accuse you of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself either.
And you shouldn't dig in the motives of the prosecutors either.
It will be cool and cool."
Fleischer seemed to have compared the Waters response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, whose critics accused him of being too angry at hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for Republicans who competed for Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
Waters writes in her statement that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will see to it that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English hits again — a weak parade of spy Rowen Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to search for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the United Kingdom appears in some way; this is also the case with the new parishional espionage of Agent Johnny English, whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: re-loading.
Will a self-reliance image with a "evident that we're all shit" be a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, Johnny England’s stepfather with a reindeer got his right to chaos for the second time — his name is clearly referring to what he is a wide-screen comic book for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, a dumb secret agent who, despite his strange claims on the glamorous wedding, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's sketches and a piece of this guy, who gave one note to the Chariots of Fire song in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, once played in the memory of the television advertisement Barclaycard, in which the hero left behind a complete chaos.
In this latest edition, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English came near a helicopter dressed in middle - aged maturity, and the shovels were lying on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially because such “serious” cinemas as Agent 007 and “Mission Not Fulfilled” are now certainly offering comedy as an element.
It's such a sense that the mood is about children, not adults, and for me, the strange crimes of Johnny Inglesh are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the movies about Mr. Bine.
The permanent post is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, became an episodic.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a busted and tense figure who is already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the character of Quazi-Terezi-May, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers told her that since every active spy was compromised, she would have to resign.
And here on the stage is Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in a post office, but also gives informal lessons in secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, because English offers the skills of a rock-style spy academy.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency training and reunites with his former incompetent friend Buff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is in command of the submarine, the role of “weird hockey clubs”, in which Vicky Pepperdin is a bit lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are playing again because of the terrible mistakes that have been made in the secret service of Her Majesty, and they are faced with a beautiful rock woman by Ophelia Bullet in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the catcher Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of pharynx jokes: masked under the officers, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by transporting themselves on the luxury yacht of Walt; English produces a general anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality garniture to explore the interior of Walt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a nice and worthwhile invention, but there's something really childish about it.
Quite moderate things.
And, as with other Johnny Inglesh films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowen Atkinson the role of a truly proportionate talent?
Laborists deny that they are drawing up a plan to reduce the British working week to four days for five days' wages
The Laborist Party of Jeremy Corbin is about to consider a radical plan that says that the British will work four days a week but will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's managers to provide the rescue workers from the artificial intelligence revolution with additional output.
This would allow staff members to enjoy three-day leave for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea of “entering” into the economic agenda of the party would help the country's population to be on the side of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
The high-ranking Labour Party source said The Sunday Times: Policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the Party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this desire is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
The representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not regarded as a party”.
Black Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour Conference last week to concrete up his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to overthrow the authority of “indiscriminate directors” and “speculants” of municipal companies.
The design plans of the Chancellor also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour Government may make “debts” on the basis of alleged failures.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the Boards of Directors of Companies and to establish the Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms to work that could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” if the FBI investigation into Cavano can change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano held a final vote on his appointment as a judge at least a week and asked whether the Agency ' s findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavano.
In an interview shown on Sunday, the correspondent, "60 minutes" Scott Pelly, interviewed the senators of John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I'm going to the meeting, I said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after it happened, and I blew up this information, and I said, "Did you do this?"
His answer was firm, firm, and firm."
But Grem's opinion in the vote was still unmistakable.
“I am determined with regard to Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, according to action comparable to the dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I probably know is Brett strongly denied all this,” added Graham, addressing Christine Blaisey Ford.
“None of those whom she had called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
This story's been 36 years.
And I have not seen anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival (the Festival of Peace Citizens) will be the annual music event in which an impressive star with no less impressive mission will take place — the end of poverty worldwide.
Already in the seventh year of the Civilian Festival of Peace, as many as tens of thousands of people are meeting at the large staff of the Central Park, but not only to accommodate the performances of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to describe the present objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The festival of peace-citizens, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global project to combat poverty by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year-old Peace Citizens Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is it an idea to pay people a free visit to the concert to actually convince citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival, held by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is noted that this has resulted in a commitment by world leaders to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group sounded 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
According to the Panel, the funds allocated provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is the name The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementing professionals dedicated to “helping children to fully unlock their potential” promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county, which was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices about the lack of food in the past,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Panel also stated that after more than 5,000 actions had been undertaken to encourage Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of the Global Citizen answer: “This will be a long and difficult path that we will encounter and fall from time to time.
But as in major civil rights and apartheid struggles, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mone are some of the artists who will be taking part in this year's New York event, and will be the leaders of Deborah Lee Ferness and Heu Jackman.
United States dollars can be used by the military fleet for “blocks” to prevent exports of Russian energy: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “if necessary” resort to the assistance of its naval fleet to prevent Russian energy users from entering the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group, which has a position as “the voice of the energy user” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective in fuel use and replacement,” says the Minister, calling Russia “one-way pony”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trampa Administration had set the task of increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of the Tromp Administration, including the US President-in-Office, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” North Stream-2 pipeline project, which, according to Tramp, was made by Berlin as Moscow’s “slip”.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project at the cost of $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in September in Moscow.
The United States position called for a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industry in the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) called for the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes in our energy supply, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the possibility of a presidential ballot in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of a presidential ballot after the interim elections.
At the meeting of the city hall in Holioque, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the pre-election race.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and “start” our broken government, and this “up” requires a woman,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of a presidential round.”
Warren thus assessed the activities of President Donald Trump at the meeting: “The district is in the wrong direction”.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for the post of Chief Justice Brett Kavano.
On Friday, Warren wrote on Twitter: “We definitely need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters themselves did not think that it should be in conflict in 2020.
According to a survey of the University of Safolka/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, fifty-eight per cent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not get involved.
Thirty-two per cent of the respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known democratic names, which were discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective, include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byiden claims to take an official decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin told us about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trac Palin in a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump
The 26 - year - old Trek Paline, serving in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same suffering as other families who have the effects of the PTSR and who have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talse, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the eyebrows” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They are already returning to others, who have been beaten, asking questions, and whether the same respect is given to their companions, soldiers, airplanes and any other soldier they have given to their country.”
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence against a woman in the situation of violence and possession of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 States, the district of Colombia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of refugee or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts submitted an analytical note to the Court's counsellor on Friday on the support of the asylum seeker who challenged the policy in Washington.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions claim submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in the criminal group” have been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July the U.S. officials have denied her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers in favor of Grace said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala submitted a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on the provision of asylum has repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which has enabled immigrants without domestic violence to make a declaration of asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores the decades of application of public, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle”, says the Judicial Adviser.
Advocates also argue that the policy banning the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and that “provides the necessary workforce”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sachnes ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter for victims of domestic or gang violence.
“A refuge will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief”, Sessens said in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious ones people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
The situation became increasingly difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old mother, Riz Kusum, who comforts her sick little girl in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance will bring the wounded.
“Pure water is in great poverty.”
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes, dig in wetlands, and try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who had a fracture of the spine and shoulders, were resting near the Pala's army hospital, where patients were treated in open air because they had to leave the room because of the continuing strengths.
He is crying, remembering how a severe earthquake had destroyed the hotel number on the fifth floor that he had photographed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the cracks of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife yell, asked for help, and then quieted down.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope that they will be saved, and that they will be all right with me."
The US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out by “advertising advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in the daily American publication of the U.S. and China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the payment of the Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper edition of the state of Iowa, in an attempt to interfere with China's election to the United States Congress, which will take place on 6 November.
Tramp ' s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections was a confirmation of the fact that the U.S. officials had informed the Reuters agency: a new phase was under way in Washington ' s ever-increasing campaign to put pressure on China.
While foreign Governments are required to place advertising for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a position to scale up the trade war, thus balancing tariffs on imports from their countries.
China ' s tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Ayova, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, argues that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the resurrection magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this turf by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press. ”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Government of China takes advantage of our heart of the American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and placing advertising in the Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“At the same time in the newspapers here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear the inconspicuous voices and not see the true variety of opinions that the Chinese could learn about China’s disturbing economic policy, because local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most famous newspapers “slowly declined” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: The proportion of Kavano Republicans is reflecting female voters before the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain side by side and protect the candidacy of High Judge Brett Kavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and the analysts warn that a negative reaction is being observed, especially by women, who may affect the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the situation were heated to the extreme, and the majority of the Republicans formally stated that they wanted to continue voting.
You can’t go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Reer, a professor of politics at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Reier doubted that Senator Jeff Fleik (R-Arizona) ' s attempts to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget about it either tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierer, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors scandalized “November forward!” against the Senate, when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to apply for Kavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaci Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scope of the situation”, said a non-partisan politician Stu Rottenberg on the news website.
“People say that the situation has been so bad enough, and it is true.
But it can all get worse, especially with regard to female voters in awards and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the move, this step could cause a reaction.
“It’s already a problem for the Republican Party,” said Michael Styl, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about voting in committee or a final vote or whether Kavano is on the scale of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they deal with it,” said Gay Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have divided themselves into a few things about who to trust — Ford or Cavana — and to hear more about the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in Ford's statements exactly or most likely, while 35 per cent said they believe in Kavano exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano was at least or certainly lying at the time of his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to Fleika F.B.R., the charges brought by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, are currently being investigated, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford had sworn in to the Senate Legal Committee that he had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Judge showed her her genitals at a party at the Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Cup is planning to start a new web for Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Ley, the inventor of the World Cup, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who to provide access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lei, the Inrupt goal was to gain “world domination”.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his start-up.
“This is a historic moment”.
The annex uses Solid technology, which enables people to create their own “personal data store” or POD.
It may include contact lists, case lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – everything can be used in a single browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data”.
According to Director General John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to all.
Currently, the company is composed of Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several state-owned developers with whom a project contract is concluded, and the volunteer programmer community.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google on whether his company needed to make radical changes that would make all their business models completely different.
We do not ask their permission.
In his post on the Medium, published on Saturday, Bernards-Lei wrote that “Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network”.
In 1994, Berners-Lei converted the Internet, creating a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the voice of Berners-Lei has been quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Lei will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next Internet era,” says Berners-Le.
Bernard Vann: Church servant awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was rewarded with the cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was noted in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann was rewarded with this award on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellenglis and Leukuur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he never knew he had received the highest British military prize.
The memorial honoring this event was presented on Saturday by his two grandsons at the parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic”, that the monument was opened just 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Canten channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and ammunition”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire and with “greater courage” led the group forward and then with one hand threw a field gun, beating three soldiers in the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, to hear more than a month before the end of the war.
His 72-year-old grandson Michael Vann said that he “could hardly do the same heroicly, but it humbles him”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also awarded the award at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the virtue of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people”.
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they showed them the lead Peppo
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't let yourself see the main event.
São José had 13 battles, including six main program battles, which had been broadcast all night in the straight-air air on the 5 British television channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the patients in the United Kingdom were shocked to see on the screens "Peppa Lead".
Some patients were not impressed by this, for they did not sleep until morning just to see the battle.
One Twitter fan called this a change in the news on a child-multifilm “some sick joke”.
“It was a public decision that this content was inappropriate for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President Bellator for Marketing and Communications when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Peppa Pig."
Bellator Scott Koker said that they were planning to draw up a timetable so that in the future, visitors from Britain could also look at them.
“As for the re-show, I think we can solve this issue,” Koker says.
“But there is a Friday, six o’clock in the morning, and we cannot solve this issue until the Sunday of our time, and it will be Monday for them.
But we'll do our best.
Believe it or not, when the news was changed, a bunch of text messages fell asleep, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, and we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out no, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise you this will not happen the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a breakthrough.
Indeed, evil was the end of it."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced a feeling of inadequacy because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic driver Tom Dale says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that “not everything like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that the victory at the Olympics was getting less anxious after he had a child.
The permanent leader of the multi-year show Kirsty Yang took leave for several months because of his illness.
Daley, who played the lead guest in Lavern's program, said that he felt “more worthless than any of the monsters” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, “To this day, these feelings of worthlessness have come true, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was “meaning something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The double bronze Olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and, at his address at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality this year.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that feelings for the man, the American director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, had “been broken up”.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar Laureate, who was 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never a problem.
“If you’re so young,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find a peer who would have the same heartless life experience.
A couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daley said that “all his perception of the world” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says a sportsman.
“But you know, there are things and more important gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley told me that his father didn't want to make it through his death, and one of his last requests was the first round of London 2012 competition tickets.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there anymore, and you won’t be able to sit there in the first row,’ says Daley.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” says a sportsman.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — sneaking in before a crowd of fellow Olympics was no better,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and he still likes it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 a.m. English summer time.
Michelson, who's not in shape, spent this Saturday on the rock of Cube Ryder.
The American Phil Mikelson will establish a record on Sunday, played his 47th Cup of Ryder match, but he will have to tighten the form to avoid an unpleasant turn.
Michelson, who played in the biennale for the 12th time record, was sent to a four-ball and four-ball stage on Saturday by Captain Jim Furick.
Instead of being at the heart of the events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time great winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game in the field in order to correct what he was concerned about.
I've never had the most direct hit, even at the top of my career, a 48-year-old sportsman is not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National hard track, where a long rap is usually punishing for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Michelson will meet with the exact British Open Francis Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who joined New Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who have lost four points in the 12th single match make a good start, the Mikelson match can be a decisive one.
Feric expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say.
“He fully understood the role he was playing today, grabbed me on his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Feric.
"He's pretty sure of himself.
He's a walking Hall of Praise, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and so we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Michaelson will win the Nike Faldo score for the number of players in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in Kubka Ryder, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven none, although Feric said his presence had little benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to be like people, and he’s a great guy who’s interesting with him,” he explained.
“I think that this week the young players were having fun with him, and it was interesting to see that.
His game is much more than just playing.”
Captain of the European team Thomas Byrne knows that a great advantage can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that significant leadership in the single level in Cuba Ryder can easily turn into an unfavorable side.
The Dutchman won the match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team, led by Northern Ballesteros, had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but overcame the final line just to hear the least difference, won with a 141⁄2-131.2 account.
“You continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only so far,” said Bjorn, who was sealed in the photo, after the 2018 Class, won in the Le Golf National field with an account of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in an account of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be out in full.
Go and do everything right.
Until the eyes are on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and it's a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said not to be silent, focusing on the 12 games of our team, but we know so well that what we are facing is against the great games of the world.”
Bjorn was happy that his players had spoken on a golf course that was uncomfortable for them. He added: “I would never have overpowered myself in this.
We'll have another test tomorrow.
Individual speeches begin tomorrow, and that is quite another matter.
Always nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you experience all your strength as a professional golfer.
That is exactly what it takes for the players to be fully exposed to tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Feric, believes that his individual games would be better than his partners, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Feric himself has spent all of this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe had the "Medine Miracle".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said, in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 had merged his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important players tomorrow, but you would like to finish it faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have made our plan for the game and we have set up the boys as we thought was right, do you understand? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McKilro in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen such a group of guys, and so on, because I think they will overcome all possible shortcomings in this way,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The introduction of a new military ship in Germany has again been postponed
The German fleet's newest fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen at least in the following year due to poor systems and low-cost growth, local media reported.
The entry into operation of the Rhineland-Phalz, the main ship is completely new to the Baden-Württemberg class, now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, referring to the military representative.
The vessel had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the military fleet in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of zenite and anti-coal missiles, as well as some “stels” technologies, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying new frescoes for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to distribute its power abroad, are already ageing by the time they enter into arms, notes Die Zeit.
Bad F125 F125 caught news headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused entry into operation of the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss at Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipowner after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and equipment defects” that made the warship useless in combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, since the Baden-Württemberg court would operate with a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the working force on the old Bremen.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy, reducing its productivity and limiting the ability of the IMF to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate twice as heavy a similar class of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to incorrect equipment, the cost of the whole project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the initial €2.2 billion.
The problem of the detention of the newest refrigerants has become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the reduction of the military-marriage power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the military forces had actually “saved ships capable of deployment”.
The officer said that the problem had increased over time because the old ships had been removed from service, but their ships had not been replaced.
He visited that none of Baden-Württemberg's frigates could have been armed with a fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouse
A new study carried out in one of the premises of Scotland’s Nagoya has the task of showing how mice use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received will be able to re-examine the behaviour of unique winged mammals and assist in further conservation activities.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland, will study conventional bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-haired mice and Dobanton nightbirds inhabited by Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registries will be established at some points around the site to track the action of flying mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Deuar, NTS conservation adviser, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of housing management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways of maintaining forest masses, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The population of flying mice in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are at risk of disappearing because of construction and development that affect their habitat and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may pose a risk, as well as a fly clamp, chemical processing of construction materials and hunting of household baskets.
Actually, flying mice aren't blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits are more useful to their ears than the eye when it comes to harvesting.
They use complex echo-location techniques to precisely identify obstacles to the flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten trained experts regularly carry out interviews, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of flying mice in Scotland at Thrave in Damfris and Galloue, where eight of the ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the property is ideal for them.
“Here, in Thrave, is a great place for flying mice,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good housing environment.
But many of the flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need in order to survive.”
It recalls the importance of checking the presence of flying mice before carrying out technical services within private jurisdiction, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could result in the loss of 400 females and young persons, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by the law, their destruction, drought or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish mouse conservation officer, calls on the public to help.
She said, “We have to know much about our flying mice, and we do not know how many of them live.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape and his lawyers are going to trial the German magazine
Cristian Ronald denies the charges against him of rape, calling them “faecal news”, and claiming that people simply “want to own” using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial the German newsmagazine Spigel, who has issued an indictment against a football player.
Forward Portugal and Juventus were accused of rape by an American named Catherine Majorg, who allegedly took place in the hotel room of Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported it to Spigel on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram, where a football player had 142 million subscribers, several hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, called this information “faecal news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is all fake news, says five-time winner Ballon d'Or on camera.
“They just want to pry using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, my name is spoken, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I'm fine," adds a sportsman with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are ready to file charges against Spigel, which they have called “unauthorized confidentiality suspect information”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the game is intended to seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the hotel number Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Upon meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorg allegedly returned to the playroom, where he allegedly raped her in an analytic form, according to the documents submitted to the Clarke District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent of the good guy, but he was down one per cent”.
The documents claim that Ronald confirmed that the couple had been engaged in sex, but that was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and that images of her trauma were taken in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear of revenge” and feared “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the painful feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a transaction of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain “deplores Autoproducers Who Are Lost Forever”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise Greg Clark said that Britain would “suffer at all times” if Brexit lost its world-leading car production status after that.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaton plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese auto-producer stated that the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to job losses.
The factory in Bern is produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” says Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed fears about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims to shut down the Mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to Autoproducers, if Brexit does not have a supply chain transaction, there will be a high risk.
The Toyota production line is run “in time”, and the vehicle details are supplied to UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a transaction, there may be a failure on the border which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and delays.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep stocks at its factory in Derbishir for more than one day and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Theresa May Plan, which was announced in the Checkers, on future relations with the EU “was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks”.
“We need a deal,” he said, “we want to make a better deal, which will allow me to not only succeed at this moment, but also take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said in the era of BBC Radio 4 “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time limit for which production would be suspended, but in the longer term it had warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually reduce jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Bern for 24 years and is the head of the trade union, says that the concern of members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to White House information
The responsible meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be “transmitted to another week”, as the fight for Brett Kavano's candidacy continues as a Supreme Judge, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein advocates the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia ' s involvement in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia ' s assistants and the potential obstacles to the President ' s justice.
Whether Trump would resign the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering the independence of Mueller, has caused a mass of suspicions in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record talks with Trump and the President ' s implicability through amendment 25.
Rosenstein rejects this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not " prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Judicial Committee, on which Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Kristin Blaci Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a weekly investigation into the FBI's complaints in Kavano, which further held a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, made a speech on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, or perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press in mind."
Some journalists argue that Sanders did not hold briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace was wondering why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not a “demeanor to the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny what they are playing at the public”.
It proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President is holding more meetings by answering journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without adding the exact figures, “We have these figures.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me”.
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it is a worthy exchange of press briefings.”
The Trump regularly answers questions from the White House by participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking individuals.
The conference is a rare thing for the press alone.
Voluntary and sometimes strange behavior of the President before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why.
Minister of Health addressed EU staff in Scotland with a letter on the concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has asked EU staff working in the Scottish SGEI to express their gratitude for the rental of the whole country and to wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to staff members less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making statements of status for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and this fall should be decided on.
However, the British Government is also strengthening the preparation for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and outside the EU will gain valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombi had an emergency surgery with regard to head injury
Michael The Tennessee Authority reported that the tennis State Tigers semi-protection officer Christian Abercromby had an emergency operation after having received a head trauma on Saturday after defeating 31-27 in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma had been received shortly before the break.
“He went to the side line and just moved there,” said Reid.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before putting it on the carrier and taking it to medical examination.
The official representative of the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no details of the type/degree of injury”, and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombi, only on the second course, this was the first season of the Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully caught five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will receive a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom and additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This step leads to no results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
An increased harvest will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May will announce today.
This step has led to no attempt by Corbin to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase citizens ' income.
The increase in the harvest will be made by individuals and companies not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus provided should encourage the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The supplement to the existing herb collection, including the increase introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary and rental housing, may amount to up to three per cent.
The penitentiary expects that this step will allow up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London property is purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for buyers who purchase their first apartment to improve their housing conditions later.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “major cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the backbone to help a greater number of young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of undermining real estate prices, acquiring land, but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to give up the available housing quota in order to correct the “poor housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include the control of rent and the cessation of unwarranted eviction.
It also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my prime minister to the fulfillment of the British dream — to make life better with every new generation.
This includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that people who are not citizens of the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, have access to real estate as do workers.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own house has become too far away, and the danger for some to be found on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
The boss of the Sunderland Club Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased with the reinvigoration of the North-East Club, which currently takes the third place in the first league, separated from the top three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the B hat, and everything," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching with my father in Scotland in Hampden as a child, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will only happen if I can be a successful club manager.”
Rossa's predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardys, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gas Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said he did not experience a trepeat before such authoritative names in such major clubs, earlier refusing to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," says the coach.
“Bringing him out is an easy task, but I will assume that he has done his job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years, first becoming an assistant manager in Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hearts training station.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and in the next season he took St Mirren out of the lower positions of the winner of the championship.
Ross claims that today he feels more comfortable than ever during his gaming career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably the present crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the management suits me more than playing.
That sounds strange because I did all right, made good on this position, and made some progress.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good at being in charge.
I always wanted to lead, and now, doing this, I feel more comfortable like a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life.”

According to the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for beer pints
The summer heat has increased the sales of British pubs, but has reduced the sales of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July and fell by 4.8 per cent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, which received this statistics, says: “Sustainable solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when cotton sales grew by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly.”
The fall in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results compared in restaurants.
Babies who only sell food also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out of the street just to miss the bottle.
Drink sales in strawberries and bars grew by 6.6% per month and food by 3%”.
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the field of long-term and hotel business, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting activities remain key factors when it comes to sales on the non-resident market.
Surprisingly, restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, more so that sales drop by 4.8 per cent in annual calculation will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressure.
It has been a long hot summer as never before for food operators, and it is not yet the fact that more moderate temperatures will take place in August.
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the burning of fires.
Sectoral sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the productivity of 47 networks with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from his parents
According to the survey, every fifth child — some of whom are 11 years old — has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a growing number of faecal instincts
This news has exacerbated concerns about the sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they have a “main” account that parents know about
However, each fifth child, some of whom are 11 years of age, creates social accounts that he hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in the number of faecal “insta” accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photo exchange site.
This news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a basic, clean account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother who accidentally got access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account came up with a teenager who called on others to “enforce him”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles in social networks, half of which were recognized as usually secret.
HMC Chapter Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a worrying fact”.
Elid Doyle will become a "voice of athletes" of Scotland's light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of the Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most well-known sportsman on light athletics. President Yen Bitti claims that this step is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of extensive international experience in sport for the past decade.
“Eylide enjoys enormous respect in the Scottish, British and world light athletic community, and we are confident that it will benefit greatly from its participation in the light athletics in Scotland,” says Beatty.
Doyle says: “I strive to be a voice of athletes, and I hope that I can make a real contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
A U.S. player who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlante Games has a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now serving as a series of BBC commentators, has lost his ability to walk after the stroke.
He writes on his Twitter: "A month ago, I had an stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it would only take time to see if I could fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I practice hunting!
Thank you very much for your support."
The advertising of milk oats, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of internet users
The dairy companies have created online disputes, publishing an ad comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
By placing on the market, they say, “the world’s first silent breast milking agent,” Elvie published an advertising music video showing the freedom that a new milking agent gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full haystack under a musical track, where they say, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a change, it's my breast."
And the cows say: We will go on and on and on and on and on and on and on for our young; and on and on and on and on.
This advertising role, which was published on the Facebook page, caused disputes on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received a unique response from the viewers, many saying it sheds light on the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children take them away for a few days after birth, ” writes one user.
Elvie’s milky sauce is dressed directly under a special butcher (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is believed that it is as traumatic as it is for mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk cheese for mothers who leave their children?"
Another user adds: “Advert out of reality.”
Others, on the other hand, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great”.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed the kid, I'd have to buy one.
Breast feeding actually made me feel cowlike.
The advertisement is, of course, a little shocked, but that's what it feels like.
The product’,” wrote one user.
And another comment: "The most popular ad for mothers who breast-feed (usually do it directly at their jobs or in toilets) and who, in truth, feel little "cows."
This advertising is not for us to admire or abuse our milk industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women showed that they were all dancing with these unmarked milk sauces hidden under the bustgalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel cows.
In fact, Elvie’s lactose is completely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the breast-gall for feeding, and it is not noticeable that women are able to move, hold the baby and even walk out the street during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and expert on early development of Mother’s children, comments: “Elvie’s lactose is such a revolutionary product that it deserves courageous and provocative advertising.
By drawing a parallel between women and cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, demonstrating in a fun and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that gives a new milk sauce.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk tank gets in the headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Martha Jacobovski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have safely moved to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tramp administration have made it difficult for the children to be placed in command.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking charge of the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential contractors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified at Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been requested to take care of minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
“Approximately 80 per cent of the persons who are either contractors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them are foreigners who commit a crime.
That is why we continue to pursue these people," said Albens.
In the words of the housekeepers, in order to speed up the process of child training, officials introduced new rules that some of them had to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not 60 days earlier.
In order to declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not on their own.
Those deemed to have no right to help will be quickly deported.
According to shelter and information workers in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be concerned or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Advocates say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are fighting.
Syria orders the U.S., France and Turkey to immediately withdraw the army
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualam, also called upon Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had already taken place in the country for the eighth year.
Mualam, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian land, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the assembled.
Mualam insists that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “loved illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has over 1,000 military personnel in the war country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been set up for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “dissemination of irrational insurance” which encouraged refugees to stay abroad.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement to end the war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large area of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including those from the Al-Qaeda-related front of Nusra, who would be “destroyed”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee will soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualam outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “the consideration of articles of the current Constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins the second deadline
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the implicity and scandal do not end in advance, and that is what many Liberals hope for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the very dramatic finale of the Presidency for all history!”
At this point, there are no signs of wear and tear.
Since 2014, premium-time ratings have grown by more than twice — up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times — up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million viewers on screens at night during the show of major news.
“It is a fire to which people are drawn, because it is beyond our understanding,” says Neil Bear, director of the ABC “Deputy survivor” drama, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the Capital was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skowell, a long-standing comedy writer and author, “Just funny: a few unpleasant truths about entering the Hollywood Boys’ Club” offers another theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston once before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is ridiculous.”
There is something valuable in all this chaos — it is fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington's news lines can determine the future of Row vs. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is the brightest that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you're six o'clock in the morning, you're looking at how the group of experts is discussing Bob Woodward's use of the "deep background" for his book "Strah," or about Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from the strausin of the skin (clothes warmed with pride," says Washington Post), or about the harsh description of Stormy Daniels, so to speak, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it's already out of the ordinary awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Partly his job is to make us feel that the reality show is to feed you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing actor composition of the Trump show and the daily twists of the plot (draka with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Yn).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're hopelessly left.
When I contacted Mr. Fles this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC at the time of the CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, at least not exactly when they showed Brett Kavano to the Legal Committee of the Senate and decided on the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of Western civilization,’” says Mr. Fles.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money is involved in the worst interim elections leading to the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is receiving cash flow through a change in the districts of Congress, in which two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This beautiful Pittsburgh area, whose geography has not been changed for a long time, supports a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb protests against another current official, the Republican of Kitt Rotfus, who is currently representing the 12th old district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly in conflict with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas had been assigned to Republicans in violation of the Constitution as a result of pre-election machinations.
In the new 17th district, a heated debate was held on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Congress of the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republical Campaign (NRCC).
Lamba's name became known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the democrats little advantage.
United States of America ordered El Salvador to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to Washington ' s negative response.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varello, who was also in Panama until the partners had evicted the management team from Trump.
Representatives of the host department decided to withdraw the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions on non-recognition of Taiwan”, stated earlier this month the Secretary-General of the Heser Neuert Department.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed criminal sanctions, including reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
In the background of the regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America had postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have been held to facilitate the outcome of a similar meeting held last year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue its preparations, and had actually discontinued the consideration of El Salvador ' s punishment.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens in the sign that the administration attaches real importance to the meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives have successfully returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been reported by three American officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirmed a side-by-side analysis of the terms of the administration, but also spoke in terms of anonymity.
Study the History
The next step could be a statement by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possibility of impeding Mr. Trump to justice, as there is currently very substantial evidence in the public records.
Mr. Muller also reportedly began investigating the facts of Trump's campaign with Russia and its attacks during the elections.
If Congress changes the landlord, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he is prepared to speak again to the voters, and perhaps finally to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many ‘ifs’; I do not want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, as is his fall in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakian army in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed in the years to come.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the immeasurable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are experiencing some of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper's information, last year he proposed to make secret records of the President's activities and discussed his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times data is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavano is not complete or true, or if it is still approved as a Supreme Judge despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the medium term for Congress, which will bring Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will prove too long for democracy.
But I believe we can have them through the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, co-founded in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied the palace, in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she led me to light Saturday candles at the table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past as I can't be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book The Last Court: A Troubled Age of Europe in the History of Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Grem Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the encounter with the Venice Rapid football club.
The Rangers take the Venice Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after noticing anything in Spain over the Villareal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented Brem Dorrans from speaking for the first time before the 2:2 season against the Villareala, but he believed that Rangers could use this result as a trampline to achieve great results.
"That was a good time for us because "Vilarreal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and get out of here.
Maybe, at the end of the day, we could do it, but in general, nothing was probably a fair result.
They probably played better at the first time, and our success came at the second time, where we proved ourselves better.
There will be another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but this is going to be a complicated game, because they have shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the patients, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, taking into account all my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor.
The composition is wonderfully improved, and the boys really get the pleasure; the workouts have gone to the ura.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pension accumulations
Although the survey participants had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it to their family members.
About half of those participating in the national survey said that they had discussed with their wives the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10 per cent said they spoke on the subject with their children.
“People want to care about them, but they’re not trying to discuss this topic with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide for Life Insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your wives and children: you cannot prepare your family for what they may need to care for you if you do not give ear to your wishes.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial adviser for advice: he will help you develop a payment plan.
Your choice of long-term care funding can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided you have money.
Put your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in health care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that your wishes are met if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend consideration of the possibility of financial confidentiality.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor your accounts if you prove unable.
Don’t forget the little ones: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he was on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on what medicines he is taking and on what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on the paper so that they can be prepared in any case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have money but also to choose a doctor.”
"What are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Make a plan and write it down.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several times from a pneumatic rifle
A man shot a few times out of a pneumatic windshield coming home from a stroller.
The victim, in his chest, his life, and his hand were shot, for 40 years, in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 a.m. in English summer time, as “accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are safe for life, the police are now looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As a result of the construction of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donggal, a region north of Pala, which is close to the earthquake epicenter with 7.5 balls.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pala as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongal located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (given for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis occurred.
Dongala is a district that is 300 km long (180 miles) north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, the administrative area of the less province, had 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and in particular of the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel production is also important for the province ' s economy, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Reduction Agency, tsunamis have occurred several times in Pala and Dongal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggal in 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and is regularly suffering from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.

Sarah Palin's older son was arrested for domestic violence.
Trac Palin, the son of former Governor Alaska and Vice-Canadian of President Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Paline from Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interfering with the situation of domestic violence and for resisting the arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su's insulator and will be released in a bet of $500.
He appeared in the courthouse on Saturday, and when they asked him if he was guilty, he declared his “unprecedented innocence”.
The use of three small A-criminals threatens Paeline, which means that he may be deprived of his liberty for up to one year and punished for $250,000.
He was also charged with the crime of Class B, which was punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
That's not the first time Peylin was charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, fraud in the report of domestic violence and the storage of arms in the state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after explaining her son ' s ill-treatment with post-traumatic stress disorder, allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.

The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York
The New York Federal Prosecutor ' s Office is seeking a death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly took the Home Depot truck to attack the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and bikers.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo “intendedly” killed eight people and “intendedly” caused serious bodily harm, according to a statement of intention to achieve the death penalty imposed in the South York County.
According to the judicial document, a death sentence may be imposed on both charges.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saip with 22 counts of charges, which included eight charges of murder for rockets used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “intelligently planned and intentional”, Saipov implemented it as described as “disgusting, cruel and criminal”.
“Syfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini’s family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Anna Laura Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendosa’s and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko’s intentions,” says the statement of intentions.
Five were killed by tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since a death penalty was imposed by the prosecutor in the South District of New York for a crime.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug dealers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
For the last time, the death penalty for the federal case in New York was imposed in 1953 against Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death in order to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was punished with an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov, the birthplace of Uzbekistan has demonstrated a lack of discretion following their attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by an IGIL video on the phone to attack him.
He also requested that the IGIL flag be suspended in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denies his guilt for all 22 convictions.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipova's side, said they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence had previously appealed to prosecutors not to obtain a death sentence.
A member of the parliament from Tori said that NAIJEL FARAZ should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people’s army”.
Former Ukip leader said that policies should “sympathize” the Eurosceptics, as one member of the Parliament of Teresa May assumed that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said at a meeting in Birmingham that Britain would have “extended” if Mr. Faraz were Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May, in trying to reconcile her deep-separated ranks, is further exacerbated by the fact that members of the Tori party against EU membership join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The prime minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan in the Chekers in the wake of the attacks by Brexit, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that it continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite a negative reaction and thus force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and its chaos.
Mr. Bown said at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihall, which he wanted to play the Checkers.
He proposed that Mr. Faraz should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he were responsible, we would have gone out.”
Member Wellingboro added, "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Checkers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in the wars of the world to be dependent.
We want to lay down our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain completely out of line”.
Brexit of the Tori Andrea Jenkins party was also at a meeting, giving journalists this comment: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Chekers are unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among the members of our party and our activists, who actually push the streets and choose us first.
Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what they're saying."
In her strong appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers will remain in their work if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to be handed over to the 2016 referendum, they would have to be “sensitized”.
“It is now a matter of trust between us and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you down."
Turning to the warned crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel neglected.
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country, which is giving us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit’s opponents took part in a demonstration on Birmingham, followed by a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists were waving the Tori v. Brexit posters in these outlets.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Laborist Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for their security problems in their mobile annex.
“And these people claim that they can set up IT systems and technology Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a one-sided page.
Brexit does not exist in principle," he says.
Warren plans to “determine” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the U.S. Parliament, said that after the November elections she would “seek to explore the possibilities of balling in the presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat reported on Saturday about her future at a rattush meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, was in November to re-election against a member of the Republican party Jeff Dila, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Talks are taking place that she has the chance to take the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the voters in Holioca; since Trump joined the post, it was already her 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a Ratusha meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to go to the president's office.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to “start” our broken government, and for it to be a woman.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (gunshot), the LSU player was arrested
Baton-Ruzh police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shoot) of the LSU basketball player Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11:00 an English time at a press conference, Baton-Ruz announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify the person who was shot.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot around the campus of South University on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms received a gunshot wound to his head, which ended,” said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, to the journalists on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to participating in the incident, carrying weapons and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist the arrest and was arrested in the East Baton-Ruz district police station.
The young man grew by 1 m 82 cm in Baton-Ruzh, played 32 games with 10 starters last season and picked up on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 games.
Gran Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Bottas was qualified on Saturday, Louis Hamilton was convinced that Mercedes's team tactics played a major role in the race.
With the semi-poster Bottas, he was well-initiated and practically up on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton hanging in the tail of the whole group, a choice that became a decisive one.
Mersedes went to the pit stop one round later, and then he went behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some fight of the wheeled wheel, broke out, which led to the involuntary release of the Ferrari driver, risking a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of a series of networks and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
Then he drove most of the race, holding on to his tires, in order to finish fast, and he pushed Kim Rykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went on foot at the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds, as Rykkonen took fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the outputs and had shown this generosity by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in the stock," Hamilton said.
Handicraft language
President Donald Trump criticised Senator Diane Finstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for claiming that she had not published a letter by Christina Blaci Ford, accused of Brett Kavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that the participants of these events were “skinned, angry and lying people”.
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is wonderful, it is anger, anger, bitterness and lies,” he said.
'You see all this running away,' they will say, 'No, I did it not.
I didn't do that.”
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you "sweet" the information?
Remember her answer... did you "smash" the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't melt.
Yeah, stop.
We didn't, did we, did we, did we?...No, we didn't, did we, didn't we, did he add to the senator's intonation.
In July, a letter detailing the charges brought by Ford v. Kavano was sent to Finland, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Finland denied that the leak had occurred in its office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t share her information,” Finnstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of the escape seems to be unpopular to the president, who commented at the Saturday meeting: "This is what I tell you: the language of the body has misled her.
Maybe she wasn't "smelling," but the language of the body was worse than I've ever seen."
While continuing to protect his candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President assumed that the democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They certainly try to regain power in all the available ways.
We see humility, ill will, no matter who they hurt, through whom they must strive to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: "Dandi Star" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for "Jiants" in the game against "Dandi"

Jiantes was given an early advantage in two goals thanks to the beatings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the Jiants to the leader.
François Bushar compared Dandi's account before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen strengthened their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif who won over Dandi, account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday evening, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
Among the parties was the fourth meeting in the season when the Jiantes won the previous three matches.

The air traffic controller killed hundreds of people aboard the plane to avoid earthquakes
The Indonesian air inspector was sentenced to death by a hero after he deliberately went to death to be able to fly hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to destroy the area, many of the city’s inhabitants have fallen under the cracks of buildings.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the terrifying airfield of Mutiaar Sis Al Jufre Airport, Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the landing course, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he was shown that the height was going down, he slammed it.
Later he ended up in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesia's air navigation agency, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take it to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher ended before the helicopter was able to sit in Pala.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of people killed as a result of the earthquake may reach thousands because, according to information provided by the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to grow, as a large number of people are still under the ravages, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The volunteers, whose height was six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, says Sky News: “A quick help will bring victims every minute.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets have been robbed all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know they will stay there.
Tragedy has already taken place on a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
The President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, arrived at Pala on Sunday and spoke before the country's armed forces, in particular, said: "I ask all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lomboca, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian Aviation Disaster: Air Niugini now reports that one person has disappeared without news after crashing a plane into the lagoon
The airline flying a plane that had suffered a break in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports that one person had disappeared without news, while it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had successfully left the plane.
The Air Niugini report states that as a Saturday, it does not have any information about one male passenger.
The airline reported that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped save other passengers and aircraft crew after he landed on the water trying to land at the Chuuk airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. VMS claim that the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing zone.
Some witnesses claim that the plane could not land on the landing strip.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane is getting on the ground too low.
“And that’s very good, ” Janes adds.
Janes told me that he and other passengers had been able to get to the emergency exits on a towing plane because the water level was on the belt.
He also told me that the stewardess panicked and shouted on board, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the mariners who repaired the vicinity also helped to rescue by using an inhaled boat on which they transported people to the shore before the plane landed at about 30 metres (100 ft).
The flight security networks show that, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in aircraft accidents involving companies registered in PNG, but none of these accidents have been related to Air Niugini.
Analyst on the subject was able to prove that women were burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution brought an action against a man charged with burning the population of Mississippi in 2014.
The analysis by the Department of Justice of the United States, Paul Roulett, provided long-term evidence as an expert on the analysis of the findings.
He told the department how he used cell phone records to draw up a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette told us that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, that evening Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his cell phone was near Chambers; when this was discovered, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, the phone records indicate that they only called for one week.
Roulette also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, she had removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He killed her out of her life,” says Hale.
Protection should begin by setting out its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is the "conscious hip-hop"?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight negatively against this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that the hip hop content has changed from the original political and social problems.
The group wanted to go back to its roots and make the “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in Britain through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York City Miss filed a trial for a family couple due to racist text messages
The New Yorker filed a complaint to a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a communication from a woman that she had become “one more black”, which a woman mistakenly sent to her husband.
The wives deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “for extortion”.
Linci Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nurse, proposed by the childcare service, Gizel Morris, was black when she came into the family for her first working day in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEEET, so NOT THAT THERE IS ONE DIFFERENT, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a text to her husband.
Instead of texting her husband, however, she twice misdirected his Miss Morris.
Realizing its complexity, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in service that the girl who had become an African American had done a bad job and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African American, reported New York Post.
Morris paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now in court for a family couple and is demanding compensation for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, have not been entered into by any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are not allowed,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know this is discrimination.”
The wives disagree with the charge of racism, and they say that Maurice’s dismissal can be considered a reasonable step because if she was attacked, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she really didn’t mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joe Plasco, a postman.
“But would you trust your children to whom you were rude, even if they were rude?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, let's go.
Calling the claim “emergence”, Plasco said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation”.
“Are you ready to pursue the man who has been in this state?
Not very nice of you," added a bank worker who specializes in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but the public opinion has already pronounced its sentence on social networks, accusing couples of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not walk with a talking bear, says the new letter
Bonda’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, responded: “It’s hard to put herself in place for those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know that Paddington is very successful.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would refer to refusing to publish with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his book was “and joyful and bitter” because last year their author had not become.
As for Paddington, she referred to him as “a very important member of our family”, and that her father was quietly proud that his character had finally become known.
“He was quiet and modest,” his daughter said.
“Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear himself.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane was landed, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 where doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said it was really bad, something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold on to my arms."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Ednan Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, calming down the huge loss she had just had to survive.
“ Nobody knew what had happened around, ” she says.
“My head is broken, I have not stopped crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I tried this all-encompassing feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survive the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphrey are setting up openings on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and at the age of 18, he ended up with him.
“I don’t want other parents to experience the same things I experience every day, ” she says.
Forty-five-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, tells me her son was a great shot and had a damn promising smile.
"They all loved his smile.
They said, "When he's smiling, he's in the room as if he's on fire."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was worried about the present terrible times.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who had ended up with him, found his own brother, who was 11 years old at the time.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm not afraid that a chain reaction will occur."
Mrs. Davis has come up with these openings, "so that people knew that there was someone they could talk to and tell everything, even if it was your friend.
It is not for you to sit down and remain silent, but it is for you to speak to the people."
Mrs. Hamphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she had lived for 15 years — not soon after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset, or something like that,” she says.
“In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
It was a very bad thing for him; he did not look at his children when they opened their breasts.
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, and this event has shocked our family.
She broke it into pieces.
But we must live and fight."

Future Brett Kavano hanging on the wall: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked — a time- and volume-limited investigation, we could bring a little unity at least,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was “disrupting” on the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, everything goes wrong for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the highest judge of the country.
George W. Bush will call the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavano, who has been working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
To date, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pensu to resolve the issue of equality of vote and confirm his candidacy for the post of Chief Justice.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yn came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Boone Seug, referring to the data from the Ministry of the South, said that, compared to the 2,706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, the figure had decreased to 1,127 cases last year.
Mr. Pack said that the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China and the higher rates taken by smugglers who exported people had become key factors.
No public comment is given.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people are fleeing through China, with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the probably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often subject to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, still in war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjana to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yn in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yun Ho, accused the United States of impeding progress with their sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Kavano “historic”, and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavano, a candidate for the senior judge, “historic” and said that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called “historic”,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kavano in the Senate Legal Committee, given to them on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally rejected the accusations of Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford in sexual harassment, which may have occurred when they were both teenagers.
Kawano spoke emotionally, sometimes even screaming and breathing, telling about his family and school years.
He also strongly condemned the Committee's democrats, calling charges against him “grotesque and clearly planned murder of the active person”, organized by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi also said that, according to her testimony, Kavano had only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was prejudicial to the democrats.
“I think he’s disqualificating himself with his claims, as well as with the way he deals with Clinton and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked whether she would try to get Kavano to blame if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only fit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is now”, Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavano regarding the Available Medical Services Act or the Rou v. Wade, as he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavano raised the question of whether he would have to revoke some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
“Now is not the time to put an aesthetic and preconceived man to the post of Supreme Judge and to shout, ‘How great!’” says Pelosi.
And women must own it.
It's just anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," Miss Stein told me 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think it is?"
She continued: “The woman who worked for me in a position of leadership was very helpful, and she told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her interviewer: “You can think that I’m crying because I’m upset.
I'm really upset."
And then she just kept talking.
I was deeply impressed by this approach.”
Tears are permitted as a way out of anger in part because they are treated in the root incorrectly.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men dominated: once I cried out for anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a heartless manager, who I was always afraid of, and dragged into a stroller.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
They do not know that you are weeping for evil.
They think that you are upset, and they are rejoicing that they have brought you the truth."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in some trivial plot and left the race, and Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to interfere with the President's position.
“It wasn’t meant to be,” she admitted with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Beloshnegka and seven gnoms".
The campaign had already come to an end, had left much money behind, and had therefore sworn that it would not be in the race unless it had raised $2 million.
It was said that this was a completely defeatable option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I’m a precious commodity for them,” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so touched by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as by the anger of discrimination on a sexual basis that she breathed.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
“You might think that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my memory?
"She's been crying without end?"
How the war on trade with the United States can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first outbreaks of trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle was still far from over, the gap between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar, steel and aluminium batteries.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion) and actually taxed half of all goods from the United States of China.
Beijing had been hit by an equal number of responses, with a recent imposition of US goods duties of $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that the response to the United States would be equal every time, and the world ' s second-largest economy could hardly begin to experience at least the smallest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to resign, but to publicly resign the United States would be too humiliating for China's President, China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic downturn in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than those previously recognized by observers,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist at the Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” to return refugees
Syria states that it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualem, reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of counter-terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All conditions have now been created for voluntary return of refugees to a country they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the assistance of the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe consolidates the victory of Kubke Ryder in Paris
The European team won the Cup of Ryder 2018, winning the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the Paris, France.
The US$ has been lost six times in European land and the European Cup of Ryder has not won since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown thanks to the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, who took 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water at the 16th match pair-3, joined his match Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds, became 1-x-4 players that ever went 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a defeat of 5:4 with the lowest ranking in the European team, Turbyor Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, has joined 2:1 Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in Cube Ryder for the last time.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Kubkov Ryder, has become the winner of a tournament throughout Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all on the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing over a torch to his roommate, John Rem, who won a victory on Sunday over the American golf legend by Tiger Woods with an account 2:1 in a single game.
“I am extremely proud of this victory – I grew up watching Tiger Woods’ game,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 main titles, only taking Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly was fighting all the way out, trying hard to make it, but the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were showing the high-class golf course throughout the tournament.
After his tireless speech, U.S. captain Jim Furick said: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to climb Europe easily.
It didn't work.
We're taking the traps in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with PGA America and with our Committee of Cube Ryder, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red Flow: News Microorganisms concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The latest report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reflects a general reduction in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Tampa Gulf.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Koller there is a report of abundant coloring, which says that micro-organism concentrations are reduced.
The Red River extends approximately 130 miles of the coastline from the North Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The gorges can be observed about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsboro, but their number has declined significantly compared to last week.
The Red River is also observed in the region of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration in and near Pinellas district, from low to high concentration in the coastal zone of Hillsboro, high concentration in Manati and Sarasota districts and coastal zones, medium concentration in Charlotte district, high concentration on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in Koller districts were reported.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Koller, there is still a likelihood of respiratory irritation.
No such likelihood was reported in North West Florida last week.
