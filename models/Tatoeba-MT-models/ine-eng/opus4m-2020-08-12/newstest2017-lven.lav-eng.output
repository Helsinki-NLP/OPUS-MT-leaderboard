28-year-old meal found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week , a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a supermarket.
But the brother of the sacrifice says that he cannot imagine anyone who wants to do something against his brother, saying, "His life has finally begun to improve."
The asset found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Medical Bureau of the Court of Justice.
San Francisco police reported that his death was recognized as a murder and is now under investigation.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells the Sanfrancisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a baker in Boston, but six months ago he went to his dream restaurant "Sons & Daughters" Sanfrancisco.
The representative of the "Sons & Daughters" restaurant informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we think of ourselves as friends and family with Frank.
Luis Galicia says that Frank was at the beginning of the night in the hostel, but lately life has finally improved.
"He went into a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who he would like to do for his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family, preparing delicious meals and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in the fight.
He was the brother who adapted to others.
"In view of everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond, which soon froze every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: Calling for New Protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to start protests on the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Committee of the New Doctors (JAK) is preparing to request advice to support more protests in early September.
JAK considers that the ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
Against the contract, 58% of all the members who took part in the vote voted.
In a Thursday evening post on Twitter, JAK Council member Elena McCorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of a contract has been rejected.
She said: "As a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the closure of the government, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA councils to authorize the development of new contracts that would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, new doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
Following the vote against the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA recommended by the BMA, LMA’s new physician’s representative, Dr. Johans Malavana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunts, informed that the contract would be concluded with the British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Space Alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and announce the end of the war of eight months of word and economic sanctions.
But thanks to Turkish leaders in St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin felt that Ankara needed these partnerships more.
However, both of them suffered.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked like a slot and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual abstinence.
On the other hand, Tayjips Erdogan appointed Putin at least five times as his "dear friend", a news meeting review.
I don't have a number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan would act as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, the rising cold in Putina shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was that the Russian plane crashed at the Syrian border.
Moscow was then reacting to the axis.
Putin accused Ankara of being angry with the bastard in Moscow's back.
The transition was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoration of true faith will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public position of Russia has changed since November.
For months, government-controlled television has been spreading aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that everything was Turkish.
The most serious accusation was that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled Syria.
Of course he didn't.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that the time has come to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could take it as its kind of victory.
The benefits of the Ankara peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all potential friends after the failed turn last month when he was trying to gas.
The countless terrorist attacks have also ruined his position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russia's sanctions have led to substantial losses, in particular the charter ban, which usually ensures a flood of millions of Russian tourists each year in Turkey's resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tourists and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are renewed.
They look forward to vacation heat in the Mediterranean season according to the season.
This week, national TV already provides for a reduction in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quoted: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry at the West for their weak response to the turnout attempt.
All of this can also be seen as a dissatisfaction with the long-standing negotiations on the EU-Putina intervention, which is taking advantage of the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for his elected government after the roundup.
Consider that Moscow understands this well, because it itself is deeply rooted in fear of the regime’s change of state.
The summit, which took place in this Grenoble Sea Castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "distorted alliance", the two countries that feel excluded from the West combine forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacekeeper, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two presidents at the press conference announced that they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey has objectively avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes, when NATO member Turkey hit the Russian warplane, the situation has improved as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB will continue to play a role in support, as announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
There will no longer be available outside Scotland’s SMEs.
Ross Makevans tells BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has renounced these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost bankrupted and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in the branding strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations Regbie and ending with the Vimbledon tennis champion Andy Murey.
However, it is now decided to place other national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all the references of SMEs, outside the main office and the official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will be included.
Makevan was interviewed during his trip with customers and employees from Invernesshire.
He told BBC Scotland Channel: "SKB will become the brand of our investors and with which our employees work, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its sector and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we've been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very Chinese if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not on our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
France Detori won the 3000th victory, winning the first place in Newmarket with horse Predilection
The detoirs decouple the champagne by defeating their 3000th victory by finishing the first match in New York City twice.
On Friday, the jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining the first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in these races that took place in his hometown, with the predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that has achieved such results in horse racing.
He has joined Ser Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigota, Pete Ederie and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Detori, who had won before with the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York City, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big game, it is not a Royal Ascot, but it is a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I felt relieved and very grateful.
After winning, Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and applause.
Two jockeys have achieved this record competition with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the last 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning over 4300.
Lester Pigott, the ninth-ranking winner, won 4493 during his career.
France is one of the best jockeys today, and there is no surprise that he has made any progress that only a few can achieve.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactics are different from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic competition representative, his enthusiasm and for the years of charisma attracts fans to this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsoma's fights, I told Frankie that he had already won 6,000 wins if he hadn't only participated in the end of the week and in the big games.
However, it is a real joy that France has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He is a lively man who makes excellent use of British matches, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his signature - a flying decision.
From the wind speed of completion to the flying fate, Frances Detori has been a British horse racing face for twenty years.
This has been the full path of the experience.
He has won countless major competitions, including the famous 1996 "Great September" in Ashkot, and has also survived an aircraft crash and a disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength, challenging those who doubted him back in his best form.
And he could take part in the competition for some more time - Detori has previously said that he would like to continue the competition at least by the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses the director of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russia's President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly resigned from the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putina’s closest circle for many years.
A 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative in nature and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "has decided to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the Head of the Russian President's Administration", without stating the reason.
In place of Ivanov, Anton Vaino was appointed as his deputy since 2012.
At 44 years of age, Vaino is a diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (IMSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As reported by the Kremla website (Russian), he later managed the administration of the President's protocol and government officials.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as the President of the State, by drawing up laws and by controlling the implementation of your decisions.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to quit his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Is the smile convincing?
This step has shaken Moscow.
Sergei Ivanovs is a sense and close to Vladimir Putin's community and, like Putin, was working at the Soviet Security Service at the VDK.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the national television meeting, both men reported that Ivanovs had resigned from office on his own initiative.
But despite the laughter of the cameras, which is rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows.
However, the official statement that a man who was considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russia's environmental policy is perceived with great scepticism.
In comments published on the Kremla website Ivanovs tells Putin: "This is the fact that in early 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this complex role, even a problematic role, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was appointed in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the VDK State Security Service, like Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service that succeeded the VDK, Ivanovs took over as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov a number of people he trusted most.
At the end of Putina's second term, Ivanovs was considered a potential candidate for Russia's presidency, since the transfer of Putina to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
At that time, however, another close companion of Putina, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
Fish show in a garden in Banfas
A man from Banfa is asking for help to find out what conditions the fish have found in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sand ducks who left with a water rod.
Mr. Beina, who lives some 500 meters from the sea, published a video of fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these five centimeters of large fish came into his garden.
Kvinsferi crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Kvinsferian crossroads and viaducts, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the building of the bridge is nearing the end.
The Faifas bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project we see an indestructible engineering solution where only more than 30,000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process requiring enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the last stage that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be inserted today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for loading.
Michael Martins, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the engineering of the highest class.
After the last phase of the road and its connection with the North Tower support, we were left to connect the North Road phase with a part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by awaiting a part of the north access viaduct 700 mm south.
It was a huge and very delicate operation at the same time.
Great because the pipeline is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be dragged by about 3 %.
Delicate, since the tolerance in both directions of the team was only a few millimetres.
Luckily, everything worked out fine.
Simon Bails gets gold on women's hand.
Forget about the tensions.
Forget the distraction.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it all.
Dynamic jumps.
No effort shall be made to carry out the turns to the beam.
Impossible on the floor.
It's completely innocent.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 - year - old Americans won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points 62,198 was more than the result of the winner of the silver medal and her team member Alia Raisman and the winner of the bronze medal of the Russian sportsman Alia Mustafina.
On Thursday, US sportsman Simona Bailsa won the finals of the individual multi-stakeholder championship for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Riodezáneiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row who won the title of the multi-stakeholder and the fifth best winner, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best winner of his generation and possibly the best winner in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them in to such insurmountable athletes as Michael Felipe, who raised his sport type at another level.
Bails has dominated in his sport for the last three years by winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing so excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of winnings that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mérija Lu Retone called him "the best winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil she was faced with a final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes that had come upon her, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if I went back to my home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
The US athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alija Raismane mourn after the respective winnings of the gold and silver medal in the finals of the individual race for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Riode Janeiroiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making special selection coordinators Martas Karolii adjuvanted.
Although Bailsa claims that she had not expected anything like that in her long journey to fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would perfectly fit into the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her parents when she was still a baby and who was discovered by coach Eimis Burman's mother on a sports trip to the gym where the Burman's gymnasiums were held has become the force to be counted.
She has not lost in multi-racial competitions since the 2013 Summer and Victory Series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafina was slightly in control during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance sheet and free movement - part of the competition, where Bailsa will defend her title of the championship, is still only ahead.
She took the lead with a result of 15,433 on the left and strengthened her leadership with a result of 15,933 free movements
Raisman gently caught her while she waited for the results that were just formality and she burst into tears of joy when she realized the dream she had once recorded in her book of notes.
Raisman’s result was a small activism for four years of old events when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but lost her fight for bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, called the Americans, came up with convincing leadership.
After a successful free movement, which raised her doubts about her return, she was able to pour air into the shower.
Until 19 years old, Bails' viral Twitter record r, which she published this week, already has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahais Browns is being shot in Philadelphia.
Police report that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that he is already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it is Mahaj Brown.
The parents say Brown was shot several times, including a circus, a leg, a hand, and a stomach, but he was still aware when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Melendez told the television: "She was just a small body that had broken the windows."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start his first class at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people who were shot in the German capital.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
Canal CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two sufferers are stable.
The Canal reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car near the age of 29 in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of them had been attacked.
The investigator told the channel CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were most likely involved in the shooting.
Place of occurrence are gun cartridges belonging to various weapons.
It seems to have been a long shot.
The two sides of the corridor are in the middle of the tunnel.
"So it seems that there have been several armed shooters here who actively participated in the shooting," says Philly Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
Damages have also occurred in several homes and cars.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance camera records.
On the second day of the shooting, some six - year - old girl was stabbed in the hand while she was playing in front of her home in the West.
She's getting better, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabbie, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Women's Olympic Lightweight Team for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, this team has three small teams, Simon Bails, Gabia Douglas, and Laury Hernandez, who are inspired by many young women of origin.
People may be proud that this team also includes Aliya Raismane, a Jew and Madison Cocian, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best winner has been an African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabbia took place in 1st and 2nd places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabia Douglas became a surprising Olympic champion, and America was able to win.
Now the world has seen the incredible rewards of the three-time World Champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, performing unexpected, but masterful rewards.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row, winning gold medals for women in an individual multiracial race.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
Simona, Gabbia, and Laurie joined the Olympics, as did Alicia and Madison.
They are the "Olympian Five" because the next Olympic winning team will be only four athletes, and this is coach Martha Karola's last year coaching.
In fact, hugging is a expensive sport. The fans mainly train in private light-cold clubs, and keep them parents who pay for trainings, rooms, travels, fashion styles, hotels ( trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in urban areas that can allow this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take away all their trainings, and it is a precious and long contribution to light families.
Amy Bürman - Simona Bails' coach and Maggie Hainia - Laurias Hernandez's coach has trained her athletes since the two girls started working with light athletics.
We need to ensure that young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabia, and Laurie are able to take more expensive exercise.
I established my lightweight organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer training for over 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will discover a branch in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Lightweight develops strength, joints and body coordination, as well as learns hard work, discipline and meeting goals.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both in school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to practice in light-duty and it's fantastic.
Working on this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Ali, Gabia and Madison for the excellent demonstration of "The Girl Power" by winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and by motivating countless young, different girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of the offer by Jeremiah Hunt, the young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the UK Medical Association, but rejected it by 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunts announced plans to conclude the contract, stating that NHS is in an unstable state and that further delays are only to the detriment of workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night and at the end of the week in order to improve working conditions in unstandard working hours.
Yesterday, the representative of the new doctors of BMA, Dr. Elena Makourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors will sign the new contract, so progress should be made as time is short.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiation have been affected by the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes by complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunts said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop idle and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not, the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to the picket.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the United Kingdom Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work per week for 54 000 young doctors who are covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimers invited the young doctors to strike.
Mr. Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything but only increase the pressure on the workers and worry, create stress and obstacles for patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the new Committee of Doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions have responded positively to their questions about caregivers and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as staff placement, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay in medicine - suggests that employers, the English Health Education Authority and the Ministry of Health want to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription may reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack could be treated with 2 pounds a day, as officials recommend that they take more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart beat, reducing the risk of repeated heart beat.
NHS-represented NICE recommends that this medicinal product be used 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with heart and blood vessels problems.
However, the NICE currently in charge of NHS recommends that this medicine be used 4 years after the heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
About 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack every year, and one fourth of them experience a repeated heart attack or stroke.
Heart strikes and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart walls by forming prosthetics.
If the barrier breaks, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart strike.
On the other hand, if the thrombus separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block access to the brain by causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of a repeat heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years of 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Carol Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medicines for the prevention of repeated heart beats, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart stroke experience another heart stroke or stroke, often with serious consequences."
Fears of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on the quality of life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks and heart attack in people who have experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used longer than this deadline.
Culture of political correction promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to the management report, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahman, was released from office in connection with corruption.
The Government's report reveals that the culture of political correction attracts the eyes to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eriks Pikles criticises the police, election supervisors and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process because "they fear to affect the ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of the community, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the induction of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that police should be allowed to put guards at the polling stations in order to protect the indicted voters.
He also recommends that voters should produce a certificate of persons when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, only the name and address of the voter must be indicated.
He even recommends marking the voter's fingers with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs also need to provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He believes that the press should gain greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent fraud, but also to protect the local government from the widespread corruption and culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauningstrita following a scandal in connection with the elections of the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the special election court decided to abolish the city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city mayor's office because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "scinically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and blinded his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his campaign of election by saying that the religious duty of believers is to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were either false or questionable, since one person had voted several times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to vote in favour of a post where the elders of the Muslim community forced others to vote for themselves.
Sir Erik recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving the identity of the person.
His report states: "The evidence shows that members of the unprotected ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the oldest elected candidates in the community, especially in the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There are concerns that regional institutions are not paying attention to these problems due to political correction because they could affect the ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Erik made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working by post to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report by Tereza Meja also calls for a more thorough examination of registration in order to prevent the use of voters' lists for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility before the vote to ask voters to produce a document proving a person.
Mark the fingers of voting voters with special ink to prevent a double vote.
Systematically check the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set three-year limitation requests for automatic postal voting.
To prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes transferred by post and polling stations to vote by post.
Ensuring the police's powers to appoint guards at the polling stations.
To amend the law to facilitate the summoning of persons to responsibility for indictment under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Disable photographing in the selection box.
Set the requirement to use only English (except Velsa) in the voting preferences.
Enhancing training to ensure that voters go to polling stations on a single basis.
Sir Eriks is probably criticizing the Metropolis police, saying that there are no complaints in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says, "The election court has only disqualified Luftura Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was found to be guilty of the standard of proof of criminal law on the basis of irrevocable evidence.
He also criticises the ineffective city council electorate in the "cash check" of voter registrations.
Sir Erik points out: "Last year's court decision is an alarm call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the disturbing and hidden spread of the fraud of the elections and the institutionalisation that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Ride with a wheeled rider - Keitas fellows and other Rio Olympic celebrities
In 2016, the fans of the Rio Olympics were thrilled by the French cyclist Paulin Ferrand Prevot, whom the fans recognized as extremely similar to the Cambridge hercogen.
However, a 24 - year - old rider is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, which, according to the media, boasts of his glorious companion.
Therefore, for the honor of Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which are quite similar to the Hollywood stars.

CBC Olympics commenter apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has been 'finished like a pig'.
A 14-year-old analysis of Bairon Macdonalda in the fourth place of Ai Yanhas finish 4x200 m free-style bar in women’s staphyte, caused an earthquake in the CBC viewers.
Canada's channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the competition had "flighted out of the competition that he had died alone" and "ended like a pig".
Commenter Bairon MacDonald thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m of free-style staffing women finally expressed their personal opinion.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC's commentary team to give comments on life, said, "This little 14-year-old from China can't keep up with her".
"The more she fell asleep, the more she got out of the race, the more she just suffocated and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Tailor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers all over Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and statements.
Emets Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC comment directly just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig?"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still in the straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were called "a small 14-year-old from China who doesn't have it with her."
Criticism against Bairon MacDonald quickly came into force because many asked for explanations.
Twitter users could not believe when they heard the insensitive comments of Bairon Macdonald.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then conducting the CBC live broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize that the comment on the result of swimming was reflected in the straight ether."
It was a poor choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
MacDonald's colleague Scott Russell came to apologize for his position.
CBC then apologized to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Macdonalda's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and came to the direct ether.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all the viewers and followers of the social media.
In the interests of clarity, it should be said that Bairon’s comments were made on the performance of the swimmer rather than addressed to her personally.
However, in any event, they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully selected statements and the Bairon was very sorry for what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized to the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In the live broadcast of the CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to use the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's free-style competitions."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not his personal performance.
I have not thought of showing disrespect, and I am really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who accidentally fits into the basement store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress up in order to put her pants in the middle of the store.
Even worsening the situation, she agreed to make sure that they were handing over to her and then withdrew by putting her pants back in her pocket.
She continued looking for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping center and wore four more pants.
Primark shop Bouverie Place at the shopping center of Folkeston – the place where this woman held the underwear and then put it back in her lungs.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, said that an unknown woman, after wearing her underwear, wore her clothes and left her shop without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
As she stood in the middle of the store, she took off her underpants, took off her socks and underpants, and measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she just kept them on the spot.
Everyone looked at his pants and apparently didn’t like them because she just put them back in her pocket.
She measured three more trousers until she decided that none of them liked her and left the store.
It did not seem that he would be attracted to someone who was looking or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Davidson's novelist (33 years) from Kent says: "Derds think that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by another person and which are not washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's novelty adds: "I assume that after she left, the shop staff removed those clothes from the store's lungs - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has taken them and then they're not washed.
Primark pointed out that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothes are removed from the store’s lungs.
How to Protect Yourself From Guns Using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves close to the attackers with a gunman, we spoke to the Grandmaster of Krav Maga from New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get a grip on the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, it is necessary to turn first to see clearly the attacker and avoid any such route.
Then the weapon must be held between his front hand and his shoulder and made a seat on the opponent’s face with his free helmets.
Then follow the seat with the way around and as the attacker gets in pain, he must take off his weapon, stand on his face with his arms and step back and continue to turn his weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - one must be avoided, the weapon must be restrained, and it must be disarmed so that the wicked cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and a sit-down on the enemy’s chests and finally withdraw his weapon and refrain from continuing to discuss it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misraki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's master, it's safer to give your money to the kidnapper.
The vandal family demolishes the Saltash Kornvola's social home and is laid on the street.
The hydrogen family has been removed from the neighborhood's habitat for terrorism, causing damage to the social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skledon and her partner Sean Trebilkoks are only separated from the property in Saltaš Kornvol, as several complaints have been lodged against them.
When they were forced out of the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
In the floors and walls there were leaks, garbage was emptied everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now separated from the property and is likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoya, the manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there is a concern that the house will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult, and she feels that it is impossible for people to live there.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed, as this property in Kornvol will not have a good reputation in future.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
The couple had three sons who had been regularly owned and the police said their terror was expressed as violence, street fights with baseball bats, incest of locals, drug use, drug sales, and noise abuse and robbery.
In June, 47 - year - old Sheldon was convicted of antisocial behavior.
Waste is found in several demolished rooms.
In the home, where drugs are previously available, several floors have also been removed.
Neighbors say they've hit the street regularly and been called police all the time.
The Kornvola Housekeeping Service put them out of the house under pressure when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy to be left behind because their life had been absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often I've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because there was so quiet here - we haven't experienced it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatricks, who is the head of the neighbourhood protection of the Cornwall House Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called police.
Various old and unused items were found in the grown-up garden.
He also said: "It is very regrettable that the tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behavior, because expulsion from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornvola House Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard looking at their behavior.
I appreciated the work of all my team, Devona and Cornvola police and the members of the commune, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbors and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here for different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
A clean mattress, which remained on the floor in one of the rooms after being laid.
Service staff will now have to clean up the waste that is left at home.
In 2014, the police house did the screening and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeleton has only been found to be responsible for the storage of Class B drugs in order to distribute them.
She said that the money was meant to be a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being released, it has become known that they are currently renting private property in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house.
The police report that they will continue to expel tenants who violate their leases.
The representative of the Devona and Cornvola Police of Angela Krova points out that this omission is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can act as they want and there will be no consequences."
Devonas and Kronvolas police are not acceptable for criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

Kannu's knife has banned the burkina Fasoan swimsuits in the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Kannu has banned the wearing of burkina Faso swimwear in the beaches of this city, which almost completely covers the woman’s body and is very fond of the clothes, local officials announced on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have swimwear that respects good practices and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal clothing, which externally shows religious affiliation when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of public order disruption (breakdown, clashes, etc.) that is necessary to prevent," the order said.
"We are not talking about religious symbols banning the beach, but about outer clothing that relates to the movements of terrorists who are fighting us," explained the head of the municipality's municipal services, Terri Miguel.
He added that Burkina Faso swimsuits have not been seen on the Kannu beaches since July 28th, when the right-wing member of the Central Party "Republicans" Linars signed this order and it entered into force.
This week, the water park in the city of Marseille lifted planned private measures for Muslim women who were dressed in pools in swimsuits, as politicians of both the right and the left groups expressed their sympathy for such action.
In France it is prohibited to wear head coverings of Muslim women who sit on their faces, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Cannam, near the city of Nice, which was held by the Islamic State responsible group.
On July 26, two rebels who had vowed allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in the church in the northwestern France.

The festival "Cuban" started in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11, the evening of Lucavsal was given a start to one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cuba" until Sunday night.
In the first evening, groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, which was expected to be lost from the program, the American Panki "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
The next days of the festival also include valuable words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the founder of the Pancroque legend "Romanes" by Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg, "Brutto&Lyapis" by the white-wing pancroque leader Sergei Mihalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, the Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Cubana" takes place in Latvia.
Earlier, it suffered financial failure and enormous losses, but it did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a long term to the name, included in the program a group of Latvians (Friday 19:15 at the scene stage "All Day Long") and announced that the festival now became "closer and gained local color with symbols such as its panoramic and cat".
Whether these efforts are justified, too early to judge, because the festival just got in, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed in the first evening, at least temporarily huge efforts to attract people did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar to before.
The British RV team doubles the good Olympic record and wins the sprint.
On Thursday, the British Trek team twice repaired the Olympic record and won a sprint in the race for men.
Britain’s first Olympic record improved its qualification, but in the first place, it was restored by the New Zealanders.
The British team with New Zealand finally met, and the British took off the title of the newly-green Olympic record owners, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won with a result of 42,440 seconds, overcoming the new-greens by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team won Australia.
It should be noted that the record has also been revised in the qualification of female enrolment - the British team has improved the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustav Zemgal.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but the undeserved has remained in the shadow of Latvia's first president, Jan Chachstes, and last president, Karl Ulman, of the period before.
None of our fellow citizens have defended democracy and justice as well as Zemgal, in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal ten years ago, Arnold Auziņš.
In a conversation with the Delfi portal, Auziņš stresses that Zemgal is one of the few high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The others are rigid, always very correct.
He taught not to be, today it might be like who Raymond Vionis is.
"He was the one who was close to the people," said Auziņz.
Today’s politicians know bad stories, they refer to Karli Ulman as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how negative he was.
At the government meeting, General Balodis was the only person he was not crying to.
Even if he was kind and funny in the pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
"The earth with its sense of humor and democracy leaves the opposite impression," says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of Latvia in his conversation with Delfi agrees with the Auzini's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and well-deserved national.
He also notes that Zemgal stood up with respect to minorities, regularly calling on Jewish representatives to the President's castle.
"It was not customary at that time, after the Zemgal Presidency Albert Kweiss took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighed man who had long had to talk to become president.
He didn't do it himself, just don't starve.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he felt that the President must understand it.
"During the Presidency, the French language has learned the basics," explains Stranga.
The Land did not allow itself to be re-elected as a candidate, and he did not like such a high position.
In any case, he is a very valuable person in Latvia's history, and he was a very demanding notary before he entered the presidential palace.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgal, which was located in Suvorova Street 3, where the company of stockholders and stock issuers became the state of Latvia in practically government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great respecter of Ulman, but he was not publicly opposed.
"The private negotiations have sometimes said that Ulman's real actions do not support him," says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, no doubt about lawlessness or corruption.
How do the Zemgals remember today?
Unfortunately, for the most part, he only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, considered central.
"There were no major disturbances during her period, i.e. he could associate with such a truly stable Presidency," said Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustava Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to Latvia took place in Sweden, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and membership in the Northern European Democratic Nation family.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgal arrived at a national visit to Stockholm.
A visit to Latvia by King Gustav V of Sweden took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but he was born in January 1939.
Just ways to help a child deal with anger attacks.
I often have to deal with the anger of a child, the kindness of the parent’s behavior, and the mistaken attitude of the parent.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small discussion of these natural and human feelings - anger and intimacy that each one experiences periodically.
Aggression is already a physical action directed at other people, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset, we usually know what's going on with us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can sell a diner in anger, smoke a cigarette (it's not the best way to vent your anger!), go in the shower, take a bullet at the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know various other ways of dealing with these emotions.
When children get angry, they do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Oh far!", you're a fool, "Bad mom," "I'm not going to leave you," "I'm not going to go with you," and very rarely when you can say, "I'm angry at you."
Children live literally, they are right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly in expressing their feelings, and often they are also in the midst of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid their child from expressing anger, including anger, not to tell him or her in anger, but to help the child, on the contrary.
Should relations be suspended?
The day of the work of the spirit, in which everything has not happened as you would like, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "lock off" for a moment, a day or even longer from around the world.
Is it possible to break up relationships at the same time and make a little fuss?
However, does this indicate that each partner is on its own?
In his views, the gentlemen share in different ages.
John (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if the relationship is necessary, do not be with the real people."
Edward (30) has discovered a scheme that may be helpful.
If you feel that the partner is starting to bother you for every minor detail, then it's definitely the right time to explore other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or especially about her not thinking or even wanting to see her again.
So the answer is - yes, stopping a talk can help you save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relations should be held on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the memory of every detail that the second does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start talking to each other, especially if you don’t talk anymore, just about what you’ve done every day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that someone else or someone else is better - then why has this woman you're with earned someone who can think that there's no good enough and there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking is only a small task.
If it's not, it's not.
"I am, so I condemn a little those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment at a time.
You can't look into each other's eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and pretend to be a loveless one.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballet.
Everyone's got their time.
Of course, even for a Christian or a wife, however, if both are to maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can survive to the edge of the grave.
That's it, that's it.
Martišnius (27) says so: "It is difficult to say - whether or not it is necessary, may or may not take a break, but one is clear - to the proposer there is nothing in the relationship to the end, something missing."
If this question arises, then it should be calculated that there will be some change in the near future - on the right side or on the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think while you're still young and crazy, as long as you're tired of it - something all the time, but when everything's still serious and relationships go into a completely different phase, there can't be a speech for rest.
But you decide to spend all your life together!
"If you can't hold each other now and once in a while need a room, then what will happen when you're pensioners who comment on how long-lasting cats spoil or argue about where the garden needs to be repaired on the day," explains Kristaps (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.
With his emotional and emotional personality, Rosental first modulated the interest of the Latvian people in pictorial art.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain unforgettable for all time," wrote Romans Suta, an elderly Latvian artist, Jani Rosental.
Also in 2016, when the old master's wide retrospective exhibition was discovered in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rosantal is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide range of retrospects in the newly opened Grand Exhibition Hall of Year Artists Jani Rosentālu (1866-1916), which on the 50th day of birth at the international level is included in UNESCO's calendar of holidays.
The retrospective exhibition, which covers more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Jana Rosental’s annual anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the Latvian National Museum of Art stock, which represents the main stages of classical creative activities and genres, the diversity of stylistic change and techniques.

TopGear ("Gazi on the floor!") TV broadcast leader Mets Leblanks said he was anxious to return to the second season of the car show, but admitted that he did not know what was ahead of him.
At the moment, nothing officially happens.
"If so, the BBC will announce it," Leblanks discovered in a conversation with the TV critics.
Doubts about "Gazi on the floor!" the future arose in July when Leblanka's successor Chris Evans announced that he was leaving.
After his departure Evans admitted that Leblanks and "Gazi on the floor!" are "as created each other".
Evans of the former series "Friends" ("Friends") describes the stars as "a true and cruel man", thus pacifying the booms that both friends had lost during the filming.

Two bicycles were delivered to the hospital in Sigulda after the crash.
In Sigulda, on the Swiss street, two bikers collapsed, receiving various injuries, the State Police reported.
Men born in 1987 and 1990 were involved in the accident who were both delivered to the medical institution.
Also, in the fall of the Woods, a heavy biker.
In 1989 a man was born in 1905 and was brought to medical care.
In contrast, in the Dobeles municipality of Naudites, in 1989 a motorcyclist was born trying to avoid a dog that ran off the road and got drunk.
He's in the hospital, too.
On the last day, 71 road accidents were recorded in Latvia, involving 16 people.
Some place lies and gets later.
Even on Friday in Latvia some time is expected and will become a further degree later, agency LETA learned in the centre of Latvia's Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
It's possible for places to swallow a peacock.
According to forecasts, rains are expected mainly in Kurzeme and in the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will only be within +16, +19 degrees.
The day ends in Riga without falling and mostly the sun shines.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backdrops of the U.S. model business have gained perversion in his interpretation of the glossy photo session and the impatience of the horror movie.
In essence, it is very provocative, on the balancing work of fragmentation and banal vulgarity, in which the borders between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question whether the parents' conceptually chosen life models (ecology, vegetarianism, alternative and restraint from consumer ignorance and values) bring blessings or destructive to their children.
The idealist father of six children after the death of a wife is faced with questions about the correctness and true values of the choices.
An exciting, lively film by Mets Ross this year won the Canna festival award for the director..
Of course, sharks do this only as an attack on the girls - in the gorges it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, presented by Blake Shipley.
The work demanded her strong strength.
This survival solo number can be compared to James Franko's performance in a 127-hour film exhibition and Rayen Reynolds' game in a film.
It may also be the fault of the main role of the artist, Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the model of a creative survivor and the family value captivator seem to be created only by a completely lost fantasy of Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic state of Syria has captured 2000 civilians.
In the Syrian province of Menbiža, Syrian Aleppo, the Islamic nation's fighters seized about 2000 civilians, who were used as a living force, and announced on Friday the supported Kurdish and Arab alliances and observers in the United States.
"We didn't shoot them because they took civilians with them while they were fleeing to Jerabulus," said the Kurdish Menbiz Military Council's press representative.
Following two months of Kurdish struggles, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), which are supported by the US Kurdish-Arab Alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza has been released from the jihadists.
The Islamic state of Menbiz was adopted in 2014.
The QSD has already boosted most of the Islamic state fighters from Menbiža last week, but some of them have maintained and showed strong resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city by taking the winners with them.
Islamists go to Jerábulus, located at the Turkish border.
Also, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) based in London reported that about 2000 people were robbed of the Islamic State.
SOHR reported that the Islamists had stolen city cars, forced people to crash into them, and then taken them to Jerábulus.
Islamic nation fighters have also committed mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, more than 400 civilians, including women and children, were slaughtered in the territory of Deir ez Zoras in the eastern Syrian province of Syria.
Later, about 270 of the winners were released.
It is not known how many of Islam’s fighters have fled from Menbiza.
A representative of the Kurdish Menbiz Military Council reported that the QSD has managed to save 2,500 people who have been captured by the Islamists in Menbiz.
The information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the Menbiz fight.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Colleagues refuses to apply for the VID leader's office.
The Director of the Public Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, decided to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of the Public Revenue Service (VID), informed the agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Koļgova points out that the consultation of her candidacy has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more frequent, invisible interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It's not acceptable to me, too," he said.
In the event that her candidacy is approved by the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to the VID to be fully worked out and realized, with the support of the entire government.
Without it, full work would not be possible, Collegiate concludes.
"I have often publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all of my candidacy process is too politicised," explains the official.
"Thank you for the confidence and support I have shown, it is the experience that I appreciate as a benefit," in Reizniece-Ozolai's presentation, Kolīgova.
On Wednesday, the unit said that during the meeting with Koligov there were "substantial contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends by SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs meetings provide for no profit to be shared.
Currently, Deputy Director General Dace Pelek is in charge of the VID.
In Lithuania, the police are involved in the rescue of two young children without supervision, the Government of the Latvian Police Region is informed.
The information on unsupervised wheels with babies was received on Friday at about 7 p.m.
They are located in Lebanon at the former store building.
Both young girls are immediately handed over to the medical authorities for assistance.
In addition, the bicycles also left a purse with documents and a mobile phone.
Within half an hour, law enforcement revealed the possible location of the children’s parents and went there.
When the women came to the civilian house, the police found that the woman was asleep because she was in a strong alcohol mood.
After the first day of the evening of the information, in 1992, a woman was born to a congregation where she used alcohol.
As soon as she went home after the meeting, the woman decided to leave the children at the store in undisclosed circumstances.
The police immediately informed the court, which would also decide on the child’s further fate.
Riga Freeport has introduced all recommendations from the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Freeport Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of State Control (VK) on the development of the infrastructure project on the Russian island to move port activities from the city centre, the portal Dina.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the nearest Riga Freeport Board meeting.
In order to implement the recommendations, in accordance with the opinion of the PSC, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Office also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the International Auditor Deloitte in Riga Freeport and the recommendations made to improve project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Freeport administration does not agree with the opinion of the UK on the feasibility of implementing the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned constructions under the project have been completed in full within the time limits and the planned amount.
"To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also to the supporters that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says Sanita Kaire, Head of the Russian island project.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring of the project's objectives was complemented by the key planned actions of the parties involved, the necessary decision-making deadlines, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring instruments of the planned construction process and the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project's objective by 31 December 2018 is complemented by implementing monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the duration of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project by Riga Freeport.
A project management plan has been redesigned to improve the management of the project and to address potential risks by defining the areas of management of the project and specifying the documents drawn up to provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme has been developed to enhance project capacity, reflecting the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve the communication between the Riga Freeport administration and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed between the parties concerned and the parties to the project action plan, defining the principles, types and periodicity of the project for successful completion of the project.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, further details will need to be given to the need to enter into a service contract or purchase, and to the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a global port infrastructure compatible with world standards - four new deep-water ports, railways and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the past year, resulting in a savings of EUR 10.6 million.
As a result of threats, the safety of airports has been enhanced in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Ministry of the Interior announced.
"In view of the threats, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprada and Kosica", a press representative of the Slovak Ministry of Interior told the news agency on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia on 16 September, with the participation of all the countries of the bloc, with the exception of the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the EU's future without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to new studies, the number of casualties at the former East German border in the south could be much higher than previously thought, but there is still no doubt about the true number of victims.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with the western public areas and the later West German Communist authorities have killed 1841 people who tried to leave their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating cases of border-related deaths for years and is adjusting the number of victims at the moment.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims, including some six-year-old boy, who was killed in an attempt to reach the family through the then Czechoslovak and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double scourge of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Alexander Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the capital of those who have died trying to escape from a Communist-controlled state is maintained and not lost," says Hildebrande's widely distributed statement.
Other researchers, however, have questioned the new figures.
"Number 1841 is unconvincing", in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, an expert at the history of the Berlin Free University of Austria, Johans Statts.
He and other researchers at the Berlin Free University are currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to approve only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only 138 people were killed by the communists at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is much less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of the Eastern border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If the elderly are between 70 and 80 years of age after they have faced border control, they must be affected by these "drinking limits", Hildebrant is considered.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their experience and those who have caused long-term waiting on the bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims' record, it is not easy because the Communist authorities of Eastern Germany have not collected such statistics and researchers need to use documents in various scattered archives, the State indicates.
However, the State party has recently produced new documents and could therefore be presented in the near future with an estimate of the number of new victims.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with the coach's accreditation; this is a surprise for himself.
In recent days, the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) President Kaspars Pone Riodezaneiro has come to the Olympic Games with the coach's accreditation, but he is surprised.
On Wednesday, a wide range of agiotage arose after the remarks of Olympic swimmer Allonas Ribakova, coach German Jakobovska, who discovered that at the last moment on Riodezneiro, he decided to go to Pone while the coach had to stay home.
Originally on the list of drivers, the swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakobovski and Dave Collins, as well as the Federation President Pone, were approved.
The Latvian Swimming Federation reported five participants to the Olympics, and before leaving, Aldon Vrublävskis claimed that Germany would be and was looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," said Mr, expressing his opinion that it did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, the Uvja coach agreed to help her.
Mr., who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, was probably criticising the operation of LOK, leading to blame for the monitoring organisation of Olympic sports.
In my view, it is not ethical to approve five persons in the LOC Executive Committee and not to withdraw one of them.
"I don't know why exactly the Swimming Federation does not have enough seats," Mr. Pone said that the work of the Federation and its presidents has not been evaluated in society, recalling that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticised Jakobovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained at the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. could not tell why he was in the Olympics with a coach's accreditation, who probably had to go to Jakubovski.
"I was nominated as the head of the Federation ("the team leader"), but for some unknown reason I got the coach's accreditation and now I'm not going anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I think that German will be because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakova started she had had a conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had had tears in her eyes, but the LPF President himself said it was a daily conversation with a desire to be a sportsman before the start.
Pone recalled that the LPF monitors five sports that are part of the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that it was also very important in Latvia for the swallowing issues and for such programmes he spoke about, Riodežaneiro having been here for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that the World Cup stage could be dealt with in Latvia in 2018.
Located in Riodežaneiro is not my vacation, here I work, spend my time and try to implement four-year programmes.
There will be 600,000 kids in the crowd.
During the renewal programme of AS Latvenergo fish resources in Daugava this week, the introduction of salmon and tuna in Mangalsala is being carried out, and this year more than 600,000 uniform salmon and tuna are planned to be introduced by the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue for the following months - 6 300 000 species of fish and poultry are introduced in Daugava pool water pillars in general each year.
In the spring of 2016 and early summer, the ladders and the foothills will be released, in June - sigas, in July - spring salmon, in August and September - roses and vimbas.
Latvenergo’s production director, Māris Kunickis, told us that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"In measures to protect and multiply fish resources, any action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by raising and introducing fish children in the Daugava pool and by carrying out other activities," said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600,000 single - year - old salmon and teeming babies will be introduced into the Daugava estate.
For the second year before the introduction, small fish are marked by cutting off fat.
Today's cargo contains 25 000 salmon babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
The introduction of fish chicks and cockroaches takes place in the composition and quantity of scientificly justified species each year in Daugava and its pools.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its pools in the waters shall be carried out by Bior, in accordance with the regulatory acts, on the basis of the expertise of the economic activity of Latvenergo and the conclusion of the compensation measures to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environment Service shall, on the basis of that expertise, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the recovery programme shall be EUR 1,035 000.
In the spring of 2016, in cooperation with the company "We Fishing" 400 artificial fish nests are located in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikskóile.
Cooperation with the company through the promotion of fish stocks is also supported by the Latvenergo initiative within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
The placement of artificial nests in a watershed is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugav.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" is a rural courtyard, forest, a circus.
Sleeping in the tent, eating as a restaurant, walking around the chain and listening to the camera music being investigated, enjoying the quiet nature of nature, such a combination offers an alternative camera music festival in Sansusī, which already invites to the district of Aknište in the third summer.
The festival will take place in Susai - a non-existent village - in the former farmhouse, next to forests and meadows.
Within three days - from 12 to 14 August - five views can combine the exquisite pleasure of nature and academic music.
Here with music comes the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its most recent expressions, find new audiences in a free and open environment without concerts.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but up to a smile on the face and light on the foot only a few minutes.
"Please don't look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance so that people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansus can only be realized by spending all three days in it," says the festival's initiator and host, operabariton Armands Silišn.
The festival doors will be opened Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert will be held at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be programs on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we suggest Saturday, because it is the most polluting - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Silinš.
The beautiful artist bouquet includes, for example, the violinist Eva Bindere, the violinist Kristíne Blaumane, the opera star Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter Janis Porietis, the pianist Reinis Zariņš, the Quartet Quadra and RIX, and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Erikus Kirsfeld, Martinus Zilbert and actress Anci Strazdu created a contemporary circus show on the internal struggle of the artist.
New work has also been made especially for the festival.
In the exhibition for children "Kukainis", composed by Olėsja Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nimanis, the entomologist (student researcher) Ugis Peterāns will participate with Armandus Silinius, musicians and actors.
Oscar Herliņš won the first Stylish Quartet, while Anna Čirse - wooden opera, whose main heroes in Andra Kalnozola's mode with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and Andra Egliša's scenography will be wooden in three small jars in three hectares in the large quay.
In the voices of Laimas Icedines, Dinar Rudánes and Zigmar Gras, they will enter into romantic relations, just as the scientist in the study of the light age of Swedish natural science Karl Linnej at the Woods Marriage (1729).
Today, one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation is the 17th athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidina.
Ikauniece-Admidina will start at 15.35 after the time of Latvia the race will start at 100 meters in the barrier level, but at 16.50 a.m. the competition will be expected to rise.
On the other hand, on Saturday at 2.35 p.m., the ball will start to burn until 4.05 p.m. - 200 m. sprint.
Seventy competitions will be concluded on Saturday, when the distance, tearing and 800 m running will take place.
Prior to the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidina, which was previously awarded bronze at the World Championship, was mentioned as an Olympic medal candidate.
In May, Latvia set up a new national record (6622 points) and scored the second place in the prestigious seven-thousand competitions in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidina also took part in the 2012 London Olympics when she scored the ninth place with a re-recorded Latvian record.
During the last two and a half years, the athlete has corrected the national record four times.
Today, the start at 16 p.m. is also scheduled for Latvian judo cichston Arthur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first round with Azerbaijani sportsman Ushangi Kukauri.
Judith will have these first Olympics in her career.
The agency LETA has already reported that on Thursday, the weight of the loss of up to 100 kilograms in its first fight was already experienced by the Latvian judo cichston Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He joined the Japanese Hagu Runoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolod Zelonijs brought the honour of the Olympic Bronze to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, the Latvian Jews in the seven struggles together won only one victory, which was made in London by Borodavko.
At 16.30 p.m., after the time of Latvia's qualification competition, Dainis Upelnieks will start shooting, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The Ombudsman received the Olympic passport only on the day of the official announcement of the composition of the Latvian delegation, but later he revealed to the agency LETA that he had been quite sure of driving since April.
The sportsman arrived at the venue of the Olympics as one of the first athletes in Latvia, trying to make the most of the opportunities for the competitions in the shooting.
19.05 After the final three trips of Latvia's time, the 17-year-old Olympic debutant, Katie Birzule, will take place in the race for fans in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips, Birzule is currently in 25th place among 26 athletes.
On Saturday, the finals of the medals will take place.
Today, it is also planned to take part in a competition in the academic field in which the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pušpuri, is to take part.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Half-final C/D will be increased at 19.10 p.m. for women fighting for the 13th place at the Olympics.
On the second day of the fourth final ride, she kicked out the fourth place, from the third position, which would allow the fight for the medal to continue, leaving for 0,65 seconds.
Pušpure 13th place was destroyed four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 medal sets will be divided into Olympics – round shooting, light-duty, towing, towing, towing, trampling, judo, academia, shooting, swimming, tennis and weighing.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected President, she will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Democratic Party of the Senate, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will appoint Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed him.
The Senate's majority leader, Michs Maconnells, said that the next president would be elected to replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skalius.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reed’s representative later told me that he had not personally discussed this subject with Clinton and that they are merely speculations.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "screw the ship" with another choice.
Garland is the principal judge of the Court of Appeal of the U.S. Columbia District.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "objects" and act in the interests of the President of the Republican Party candidate Donald Trappa.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for the president's work.
Treatments shall be notified of caliphous calendars for women and men.
The magazine Treats will cooperate with photographer David Belmer to create a 2017 calendar in the style of Pirelli in the 70th century.
In its 2017 NU Museum calendar, it is planned to demonstrate new supermodels, not kilas celebrations.
At the beginning of this year, President Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art journal is different from old Playboy because "Playboy is a man's journal".
This magazine is for women.
He seems to be talking about a calendar too.
In a press release on the creation of a calendar, Shaw writes: "We must return to the images of insatiable and classical hypocrisy, where the woman's body does not die, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos in electronic or personally chatting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the most living spine - video view
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life ever from all the spines on our planet.
A shark researcher named Julius Nielsen says that the life record belongs to a mother who could be between 272 and 512 years of age and five meters long.
The French court rejects the requirement to destroy shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the requirement of the authorities in Kale to destroy dozens of self-created shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court meeting this week in Kale, the authorities indicated that the country should destroy 72 self-constructed shops where people sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some of the euro-constructed restaurants.
In Kale, the Prefect’s Office pointed out that these self-produced companies must be reformed because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because food provided by government and support groups does not provide the needs of the camp where the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-produced shops and restaurants often offer free snacks and food to those most in need.
The small court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-created shops, but that it understands the concerns of the prefect in Kale.
Judge Jean-Français Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a more important role than simply providing food for people who live in "extremely uncomfortable conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of destruction is the Jungle Book Kids camphouse, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language activities and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult escorts.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
The Guardian's letter states that the disposal of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organisations "Aid for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" announced that the number of people in the "Jeunglich" camp has increased to 9000 people, the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain is gaining silver regbia-7 in a series fight when Fiji National Union is mastering gold.
The impressive performance of the UK sample in the Regbija-7 series ended on Thursday, when the Rio Fiji national unit convinced them that they were buried with the result 43:7 at the exciting finals of Deodoro.
Fiji demonstrated the masterclass in the management of the bomb, played the bomb with foot, support game, and brutal force in the game, beating the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The Sakáve brings a prize of respectable calm – a silver medal that was then the third of Britain. The UK selection can boast of its achievements in the first Olympic Regbie-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy struggle at the semi-final, where the Boks team suffered a stroke with the result of 7:5 days in the first half, may have been played at the end of the Great Britain.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
Although unlikely, the British may have a certain comfort that at least one British won the gold medal. It is the main trainer of the Fiji Selection Ben Ryans - the former English coach from Vimbledon.
Britain had an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Rayna's leadership, they lost all the game regbia-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Sickness is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji was impressed by the cat’s opening of the British force’s way of life.
Captain Tom Mitchell and the brothers were as if they were meeting with a number of bus drivers and World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Collins got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai has also increased his overpowering by making the landing on the right wing.
Result 12:0 and the British team were not even really hit by the bomb.
Michel’s great power did not allow the typical Leon Nakarav to achieve three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua won the right-hand landing, strengthening the dominance over Britain by 17:0.
After the game, Nakarava was even more overpowering and was left to the end for more than a minute... at the end of the first half-life.
Vatemo Ravuvoo avoided some inefficient British forces and crossed the line by obtaining points.
The ground floor provided the result 29:0.
There will be that Fiji was born to play regbie-7 in cats while the British were just learning.
In fact, that's true too.
The British team made profound changes in half-time, crossing Fiji's line of players... full of four minutes, which after the first half-time standards was good until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, got some more points on Fiji's team.
Den Norton managed to get points for the British team by landing on the left corner and achieving the 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the South Sea saloon fans sang, chanted flags and danced in the Tribes.
It is not surprising that Fiji has a lifelong attitude.
Mata Villame made Fiji even more sweet with another landing at the end of the game.
When the game was over, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British could sit in the hall only after a break.
On the first half of the day, Fiji conquered Japan with a result of 20:5, while the British were too much over South Africa, where in a very tough fight both teams won on the ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the season, Kyle Brown made a lead on the Boks team, but in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line with a brilliant skill and delivered a bomb between the poles, providing British victory.
Marcus Vatson, who is the brother of Antonia, an English regbie-15 team player, the great power method at the end of the game provided the team with a win and another silver medal.
The coach' fight against cancer inspired Helen Glovier and Heteri Stanning to win the air race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, the golden fragment of Helena Gloves and Hethers Stanning was of particular importance on the path of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams's support, which inspired her to the second Olympic gold medal for women in the ironing of couples, becoming the first women in British sports history who have made such progress.
She certainly dominated because she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory 39 times.
Both great athletes with the elegance of the floor sliding across the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a whole team behind each gold medal that works hard to continuously improve its performance and the greatest contribution they have made to their success by a coach who did not know or will experience this day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to her, it disappeared as quickly as it turned out.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated, and so did it.
If I didn't, it would spread all over the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
In December 2013, Williams was diagnosed with cancer.
This was due to the fact that William was able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-seasonal period and to reduce the duration of the break to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I moved 6, 10 and even 30 feet [15 m] long, even though the doctor said that I would take some steps.
It all started.
Driving itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought immediately came to mind about William, who had been very anxious and excited all morning, talking more than usual.
Staninga, who served at the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much Helen and Robin have worked.
Helen and Robin have been great for 3 years.
Without Robin, we would have achieved nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine better coaches or better coaches.
Helena Glovere and Hetre Staning have not lost in any race for five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even the last 500 meters when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, Staning and Gloves were too big.
We felt every moment.
Helena shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time, we had little hope.
On that day, we did not intend to miss the record, but we simply flew well and won the race, and we did.
It will take a few years to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the wedding of the searcher, Steve Bashal, of Gloves and television adventures.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last game.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Colleagues as head of the VID will "go to the last".
According to her, now Prime Minister Mari Kučinski (Green and Farmers' Union) and Finance Minister Dani Reizniecei-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union) are already "principally important" for the approval of the candidate led by the Minister of Finance Koļegov as head of the VID.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinski and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government, the VID leader's approval is "the first major decision", which can affect him as a politician's future.
If the position of the VID leader is now changed in the selection of the candidate, it will have a negative impact on the governance of their imagery.
The next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the transfer of the Head of the VID to the VID, as indicated by the government's agenda.
The Chief of Staff of Collegiate VID was led by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after Inar Peterson resigned from the management of the service and the invitation to tender for the post of Director-General of the VID ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, the CEO of the VID, Dace Pelėka, allowed the Latvian Radio in an interview - if she offered to run for the lead, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that there are no other candidates for the VID leader's office.
The Head of the Saeimas Group of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledged that NA still supports Collegv VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit threatens the failure to establish a government.
Before 12 July, the European Commission (EC) presented an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that despite the savings measures implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP and in Spain, 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets in the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on both of these countries is the growing European skepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative attitude.
Critics point out that the EC is not consistent with its decisions from the beginning with the agreement on common rules and subsequently with the failure to apply them in life.
For example, German Bank President Jens Weidmann pointed out that Europe thereby loses confidence in itself, creating an idea for citizens that the European Union rules are recommendable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and approved all Member States to extend the budget deficit adjustment period until the end of this year for Portugal and Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional savings measures, if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved at a certain time and that already this year the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of the gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this year's government needs to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP.
These measures should be included in this year's budget by paying further attention to the control of the costs of the purchase of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
Moreover, in the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government for eight months is making it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility of Spain being able to hold a pre-term parliamentary elections is increasing for the third time during the year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the third election would not change significantly in the country.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, of the People's Party, whose elections would once again win a 33% vote.
Its popularity has increased slightly only by socialists, while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "Ciudadans" or "Pilsons" against the measures of savings has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to get Socialists and Citizens involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit a draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission by mid-October.
As the representative of the parliamentary group of the People's Party has announced, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not successful and Parliament's elections will be held for the third time, Spain will become a laughingstock of Europe.
The purity of the beaches in the Riga Sea Bay is critical.
In a five - year survey of the beaches, activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of wastes found each year is increasing, and most of the visitors are guilty of this.
The most contaminated bathing areas are in Riga.
In the capital city council, it is clear that bathing is a daily gathering, but it is difficult to fight against unclean visitors.
In addition, waste left on land can be disposed of in water during the rainy season, resulting in severe damage to its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This statement has been circulated this week by the volunteers of the campaign "Mana Maria".
At the foot of the five - year - old Riga Sea Lake, activists have concluded that the number of wastes left by the population has increased by a hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year this evaluation of criticism has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes per 100 metres of the beach may perhaps exceed 200 units," says Mana María, representative of the expedition, Janis Ulme.
Latvian Radio called, he was located on the Tuva beach, where a volunteer walk will continue along the Riga Sea Lake.
This year, between the various household wastes and the remaining picnic activists, even daylight lamps were picked up that were left in the sands of the sea.
The transition participant and organizer Ulme say that people are directly responsible for pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decay stage, they are no longer identifiable, and for exhalers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches are also swimming pools in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrīva, an average of almost 800 waste units are collected every 100 metres, which are critical.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that every step is to be taken as well as a warning or a ban.
"The average numbers for all three Riga bathing places together - Daugavgrīva, Vakarbulīli and Vecāks - unfortunately are large and far ahead of the desired or target, as Latvia was moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes.
Cleaning the swimming pools in Riga every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the council Ugis Vidauskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We are going back to these people's cultural issues.
"For those ingested, alcohol is used, smoking and doing all things that are not allowed, even special signs are not involved," says Vidauskis.
Therefore, Vidauskis calls for bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps some new warnings can be put in place, but as I said, it will change the situation a little or a little.
"Since everyone must simply turn to each other and be impatient with such offenders together," he stresses.
Water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate for the fourth time this spring, which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, the quality of water is always good and satisfying.
The situation at present is that the quality of water in all 56 bathing places has always been good and there are no bathing restrictions.
"The last time we take the analysis at the end of August," says the senior environmental expert Norman Cadíķis.
Waste left on the ground during heavy rain may be disposed of in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotation in Russia's elite continues - the change in Putin's administration.
Do you miss your job?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov would abandon this post and will be the President's special representative for nature, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin dedicated himself to Ivanov in front of the television camera: "Dear Sergey Borisovič, we have worked with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with how you fulfill the duties entrusted to you.
I would like to recall our agreement not to use you as the head of this President's administration for more than four years.
That is why I will knowingly oppose your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in your new post you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is pointed out that the management of the President's administration is a very important role and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the National Councils are to be held in Russia next month, it has been said that this step is linked to the fight for power in Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also called the potential Vice-President of Putin, so the claim that he himself wanted to take office as President in matters of nature protection and transport raises doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the CEO and the General Manager of the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sensible and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his voyages in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
President Boris Jelcina was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanova's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the restoration of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, but in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the President's administration, Ivanov will also remain the seat of the Russian National Security Council, where the new President's administration manager will also work.
Guilt comes from the family council party.
Ivanov himself recommended the post of Head of the President's Administration.
Anton Eduardo and I have been known for a long time.
Ever since we worked in your government.
And in the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"That's why I'm convinced that according to all the professional and personal characteristics he's ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
Guilt comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet Party.
His grandfather Karl took high office in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary until 1988.
The Internet edition of "Meduza" with reference to the book "Self-determination and Independence of Estonia" writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to authorize the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he had been rejected and soon lost his job.
Shortly after that, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been rocked by several high-ranking officials and even arrested, including several local governors and federal representatives.
As politicians say, President Vladimir Putin reorganizes the ruling elite before the elections to be held in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing number of representatives of the structures in charge.
Niekiforenko also loses his juvie in the first match of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and the Latvian jujuxton has completed its participation in the Olympics at the end of the 17th place.
Coach Olžeg Baskin admitted to Latvia's TV that the hope of Nikiforenko was very low, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that a Jew had suffered a back injury in the battle.
Significantly, in order to reach the Olympic road map, Níkiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - i.e. in a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s pound weight was more than 20 pounds [25 kg].
It has been reported that Yevgenijs Borodavko fought in the weight category of up to 100 kilograms against Runnosuki for two minutes, until the opponent won a win worth a year.
Latvia has thus completed the judo race in Rio.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was given by Jewish Jewry Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more ambitious opponent, but at times he was able to achieve surprise.
He didn't lie.
Arthur Níkiforenko’s task was even more difficult because he was less experienced and also respected by the opponent.
The result is similar, even though he held tea half a minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvia's judiciaries recently lack the most ambition.
Since the federation's direction, Gunars ochres and his financial squad Vladimir Šestakovs have been on the side of the federation, taken from Latvia by Aleksandr Jackevicz, no longer takes place "Golden Score", - a judo development rhyming down the slope.
Jackevich, who consults with the Jews of Kazakhstan here, and Vsevold Zelóloni, does not see the heirs.
But if she doesn't grow up, there won't be.
And it's the Federation's prerogative.
Because from another galaxy, the Latvian Judo Federation's President's promise to stamp out the medals was scanned by the "Morta panoramic" of the "Ríta" galaxy.
Flight away from reality.
In the evening with impatience and concerns we waited for the beach volleyball cat Samoilovs/Schmediņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers have finished the games.
The Latvian duet had a slight deviation - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The momentum was even increased in the past game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card worm all over the game.
To the players, the brass wind caused additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be ours - which is the most comprehensive - to be shared.
But he didn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
He serves so much for Samoilov and waits for him to break up.
Against Canada, it broke down against Cuba at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not a joke.
The Sabbath could have been fished at that time because there was little work to do, but when there was, it was done in honor.
Brazil’s Samilov and Shemédin were able to win in two sets because the first took over with 16:15, but on 16 it also remained, also evaporating the lost points.
But he could also lose with 0:2 because the second set of deficits was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third is already in the way of Evandra's server.
The chain was formed - an unconvinced servant, the second play often flew too close to the network and Samilov remained quite low for the effective attack.
If there was some foreign Samoilov in the area, this time he worked more successfully, and only his loss would be unprofessional.
Kreil was wrong too, and quite symbolically, that the last bomb block hit exactly him.
The team's missing.
This time there was definitely also a lack of success - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the bomb hits the line.
The two tracks were next to the line.
The controversial episode also made a video for the benefit of opposers.
If in the first two games Evandra was taught by servers, then they were very productive against us.
All amounted to loss on the table.
The causes of the failure should now be peacefully analysed.
It may have been necessary for many to live next to the stadium, not along with the delegation to the Olympic village.
It's been two and a half hours on the way.
Perhaps a little self-confidential was given a series of seven semifinals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but rather come here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding the surface of the sport form.
We're waiting for more questions than answers.
The games are over for our cowards.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left, as well as Jūrmala's Masters.
Shame on Samoil’s life has never been friends and will never be, because there are too many different personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When a dream of the Olympic medals is broken, there may also be a thought of separation, for the blame will be sought not only for itself but also for the partner.
It is not difficult to resolve, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a good partner.
Both brothers are playing the game of bull, but John and Tom have tried and have also split, while Mihail Samoilov is still too green to start picking up the world’s surface.
You can try Harald Reggio, Alexander Solove, Edgar Tochus, to return to Martin Plymouth, but it will not be better than this option, which did not even prove itself in the stages of the World Cup.
This time, they were not mocked by the snow of Kopacaba.
And of course.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that the beach volleyball is becoming more popular, a new pair is in circulation, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This is still not a success, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
We're not staying longer.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to compete in the venues offered by the game managers, as well as to choose their own.
A selection of US basketball lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Some of the beach volleyballists have also found a hotel in Kopacaba.
This time, highly overplayed prices were required for journalists to offer all suitable overnight accommodation.
Therefore, the choice was also made for the rent of the apartment.
Risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from the point of view of logic.
This time, the risk is justified.
With Vladimir Vladimir Vladimirovich's rental apartments on the borders of Kopaban and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 metres away, a half an hour's walk from the arena.
The area is pretty safe, because the favela is flat, yet wisdom must not be lost here.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately think, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. It seems that on Friday morning another dream of medals was dreamed.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidina withdrew from her personal records in the 100-metre barrier and lift.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgies and Besa" sings in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgies and Besa" was first studied in the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised head has not been brought back.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to provide listeners with the opportunity to enjoy George Görsvin's masterpiece.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera study, this great George Gerswina's version of the concert studio "Porgey and Besa" opera is enjoyed by us in the new, newly opened concert hall "The Great Dintar", says the concert hall "The Great Dintar" by Baiba Goddes.
Opera "Porgies and Besa" is a story about love, its instability, its rage, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
This lack of political correction in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep," says the director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera - is always such stop points - the famous melodies, the famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to the other, by lighting one person or another person or choir or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera evaluates the musical director and conductor Andris Poga of the opera "Porges and Besa" concert studio.
Opera visitors are unanimous that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear the famous Gērsvina opera in this world.
Happy is that in Liepaja you can feel the spirit of the world.
"Performance Professional", the opera is rated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special in that in the newly opened concert hall "The Great Engineer" played the orchestra for the first time in the orchestra and for the first time the opera concert took place.
The site at the Museum of Art could be named after Jana Rosental.
Riga Foreign Minister Andris of the United States at the opening of the 27th anniversary exhibition said that the museum's own address in the future could not be Krisian Valdemar Street 10a, but Jana Rosental's field 1.
The museum director, Māra Láce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a severe bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
The base stone of the city of Riga has been laid on this idea in 1936, creating the monument of Burcarda Jeanna to Jani Rozentalium, which is located near the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvītis, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I don't think I'm going to have a heart attack all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitt, where are we going to put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, swear to think," said Lace.
It was reported that the National Museum of Art was officially viewing its doors after extensive reconstruction and modernisation this May.
This week will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle.
SIA "Velve" has been restored totalling around 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several castle spaces, including two viewers’ halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with movement disorders.
The Riga Council has planned to attract EUR 6 million from the European Union funds project, but the Director of the Riga Council's Property Department, Olīgs Burovs, recognises that there is still no full clarity for the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political desire to start the work of the VEF Cultural Pillar by attracting European Structural Funds, it is, we wait months for a decision, real action by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be allocated money," says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission saying that you would decide for yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see another round of discussions taking place, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that Riga's idea without doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed in time," says Burov.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Castle collectively organized a funeral concert before immediately, immediately expected renovations of the building.
Although last year, the renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under inadequate conditions.
In the strategy of the Department of Property of Riga, the renovation of the VEF Cultural Castle is divided into apparently independent reconstruction teams where each will ensure the implementation of different castle functions.
First - Increased access to the cultural castle of VEF and improvement of the surrounding area.
It provides for the organisation of environments and engineering communications, as well as the restoration of the façade of the building.
Second - Improving the supply of services in the cultural castle of VEF.
It plans to improve the interior, walls and ceiling restorations, theatre and sound records of the study, as well as to arrange the building's internal engineering communications.
Third - Improving creative collective working conditions for amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the "Līvu" 40th anniversary, the legendary handcuff can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various "Livus" items - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010, when the group's end is announced.
Participants' theatre clothes, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen to the general public, which reflected the creative activities of the "Live" group.
The exhibition will be complemented by the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual representation of the exhibition was only in cooperation with fashion artist and artist Elita Patmalnieci.
The musicians who were associated with the "Live" group and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The "Līvu" was first sought in 1972 when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitol was established in the Liepaja culture house.
The assembly took part in its initial composition at the "Liepājas dintars" festival in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic views.
In 1976, when Juris Pavitol met with Erika Kyigeli and a group was formed in the castle of Metallurgy, calling for the accession of Ingrid Gutmani, Andri Krūzini and Jani Groduma.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been felt at all times.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian hand music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What is missing - jeans, matinees and bardains, these boys are quite different from the generally accepted stereotype of the performance," says music viewer Klaas Våvere.
In the group without the above-mentioned musicians such as Igo, Vilnius Krievīņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Starks, Laumis Racenēks, Teleis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
Entry into the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition will be held from 19 August to 30 October.
In contrast, on August 27, Liepaja concert garden "Put, winds" will take place in the group "Līvi" 40-year anniversary festival "LIVIfest 2".

Zbignev Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is on the way.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Zbignev Stankevičs, in an interview with the Independent, stresses that if we want to gain life, the message of the Gospel must be at its heart.
For the power of the truth is greater than the power of wickedness.
Many are already on their way to the celebration of the Most Holy New Mary in the heavens of Aglon.
What message will the faithful receive this year?
In recent years, the pope has expressed his desire to lead the main service in Aglon.
Therefore, the main message is in his eyes.
For its kind of tradition to extend also the fact that the Crusader John Bulis leads the way.
He will also make his own message.
On the previous day, I conducted the worship of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
Last year I turned to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house in it, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying in my speech to respond to it.
My approach was consistent with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be kept in the center of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of human life and inspires him to go further.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cesius, in the discussion of the Lamp, you said that "you must return to the understanding of the whole human being."
What do you understand about that?
Does this mean that people are turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a resource today?
A man dying on the side of a road in the capital of India.
No one in the capital of India has left a message about a man dying on the road - it turns out he's been on the road for an hour and then he's still on the way, informs the BBC.
It has been reported that a man identified as Matibül had a day - to - day ride with a horse but worked as a guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning, go home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The recording of the surveillance cameras shows that the driver stepped out of the car to see the victim and then left.
An hour later, when no one knew about the bleeding man, she was beheaded by a mob.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived and the victim was transferred to the hospital where he died of the injuries.
By withdrawing his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koļgova, head of the State Environment Service, saved the government from falling, Professor Ojars Skudra of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia is considered.
The Collegiate explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in relation to the opposing coalition is related to the fact that it has prevented the collapse of the government.
In Skudra's conversation with the agency, LETA said that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting, "Unity" would support the candidacy of Collegiate.
Therefore, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Kologov was thus approved, it would lead to a government resignation.
The expert also considers that, prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Koļgova has consulted both Finance Ministers Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also an accession to the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether the competition will succeed with the help of an appropriate candidate, Skudra recognised that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to lead Dace Pelėk as the CEO.
At the same time, he points out - if the finance minister has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being examined, it is the home of Pelekka, that he should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the National Environment Service, Kolīgova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy as Director-General of the VID.
As a result of the "unity" objection, the government continued to approve Collegiate on Tuesday for a week as Director-General of the VID.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Koļgova testified that he was still ready to become the leader of the VID.
However, later on she changed her mind - in a presentation to the Finance Minister on Friday for Dani Reizniece-Ozoli, she points out that she is withdrawing her consent to move to the VID leadership and that this is not an easy choice for her.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska Press Secretary Andrejs Vavars explained to the agency LETA that a new competition would be held on the job of VID Director General.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A road accident involving a State police car took place in the centre of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on to the highest class call until Krishnia Barona and Djirnava hit another car on the street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force has not run along the police car.
In an accident, a woman suffered.
This year there is a decline in the population in Riga
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 inhabitants in Riga who were 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
On the other hand, the number of people living in Latvia's capital is 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to data from the EU Statistics Office, Eurostat is the largest female figure in Riga - the capital of Latvia is in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, the highest proportion of women in the largest cities in Europe is 123 in Vilnius, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
A warning icon will be located at the LNMM.
In the coming days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) there will be warning signs - pictograms, LETA told the agency Riga City Council representative Baiba Gailite.
The museum's repair of glass-based quick damage has now been successfully completed, resulting from the operation of the safety board.
Warning pictograms will be placed next to them in the next few days.
It will tell its inhabitants that the roof is usually snowy and snowy, so it must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, skates and skates.
On that social network, Facebook was also written by Usakov, who pointed out that no security threats were caused by the damage, but "seemed inaccuracy", and the seigneurs "come to know".
Celebrations for children and parents – New children’s playgrounds are installed in Riga.
This summer, the Riga municipality has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čiekurkalna, which are now available to children.
A large, multifunctional toy ship with various bathing elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski lifts is installed on the island beach.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The field also includes columns and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small ships is overshadowing the attraction position on the Daugava coast with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
On the other hand, the playing field between Čiekurkalna 4 and 5 is equipped with a game home, a boot, a degree path, a balance bridge, a pole, a toy bomb and other elements of the game, as well as a rounding area with force and coordination exercises, as well as sports elements.
Below the field is a rubber coating in different colors.
A new, colorful toy cover has been inserted on the side of the street to the playground.
Reconstructed road phase opened in Medjugorje.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of the Latvian State Roads (LVC) as well as the representatives of the construction companies SIA Binders and municipal authorities today discovered the Russian Main Road Limit (Grebņeva) -Rezekne-Dauavpils-Lietuvas border (Medumi) (A13) phase from Meduma to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 km).
Roads are a national road map, especially border roads, so special pleasure is to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the state's main roads thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As predicted, the resources available for roads during this planning period will be available in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most heavily laden roads in very good quality, as well as ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without the funding of the European Union," said Uldis Lugulis, reversing the symbolic strip.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction in the phase from Meduma to the border of Lithuania (156.4-163.05 km) SIA Binders started last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road is fully refurbished and the next year will begin repair work from Meduma to Daugavpilij itself, and the whole road will be arranged from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilij," informed the president of the LVC Board of Directors Jānis Lange.
The main roads of the country are the most heavily burdened and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by providing periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to replace the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals made by the expert group for the organisation of the road financing system," Lange noted.
Road connections and lighting in the Medjugorje Centre are arranged within the framework of the project.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages, a large amount of irrigation and extensive construction, a balanced long-term profile, which has so far been very uneven.
Refurbishment of public transport facilities and refurbishment of public transport.
Before the road there was insufficient instability and the area relief was not transparent due to the mountain valleys and the old road to the total relief.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road phase from the border of Daugavpils City to the stage currently rebuilt (144,80,156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to do various types of work more than 1,100 kilometres of national road.
All repairs planned on the national road network this year are available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight loss, it is very important to choose the right choice of food combinations," acknowledges Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
Moreover, it is easy to accomplish during the summer season when fresh fruits, sheep, and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of foods of mind can help not only to reduce excess weight but also to promote the various processes of the body.
Macaroni and etiqueur are a successful combination because it provides a long-lasting sense of saline and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that etiquette has a positive effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel the lips.
Cayenne peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, not only makes you feel sad, but also reduces your appetite for large meals in the next few meals.
The combination of such foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after the meal to up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Kayenne’s peppers can help to get rid of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolic nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels, thus also accumulation of fat around the body’s middle.
The egg yoghurt, accompanied by fresh berries, has another guard and a fat burning meal for breakfasts that are worth included in your menu.
Oats and berries contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the gland - an appetite stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, sheep contain polyphenols that are helpful in weight loss and do not allow fat to be formed.
Plants and proteins can also perform miracles in weight loss.
Such a combination can create a feeling of silk.
The vegetables contain water and fibers, which contribute to the feeling of silk.
At the same time, protein slows the digestion process and provides a sense of silk for a longer time.
During lunch, you can eat pasta with salads or prepare a protein cocktail from a ready mix and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any product combinations.
In fruits there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit splits mechanically into the stomach, but they do not split chemically until they reach the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that takes place in the intestine.
The starch splits into three different stages that already begin in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat a sweet meal immediately after the meal.
Eating a sweet meal immediately after a meal, it is "simplified" in the stomach along with other foods where it is not chemically digested and begins to boil.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, cereals, bananas, dice or other carbohydrate products with lemons, jams, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is present in the silica, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only carbohydrate digestion but also facilitate their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheeses and eggs or cheeses and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and protein-like combinations of rich products at one meal.
They require different digestion juices, each with different strength, characteristics and time when to get into the stomach.
Arbus, honeymelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not crushed if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with solids, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats inhibit protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein products is consumed, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contained proteins) with whole avocados (contained fats).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to prepare?
"Preparation of food, thermal treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of products," says the dietologist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste by cooking food in water.
However, the value of some foods increases, directly by cooking.
After cooking vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, including by steaming them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene containing tomatoes.
When you eat tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burkina Faso, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
The thermal treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while the freezing of the fibre does not affect it.
Dolls in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bloody iron found in plant products such as beans, leaves, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and oats.
You can significantly increase non-bloody iron absorption in the body by using non-bloody iron products with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps change non-blooded iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures oxygen supply in the muscles and brains.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing buttermeas with salmon, add vitamin D to rich salmon or to sardines without added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other full grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, rivers, rivers and other fruits or eggs help to stabilise cholesterol levels, as well as avoid arterial paralysis.
Snapchat Anime criticises the effect of Asian labelling
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistally insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in a completely absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog, or image that would fit into the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
The funds are misty, image distortion instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised by getting the impression that the application popularizes too black or light face tones as an ideal for beauty.
This week, the new lens effects were published, allowing users to create eyelashes, brush teeth and round cheeks, and some critics referred to it as racist Asian cartoons as "golden family".
The question was also raised whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials broke out on Wednesday, when the publications of The Verge and Motherboard said that the lens effects were removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens was to paint pictures of Anime, not to carve people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have reminded them of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically rejected the comparison with Anime.
In an e-mail, she states that the lens effects are "excusable and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult to ignore the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and mouse effects.
This shows that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural pages.
American culture is also involved in an inexhaustible fight for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat a large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things remain undetected", 25-year-old Keithia Zhou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of Medium Žou will delete his Snapchat application and advise others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in her phone interview she explained that she believed that racial problems were due to Snapchat's employment policy, which did not support racial diversity enough.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether there are some other racial representatives working in the company, but they do not assume the role of safe and comfortable expressing their views," says Chinese American Zhou.
She also agreed with others, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not disclose the number of employees of different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative discovered that the company had hired a staff expert who would focus on representing also ethnic minorities who were not widely represented and would promote their participation in the company.
In turn, Zhou will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "It is interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The House of Congress reports that military officials have corrupted reports about the Islamic State.
On Thursday, the House of Congress stated that the representatives of the U.S. Central Order had distorted the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it really is.
Analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the Task Force of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on the Financing of the Republics of the Republics set up by the Task Force, indicating that their management controlled reports on the success of the Americans in the fight against the Islamic State.
The central command known as Centcom is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which supervises US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest information on this report is reported that the intelligence reports approved by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than it really is. The facts have been regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
The representative of the Republicans of California, Ken Calverts, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are being sought at the highest level of management.
This 10-page long report details the problems that exist in the Central Order's reflection and analysis of the American efforts to prepare Iraq's forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide conclusive evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration have had to falsify the reports, it shows that Centcom's management has put some pressure on analysts to paint a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report states that in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Releases, Communications and Reports presented to Congress a much more positive situation in the light than it was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is Iraq’s second largest city, still under Islamic control.
The representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in his report, said: "The investigation of several months clearly proves this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US central management chief officials have distorted the reports, depicting the threat of ISIS in Iraq weaker than they were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to know that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic country is being distorted.
For further investigation, the report published on Thursday will follow new findings in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party of the Administrative Committee of Inquiry published their own report in which they agreed to some of the conclusions of the Working Party of the Republican Party.
In his report, Democratic Representative Adams B. Shifs reported that from 2014 to 2015 Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence evaluation reports related to the ISIS and Iraq Security Forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", aggravated the ethics of analysts and "distributed the facts that do not fit the truth."
But Shifs and the members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that White Nams has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to the "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published on Thursday the provisional results of the Congress investigation.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate initiated an investigation into Centcom’s analytical complaints.
The representative of the Pentagon, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence called for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation does not merely concern the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely fully on the Central Management reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of the Islamic State's exploration recalls more than ten years ago events when Centcom's investigator Gregory Hücker published a study claiming that George V. Bush's administration began the war in Afghanistan, too little considering its possible consequences.
Hücker also played an important role in discovering the question of Islamic state exploration.
Last year, officials reported that the Hücker team found that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic State Oil Plants had not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not come outside the Central Management walls.
At that time, Commander General Lloyd Ostin III received an ace criticism, as many lawmakers felt that war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Ostinus took his leave and replaced General Joseph L. Votel.
In the US duel with UK women in the field hockey, the US wins, thus winning the fourth in a row.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama won the first two doors of the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
Five gate wins in two games are unforgettable achievements, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember if she had ever succeeded.
She said, "I don't have feelings."
I'm not one of those people who is counting on their own gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group an inseparable with the United Kingdom, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with the result of 2:0 remained undefeated.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last game in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which one.
The first winner will avoid meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group for a little longer.
Despite the fact that Saturday’s game was not coming to an end, the Americans have already triggered a surprise storm four years ago, taking the last place among the 12 teams in London.
There was also Bama on that team
She grew up in Blubel, she was the first to have a field hockey game at the age of 3 years (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a selection in the history of the latest players.
She did not attend the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the finals.
In 2012, however, she and her team failed.
The following year, Craig Parham was appointed as a selection coach and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
In London we didn't do as much work as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
In the Thursday game Bama discovered the result by winning the doors in the first half-hour with a backdrop from the distance.
Indian games started without victory in their account, but their selection was very lively and kept the minimum result 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama again got the doors.
She introduced the ball opponent zone to the left of the field, and then she noticed going to the middle of the field and spreading the ball opponent's gates, putting in the direction of the Americans 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales had another door.
This was the first game of the U.S. Warehouse Jackies Brig, in each of the first three games by entering one gate.
She's fallen asleep.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but just as well, the game will show Saturday.
The most instructive meal of the period of depression is "Satful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election president, Franklin Delano Ruszvelt sat in the oval room to hold meals.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary desserts, such as the Zosus liver paste or the fuagar and Merilland brown soup.
At that time, however, her meal was much more sufficient: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato beespouse and dessert - a puddle of flowers.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity with people who had a very hard time preparing meals."
Her husband, Andrey Kou, adds: "It's also a message for Americans to eat."
The couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou’s last book, The Garden of Delight, describes the Chinese kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane describes life in his book “97 Abeles” through a food rental house in Manhattan’s eastern lower part.
Their new joint work "Satītių meal," published on Tuesday by Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinary, they held meals together with reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch restaurant located in the Flatiron area and operating since 1929 when great depression began.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered butter with roasted cheese and minced olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered tomato, potato beet and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake hook, the couple recognized that his choice was very suitable for the discussion of the Great Depression Meal.
Ms. Ziegelmanes told me that the fake trick was very popular.
There was an earthquake, a liver, and a bean.
They were prepared from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they're in the middle of noon.
Mr. Kou's new.
"I'm sure the stomach is full of lead," he added.
In pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men-workers and lunches, lunches and dinners were served freshly prepared sausages.
During World War I, Americans sent food directly to Europeans. "Satīti" described how Americans adapted to conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of overcrowding.
"Then the food became the main object of the American people's daily attention," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on this subject.
Just as important were the new budget diets: unknown foods such as fake sausage and sausages became everyday, the sausages were "a great way to use surpluses," said Ms. Ziegelmane, as the ingredients could be hidden under a creamy measure.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the main ingredient of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, sex, new, unseen creatures.
In an ancient diary, Mrs. Ziegelmanes found recipes for the preparation of potatoes filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch supplement."
Mrs Ziegelmane said, "It was sireal."
Butter of peanuts and peptus syrup are incompatible.
Many household meals were used in difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Economics from 1923 to 1943, established national eating habits that were not experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economies" and to accept challenges such as turning the macarone and burkan mix into a tasty meal.
"Satīti" is a historical treat.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hüver's "let me eat corn" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Esau’s home, he was actually eating as a fine millionaire for whom he had become.
Mr. Kou says, "He liked the European cuisine, such as fish with carrots."
He ate in the almost reddish living room, wearing lunch jackets.
He was completely out of reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to show an example of his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt rejected a house servant who was not ready to eat, thus the White House became "a place where not only one of the worst meals was served in Washington, but also the worst prepared meals".
As soon as the national economy recovers, most of the normal culinary consumption of the depressed era has disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as to how science is used in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
A couple reported that in writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanes said, "She actually fucked people."
Sometimes there was an incident with windmills.
When we ate in Eisenberg’s dining hall, a couple of writers pulled out of the bag a prepared desert: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat in lunch.
"It is plumbing," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time there was a widespread custom for sufficient food to give this name.
It does not contain dust, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and canal.
All were impatiently laden with brown carrots that were on the solution.
Amazingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou is eating some more comos.
Listening to an experienced "economist," he said to his wife, "Derred strawberry nuts."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in combating Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The District Justice has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." is entitled to recover the costs of legal services which it has paid in the case of the termination of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company "Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was acquitted of 200 million pounds of fines for two Merck patent breakers that threatened her with successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when the U.S. federal judge found violations in Mark’s activities, such as lying after a promised transfer and other non-ethical actions.
On Thursday, U.S. district judge Beth Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred in defending this case.
Merck is trying to obtain a position on the market for Gilead, which is dominant on the market with the new generation of hepatitis C, which is effective in 90% of the cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013 when Gilead and Merck accused each other of trying to obtain ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicines.
The U.S. supported forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbiz from the Islamic State.
The US-backed forces have fully taken control of Manbiz cities in the northern part of the state of Turkey border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city of the last combatants who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civil citizens who had been captured by fighters, Reuters told the news agency Sharfan Darvis from the Manbidž military council of the SDS.
"Now the city is completely under our control and we are searching for fighters," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published a 2015 tax statement showing that the Democratic Party President and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million, mainly to its Clinton charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, acting as a speaker and former Secretary of State received $3 million from his book on State Department work published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election public - U.S. senator Tim Kein and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax statement for the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hylaria Clintone and Tim Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," said Jennifer Palmieri, a client of Clinton's campaign.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various instigations and omissions in order not to fulfill the promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a practice for the US President's candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers refer to the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter post, told Clinton's campaign partner, Ian Sams, about the tax information of the Democratic Party candidate.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Trappam to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trampa critics, including the candidate for the 2012 president of the Republican Party, Mits Romnia and other Republicans, argue that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, contributions and other business obligations, including obligations with Russia.
Clinton poured oil on the fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans demand Tramp to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue during her economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She said to the effort: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
"Politico" reported that during the 1990s, Tramps had paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday the business column "New York Times" reported that many booksellers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the Varena Bafet's proposal, popularises the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate, Bafets invited Tramp to exchange tax returns.
Bafet said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clinton now lives in Chapakva, New York and has paid the average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and the total tax rate of around 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin for the closure of the Israeli telephony code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of the Jewish French films of origin raised wind in the social media, when he discovered that the hotel "Kempinski Bristol" in Berlin is not available an Israeli telephony code. Hotel staff base it on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, a documentary film about the Holocaust director Shoah, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find a list of Israel’s remote phone codes.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was destroyed and destroyed?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "has shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "it has been a well-known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more evident in the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabic and they requested the deletion of Israel's code," Lancman quoted the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, has referred to this case as "a large bone".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same is true of yourself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, precisely in this hotel network there is even greater humiliation.
No explanation is required.
The official said, "We hope the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply issued to Arab customers.
Another entry said, "Scream," indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the riots, saying that it was all "understanding" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And it adds that the code has been added back to the list.
Police use rubber and tear gas against Protestant Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul in Brazil, where students gathered in demonstrations against government education reform.
The police used rubber balls and tear gas against the students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to wipe out students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to show their distrust of the reform of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmina of Sanpaul aims to close almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be moved to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations to express support for the deposed President Dilma Rosefai, for whom the Senate voted in favour.
Scott Kelums Skinner finished first, bringing to Great Britain gold medals on the bike
Kelums Skinners from Scotland finished the first race of the Men’s Riding Team in the race in Rio, which took place last night. The British team protected its championship title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these competitions, making the proud legendary Scotch Ser Kris Hoy and winning the New Zealand favourites.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprising victory when Hoys scored the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did so again at the World Championship in London, even though Hoys had already finished his sports career.
The problems were at the stage of the Beijing-London Olympics, as experienced start-up specialists James Staffe had to be replaced.
They made it at the last minute.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill out Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The British coaches hoped for Skinner, looking forward to the potential he later proved.
Hindus, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoyo and Skinner, who set the Olympic Qualifications Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus, after their roundabout, were narrow - minded, Kenyan took the lead, and Skinner protected it.
The change of strategy played an important role in winning, as Hindus drove with a larger transport to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys observed the competition as a BBC representative and caught sights of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindu eyes when they were staring at an honored pedestrian.
The 23-year-old singer said, "It was an indescribable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
At the end, we installed the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoyo in the 2012 London Olympics, Hindus admitted that they were willing to fall on the track after a failed start.
Later, he reiterated this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove otherwise.
There was no such incident this time.
Hindus said, "The British flags in the Tribes have recalled London."
Over the last 3 months, we've become a team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the Olympics were really special.
One medal will be awarded to a country that won seven of the ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this is a performance indicator of team progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s results, he could indeed repeat Hoya’s success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
In addition, Kenya was born on 23 March (it appears to be the holy date of the British, because Stephen Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters were born on this day).
Hoys was born on this date.
Kenya’s next race is a sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win along with the team members.
If honest, then winning one is a little lonely."
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed a soldier."
It was the only battle for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Vigins, Eds Clancy, Steve Burke, and Owen Doul presented the fastest qualifying time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today on the second side of the day, where Vigins will certainly be in the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualification trip, he had disagreements with the commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey that will continue and be completed today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsel Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibald from Milgavia set a new record time of 4:13.360.
The UK delegation hopes that the British Rising Team will be in the middle of the Olympics, hoping for a medal.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone looks forward to the same achievements as Rio.
While behind the scenes has been different, after charges of sexism and respect, technical director Sheins Saton has resigned, and Hoys and Victoria Bendleton also finish their career.
However, starting with the first race of velodrom, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland warehouse becomes unclear as a vast contract has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium boilers and hundreds of its employees in Portland has become unclear in Victoria, as its main customer announced the ceasefire.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to stop the subsidisation of the energy company, which is vitally important for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grant will be suspended in November.
Thus, more than 2000 Alko Portland's jobs are at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk, both direct and indirect.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects, as it consumes about 10 per cent of all Victorian electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry plant, which led to a break-up of the English power station.
Alkoa Portland's warehouse works with losses and can be closed.
These events resulted in years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The industrial energy supplier "AGL", who supplies energy from his Loy Yang A power station in Latroubas Ilea, says that the other three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most power stations belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, as well as parts of the company belong to the Chinese holding companies "CITIC" and "Marubeni Corp" in Japan.
"AGL" hopes for the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further supply of energy to the mining plant," said its representative.
AGL reported that the contracts are so-called "risk-restrictive contracts" that are intended to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
As from the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profit is limited to favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
"AGL" claims that its forecasts have already calculated losses of $187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa reports that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the operation of the boiler or to supply energy to it.
The US company reported that it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang in 2010 for 20 years, but will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation for why it will cease its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland plant in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
AGL Executive Director Stevens Michelson said last week that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts were spent during the year of Portland by analysts.
If both of these plants left the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be all right.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 people's demands are rejected, and, in addition, by reducing the budget, the situation could deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal expulsion are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far.
The Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, James Farels, said that the latest report of the Association of National Legal Centres reported that legal assistance is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr. Farels pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: "The Queenland Legal Centre is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that assistance is denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who experience divorce, workers who are unjustly released - all of these people have problems of a legal nature, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop funding immediately so that people in need of legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to pay attention also to the needs of local communities and their clients and to the Palazčuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trampa's campaign was prosecuted in court because one of the employees was fired by a fireman
New York: The organizers of the Donald Trampa campaign are charged in court because they have not acted upon the information that their North Carolina Operation Commander turned firearms against an employee when they drove in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court order filed on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini - the former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had waited for months to begin an internal examination of the case, but realized that it would not happen.
The leader Earl Philips "drawed his gun, put his right index finger on the floor and turned the pillar against Vincent's roadside", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by filing complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Weapons don't have to be shot to cause losses," Bordini reported in his complaint.
Only two days before this case was filed, the candidate of the Republican party to the presidential office caused the scandal by telling people that "The Second Amendment people", i.e. the owners and enthusiasts of the weapons, could act if his election would win his competition Hilaria Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the trampa campaign announced that the media had broken his words out of context, and he never kissed anyone for violence.
Bordini wants to receive compensation from campaign organizers for neglecting supervision, but from Filipsa - for assault, illegal use of weapons and for creating emotional stress.
Trampa's representative, Hope Hicks, did not comment immediately.
He couldn't get in touch with Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Donald Trumps, the candidate for the president of the Republican Party, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - village and sports festivals in the village of Kūlška.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for the holidays of the village and sports.
This time, after ten years of celebration, it was decided that there would be no more of Ezra’s festivals.
The new pages have now been changed.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, the shooting had to be put to sleep, the sawflies flew, with a human left-hand knife, the "bombing" was not at all in any Olympics.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, diligent, and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, all gathered in the play of the outdoors, where the parish festivals began.
At the time, there was also a "child drive", where the little one could emerge in the exciting attractions and get a new picture in the ceiling.
The news, which could also become a tradition, was a motorbike show, with tractors and motorcycles.
All were addressed by Inga Kadíķe-Skadiņa, the head of the municipality of Kūlštām, who wanted a nice rest and a dry time, but the rains dropped, but it was not able to interfere much.
Celebrations continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of the village.
Well, it's really good that the village has joined five girls and one boy.
The performances of the "Rudden rhythm" band of senior dancers, the performances of the various national dancers "Reds" and the performances of young dancers "Gelta Pearls" were very popular with the performances of the former dancers.
And it's nothing that any of those were going to slide on the backstage.
Of course, local people and neighbors were delighted by the famous actress Janis Jaran and Dainis Porgans, who were once again Mildini Nabinas and Clairte Kraninias, as well as the attractive women of Berzciem from the fishermen's "Days".
Balli played the Bruges group.
The United Kingdom must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand the Hithrova.
Vitrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitler very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we have invested enormously in order for all the national regions to benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Istanda won an extraordinary many of the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing locals and businesses with business opportunities close to Hitrov.
To the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add a point to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people this time who will believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitrov is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be the world’s end.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and in the case of Hitler, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hitrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the whole community, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is possible to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
He is working on a great team that has created an 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme, including in time and in the budget, starting with Terminal 5, which has been called the best terminal in the world for five years and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensive routes in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third track, which will be financed by private investments of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that will also be the enlargement of Hitrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Hitler by ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment for Britain to be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman arrives on the highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he dies on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses for an accident when, on Thursday morning, she was hit by several cars.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The Vo Canton police report said that in an attempt to commit suicide, the woman had become accustomed to the dark of the road where she had been hit by several cars.
Unmistakably trying to kill themselves, the victims, 49-year-old Swiss, assembled several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been identified, the police say, calling for the withdrawal of the drivers involved and the witness of the accident.
The case has also been initiated a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, according to lawyer Gilles Hofsteller of Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid confrontation?
The courtroom adds, "The prosecutor will find out."
Two similar events in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be called responsible.
In both cases, the walker had left the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a walker to be found in the middle of the night, a newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was executed for unconsciousness when in August 2014 she went to a man who slept in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijern.
The court found that the 22 - year - old was drunk and later noticed that he was asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on his way to the crash site drove in an appropriate manner and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was "an entirely unpredictable and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On-line signatures shall be collected for the appointment of a new VID leader.
The petition portal Avaaz.org launched the collection of signatures for the appointment of a new Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Associations (NA) and the Green and Agricultural Unions (ZZZS) states that the company wants a transparent and professional appointment process for officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Mr Ingas Koļegova as Director-General of the VID is transparent and non-professional.
This recalls the best traditions of the Council’s officials.
This discredits public administration and makes society hope for the government and politicians on a regular basis.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the petition text said.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the company does not know the criteria as Koļgova has chosen for the post.
Nor is it clear what candidates want to do in the work of the VID.
The petition states that a new open competition is to be created by the State Chancellor, which actively addresses professional candidates, attracts staff selection experts and offers appropriate remuneration.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed the head of the Kolegov VID last week, this week he was scheduled to be approved in the new post, but all the party ministers voted against, so the matter was postponed for a week.
Samilov: If we lost, then I played a bad game.
Pludmal volleyballists Alexander Samoilov and Janis Šmēdīņš hoped for the honour of Riodezaneiro in the Olympic Games, but, without reaching it, there was no difference where the competition ended, after leaving the tournament said Samoilov.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball couples in the final and decisive 1-2 tournament on Thursday (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalveš Oliver and Pedro Solberg Salgad, concluding their participation in the four major sports forum.
In the three subgroups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was still two couples.
The following was the ratio of three small points to each other, which was the most adverse to the Latvian duet after the loss of the strong.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 so we also stayed at 16 points", the game was remembered by Shmedīns.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remained pointless.
It must not be played.
After that, everything in the second set was in order, and the set finally succeeded in breaking the game, and it should have been a good foundation for the third set.
We started it the same way, but after we got together with the parties, the result grew only to one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
All the teams in the subgroup were similar, almost all the cats had three sets, so small points were important.
"I had to play a more similar game than giving back 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew that Evandra could be observed.
"In the first set we met at the end of it, in the second entry we introduced points 1-2, but in the third at +4 he already left the game," recalled Shmedijs.
We tried to show you the best game.
It's been a while, not a moment.
I did not see the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as little points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, then I played bad," Samoilov said.
We expected to serve well from Evandra, and with it we were doing quite well in the first set, but the third one opened up to him and it was difficult to build an attack.
I, on the other hand, made a lot of mistakes right at Pedro’s desk, but it had to be done.
Samoilovs told me that contrary to the previous match, sportsmen today were not nervous.
"We went, played, too, protection was, however, needed a better service," said the sportsman.
"They played well, and at the end of the day they were already on the "urra"".
Before the tournament, we said that the lot was the most uncomfortable it could be.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but we didn’t even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting a medal and we were also from ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future.
I don't think there will be a question and we'll continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilova Riodežaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, as in 2008 he started with Martin Plávini in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
For the time being, this was the second start at the Olympics.
Latvenergo also follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of the potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from both the consumer and the potential trader’s positions, said Press Secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether or not Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be set up."
"That's why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gáze", has developed a draft of the Cabinet rules on "Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing operating principles of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
While working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and as understandable as possible to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service option is chosen by the "marketer's central model", in which all activities relating to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one bill and one location for the provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
It is recalled that after 3 April 2017, household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to users at a regulated price is set for the public trader," the Ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trading agreement.
Prior to the conclusion of the natural gas trading agreement, traders will be allowed to trade in natural gas at a fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to and from users, the security requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gasified object owner, the rights and obligations for the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for the settlement of the services received, the amount of interest on delays, the exchange of traders and the supply of users in the event of disturbances in the supply of natural gas; the arrangements for the provision of natural gas to related users by the public trader.

Oil prices continue to fluctuate; exchange indices are increasing in the US and Europe as well as in the US dollar value.
Oil prices in the world continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investor attitudes on the statements made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil beneficiary countries will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached a record level on Thursday, which has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was an increase in the oil price and strong financial performance of several large companies.
The increase in the oil price and the strong financial performance of several companies also led to the rise of European stock exchange indices on Thursday.
The US dollar value increased on Thursday against the euro, against the UK pound and against Japan yen.
New York Stock Exchange's electronic trade in WTI brand's crude oil price for deliveries increased on Thursday by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel.

The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā laguna" was reduced by 33.8% earlier.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā laguna" was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros - according to the annual financial statement published in the Lursoft database.
The management report of the company stated that in 2015 the company was working on losses caused by several reasons, including the permanent shortage of trading assets caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by the termination of the pre-existing credit line and leaving the Blue Laundromat with the contracts concluded without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and to receive a discount.
The departure of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union Structural Funds support projects that would enable the plant to purchase new manufacturing equipment and modernise the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial creators in the previous year had a negative impact on the rise in raw materials prices and customers’ unwillingness to pay more than the company’s manufactured goods.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 did customers recognise price changes and were willing to buy goods for the new - highest - prices," company management said.
In 2015, "Zila Laguna" also started talks with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been with the company's largest Unicredit Leasing creditor, where the parties have been familiar with and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of equipment was purchased that ensures a higher production speed," said the company's management.
The management of the Blue Layout notes that the equipment acquired in 2016 will allow the company’s factory to comply with orders that have not yet been possible.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since intentional protocols have already been signed for the sale of the product, all the products will be sold in accordance with intentional protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 thousand euros per month," company management says.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish production supplies to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, he sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus, and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new US wholesale chain.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Zila Laguna" worked with 6,347 million euros in turnover and 5,113 million euros in losses.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and its capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirshon (10.89%).
Welcome to 15 p.m. at the museum to await the cinema live Zāra Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Rīga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the beautiful cinema of the career of Zāra Leander.
The village of Zāras Lendere near the crossroads of Ruth, a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was considered fatal in Riga in 1924, because she had just discovered an unusual low contrast to the woman of Zāras Lendere, who was trying to be charged to the theatre at the theatre in Riga.
Perhaps it was the random question in Riga that turned out to be a disastrous turn on Sarah’s creative path against the glory of the world.
Rīga Zārai Leanderei associated herself with warm memories, and she hoped to go to Riga’s gatherings, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because World War II had begun.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible for the 2016 Riga Festival and the excellent Zāra Leander will be part of the great Ieva Kerēvica.

Because of the neighborhood repair, the man is at the broken ceilings and is forced to leave home.
In the LTV broadcast "4.Study", Dmitry Saidjaševs, whose neighbor started the repair of the capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitri has been staying away from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out self - sacrificing construction and my apartment has damaged ceilings.
Then I informed the Riga Building Boards, the House Managers and other organizations.
The construction board said that we are not an operational service and that we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrys.
The invited expert arrived, fixed the incident and acknowledged that the cover was in an unsatisfactory position.
However, since Dmitry’s first submission, the building board has been in a month, and until the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether the apartment is life threatening.
The building board said - that's legislation, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to the Riga Council, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building manager, and then there's a steep path," says Dmitry.
After all, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although one can hear someone at a time working there.
During another two months, the owner of the apartment who works for repair must have completed an expert examination and during six months all these defects must have been removed.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether there is an impact on the metal structure in this non-ferrous structure, and therefore there is no doubt that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"That is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Zukka, representative of Riga City Building Authority.
Despite the ban on any repair at the top of the apartment, the building continues to be heard from inside.
The penalty for self-inflicted construction without building permits is between EUR 70 and 700, but in a particular case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert opinion is expected, the construction board has decided that both apartments must not be used - both in construction and in Dmitria.
"This is not the case in construction practices where, because of their ignorance or simply lack of will, citizens may have put the owner of the property at risk, as well as the owner of the property below, as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property," says a representative of the construction company.
Now Dmitri is staying at another place to live - with relatives, friends, hotels, or even renting another apartment.
But Dmitry’s loss may try to escape from a neighbor’s civil order, which can take a lot of time.
Because of arbitrary construction, both apartments are currently prohibited until the construction manager concludes, and it can be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage caused will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repair work took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because the construction board has not taken into account what it says.
Come on!

Former NATO commander Brídlova has been hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers, who hacked the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers, may have committed several other cyber attacks, also hacked former NATO commander Filip Brídlov's e-mail and George Soros' "Open Society" servers, on Thursday, a business news agency called Bloomberg.
The information received by hackers has been published on the website "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, there is a list of Brídlova and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute’s computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were committed by the same hackers who broke down DNC e-mails related to Russian experts.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the US President Barack Obama's administration is currently considering the issue of new sanctions for Russia, thus responding to the collapse of the DNA computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally charge the servers of the Democratic Party with hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities in a cyber attack.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system in July, from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the party's candidate, Hilaria Clinton, in the campaign of the former Sanders, a member of the Party of Vermont, in the fight for the nomination of the Democrats for the start of the presidential election.
According to U.S. press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which investigates the break-up of democratic servers, and other U.S. experts, believes that Russia's connection to the cyber attack is beyond doubt.
Markartney: Noko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartney acknowledged that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of the threat of the legendary band "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with John Lennon's niece, but at the time she went to visit the group to attend the study, she feared Makartnia because Ono was the only woman in the group between George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenon and Makartnia.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he answered to the magazine Rolling Stone, "They're really good."
At that time, we felt threatened.
As we entered, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not bear it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful, because we were very busy.
We weren’t sexists, but the girls usually didn’t come to the record study, and they let us work.
When John started dating Yoko, he didn't sit in the control room but in the middle of us.
The author of the film "Yellow Submarine" also acknowledged that he is now regularly communicating with the former band member Ringo, and regularly confirms the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" is "still working".
The question is whether he is still meeting the other still living member of the legendary handcuffs, Makartneys to the Rolling Stone magazine said, "Frequently no."
We meet in social events and ballets.
However, I did not attend the meetings, and I felt a little out of control.
I left Apple during a severe separation.
At my place of meeting, I sent John Einstein and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at his table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I will only listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has once been a inhabited planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
NASA Godard Space Research Institute scientists have developed a model to explore Venus history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, which is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost only of carbon, once the Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have already mentioned that Venus' slow rate of rotation is explained by the deep atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plan, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's oldest topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to create life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was about 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus turnout model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained in the press release by GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a thing that, in turn, forms layers of thick clouds that act as rain protection by protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually some degree lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus was subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation over several billion years.
Its oceans burst out, and the moons were set on fire by ultraviolet rays.
When the water was fully drained, only the plane's carbon atmosphere remained with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Royce resigns from the "Avalanche" coach's position
On Thursday, Colorado 'Avalanche' coach and hockey operations Vice-President Patrick Roy made a motion for an exemption, as a reason for mentioning the insufficient impact of the team's decision-making process.
The Colorado Vice President and General Manager Joe Sakiks confirmed the news and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetically, curiously and objectively performing my duties as the main coach and vice president of the Colorado Club hockey operations," writes 50-year-old Roys in his statement.
During this summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it what it needs and achieve a higher level of performance.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the Vice-President of the coach and hockey operation must fully coincide with the visions of the organisation.
It should also have the possibility to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakiks, who committed to Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Said Patrick informed her of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the good of the organization, and we want it all to be better for him further.
In his first season with the "Avalanche" team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach in the league and received Jack Adams' prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round the Colorado team won the Minnesota hockey team. Since then, the club has not been in the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team, not obtaining the second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
In his career, the guard of the famous hall Roys fired four Stanley's balls - two with Montreal's "Canadian" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
Workers' strikes on the remuneration of North Sea oil platforms workers have been delayed because the two parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the heads of the news negotiations.
Periodically against the Oil Processing Company, Wood Group is operated by strikers on the North Sea oil platforms where Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The Joint Communication states that Wood Group and Unity and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin in the coming week with a view to re-examine problem issues.
The trade unions reported that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at a 30 per cent reduction in the proposed wage.
Due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group this year reduced the salaries of North Sea workers by 9 per cent.
By 2014, the company had already reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company makes it clear that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market declines.
Shell has already reduced salaries for several thousand people and has announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize their work in the preparation of a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies feel pressured by oil prices, and the situation is becoming more difficult for the UK to abandon the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Mr Anderson, Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the Northern Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is of vital importance to the economy of the region.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy from which everyone, not individual, would benefit.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are planned to invest nearly $1.4 billion compared to the $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of star rotation in Pleiades.
The newest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalog of star rotation speed in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars are spinning at different speeds in this star, as well as how the speed of star rotation is applied to planet formation.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system," said Luis Rebula, scientist at the Pasadenas Caltech Infrared Process and the Analytical Centre.
The Pleiades Star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They're turning at the maximum speed.
Turning at the maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star winds.
As they enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars grow older, their rate of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by determining the time between a recognizable star area, such as the solar plane, appearance.
The latest speed of star rotation shows that larger star rotations are slower than smaller stars.
The rebel compares stars to dancers, higher growth dancers do pyruets slower than small growth dancers.
Rebuls says that the "ballet" of Pleiades shows that slow rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the closeness of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory where stars can be compared to speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both parents and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about when and why the speed of star rotation is slowing down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the speed of rotation of Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
