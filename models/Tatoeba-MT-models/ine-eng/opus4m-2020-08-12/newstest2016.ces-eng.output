At the emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend
During an emergency call with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and needed them to come home.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was at home alive and probably upset, and that contacts to the family of a dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss' body and handwritten message on the white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," she said in a letter signed by Lamb by the authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where the police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb must have made a fatal phone call on the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school was shot, the students and the faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, and the authorities are still trying to monitor Lamb's motivation.
Details published by investigators on the state side and by students and employees who knew him together created a picture of a talented but probably a problem teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no record of the criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote to thank the great people with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with the other 17th members of the Faculty, and many students attended classes at both of them at once.
At the same time, there has been a tendency toward problems.
A student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and upset, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had already asked Delta State University for freedom for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes regarding the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked hard would not give him an automatic functional period to become an assistant professor.
The president of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb must have suffered something."
Lamb won't answer these questions anymore.
After he left campus, the police caught his mark when he crossed the Arkansas state border back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only gun shot in the courtroom about a mile from his parents in Greenville suburb of Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the state of Washington, Methel Johnson.
The car's been running down the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this place.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He won a doctorate in education in spring.
One of Lamb's long-standing friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said that she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends at high school, and he was the great elder boy who taught her to play guitar for a few years.
It was quite a pain in the heart back then.
The heart of all the girls fluttered as soon as it appeared," claims Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be walking for a while.
During the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house next to the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely disappointed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend she ever had with her mother.
Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail knew Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail were performing at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a rather enlightened bar near Gautier, said that last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the pass Lamb won on the guitar and harmony for countless dubs.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We lied and made each other a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boy Student Club and the Student Government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, employees, students and community members, participated in the commemorative events with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and Brother Jeff Schnitt also attended the Vigilance, during which the university congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made a phone call on the emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called his wife Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were actually betrayed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us states that they do not recruit as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of toys and products claims that it gives current employees and seasonal workers the chance to work out more hours.
The company also indicated that it is planning to hire around 40,000 employees to work in trade and distribution centres across the country, which is a decrease compared to 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start with a number of applicants this month, and the employee will collect during October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to receive temporary assistance in trade and sales to send and deliver the goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his rendezvous with Princess Diana
The "Back to the Future" premiere was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Foxe.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater and waiting for the king's family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I felt that Princess Diana would be sitting there," said in the trailer for the coming document, "Back in time."
The movie starts and I happen to be on something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Back in time," is a document on "Return to the Future," which introduces talks with Fox, Leo Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The "Back to the Future" premiere was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's really the undisputed best travel document that's ever been filmed."
"Back in time" will be available at the VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict of nearly five years' conflict and more weapons only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The head of the UN urgently again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support the inclusive dialogue on finding a political solution.
Ban said to the Central Press Conference that the plan is to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the end of the ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He voiced his indignation at the fact that the division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "has made this situation insurmountable."
The Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity, which they demonstrated when reaching the Iranian nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him a person who often changes his mind.
The others had their hands on them like an unscrupulous joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But if some Republicans are trying to get Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they're not doing it (so far).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of a two-digit number, and some people start seriously asking what that means for the nomination of this magnet from the real estate area.
Of course it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump will probably win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this time of 2011, Rick Perry made his way to the uprising of Herman Cain, and finally not one of them won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might be in the general election.
But external groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to sustain and begin to spend their dollars on the stand in order to defeat him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that indicate that the real magnet is not just a flexible phase:
The Trump rating was 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's vote showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real magnet.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 say they have a negative view of him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the vote of the University of Quinnipiac last week, it was found that 60 per cent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP will be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said they would be either "inspired" or "satisfaction" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 argued that they would be "enraged" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of excitement as Trump (43 per cent of people said they would be "inspired" against 40 per cent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters claim to be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if they favor Jeb Bush as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his inefficiency and insults, 52 per cent of Republican voters are fully inclined to think that the real magnet has the right temperament for the president's post, according to the Monday vote of ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held at the Iowa Senate State Club, which is the first in the whole country where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the personality of the commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent feel that he has no personality to serve effectively, and almost 6 out of 10 independent people say that his temper does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When he puts on his student hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question of who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's the change from late July when four out of 10 put their money on the fucking Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
This time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the 28% nomination for any Mitt Romney nomination.
However, it is shown that a certain number of GOPs see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even though the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump will still beat almost everyone.
Some students stress that the disbanded field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trumpo support is widely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the study of Monmouth University from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives most support.
He runs over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jebe Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christi by 33 points at everyone.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would lead over a 19-point-wide dealer in a hypothetical one-to-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's climbers claim they've already made their opinion.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only half of Trump’s supporters claim that they will no longer change their opinion.
Clearly, many things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 per cent said they were keeping open the back door for change between candidates.
However, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outside partner neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign's announcement campaign, immigration is still held as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversion.
Some fear that Trump's rigour is depriving key Hispanic voters of the Republican side and damaging efforts to rebrand.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday's public opinion, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that while the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight of reflectors, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Frustration from the government is reaching new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half of the support from the Republican voters, especially given their state of the outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post Monday vote claim they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
The vote of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, 54 per cent are "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent are "heavy."
The House supported a higher share of the state's carbon charges.
The Czech Republic is earning more than 400 million.
At first reading, the photo gallery supported the government's new top law, which regulates the amount of charges from the coal mining surface from the mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised Members that they would also receive money from the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticised by members of the opposition, who fear that tax firms will no longer want to sponsor the city as well as so far, because they will pay higher charges directly to the state budget.In the first reading, the House supported the government's new top law, which means that the state should receive more of the proceeds of the tax on carbon from mining companies.
The state share increases to 67 per cent, while the share of municipalities decreases from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also modifies the way in which companies calculate the remuneration for non-growth.
The change in non-growth charges is expected to result in a state treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The government's budget revenue is expected to have a neutral impact, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipality received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the coal mine, about 200 million crowns and a state of 66 million crowns went to the municipalities.
Novela also counts with an increase in the premium from the supply space with an allowable yield of 1000 kroner per hectare per year.
The revenue from these refunds shall continue to be wholly owned by the municipality.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this means that the locals receive 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the levy will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be recalculated as a sum of the amount of the unclaimed unclaimed and the rates for individual types of unclaimed unclaimed.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Ambassador Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mlądka, however, this is not a tax case, because the state is paying for the non-growth that is state property.
Fees shall be granted only to a town whose territory is affected by the distress.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same will be true in the case of the extraction of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that will be charged from the proceeds will be clearly linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage after removal or to provide a bailout service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that they would harm the affected villages and countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Seniors) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the city as well as so far, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just because the Minister of Finance is improving his budget," said David Kádner (Ausvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, she warned the KSČM MP Han Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická were unsuccessfully proposing to reject the novel, Kučera wanted the law back to the government for processing.
The explanatory report states that according to the companies concerned, the increase in charges will not be projected at carbon prices because prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
Therefore, the main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that tax organizations will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which would above all mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in charges from the point of view of employment is exorbitant.
According to the report on Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is key for Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept before the adoption of the law and the government's main decision on carbon capture limits.
If coal is stretched beyond borders, then it will have an impact on profits for both the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits below ČSA should already be broken for social, national and economic reasons and for the long-term stability of foreign energy.
Happy will lead the Czechs as one, the setting will affect the weather.
All four common waiters will appear during the quarter of the Davis Cup bar in India on the table and this time each of them will probably get into the game.
Captain Jaroslav Back plans to impose a burden on the whole quarter due to difficult conditions.
The Dill is hot and high humidity of the air, which is why heavy fighting is expected, which can stretch up to five hundred.
We've got to get it in line.
I'd like to spread it by weather.
And according to what it looks like, he said He's back at today's Czech election training in the center of Radje Kumár Khanny.
With one team and the world's 40th Jirzy Happy, he counts for a Friday and Sunday double.
The two positions are likely to flow to Lukas Rosol and Radek Štěpánek.
I'd like to get involved with almost everyone.
I've got it in my head, but I'm not gonna tell you yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech constitution should be Stěpánkova's participation in the Saturday 4th.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to an experienced oblivion who has a four-point balance in Davis' cup 18:4.
Probably won't be happy.
There's still room for Rosole, or Adam Pavlás.
"I really don't know who and what it's gonna look like," he said.
It's decided by development twice.
It can be a variant of Pavlásek, with Happy surprise in the 1st round win in the fat over Australia.
"He's right to the fat," said the Return.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I'd like to perform the same performance I've shown since the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience, and I'd like to bring the point," said Pavlásek.
The home is set to two Yuki Bhambris (125th in the ATP knife), which won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where players won the third and fourth hundred swords.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
They're both challengers and our ATP Tour experience, but many times we've convinced ourselves that the swords in Davis cup don't decide.
"It decides the momentary form, the weather," said the Return.
Friday's opening two games will start at 6:30 SELČ and can be drawn because of the weather.
According to the prediction, the shower is not under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting, if any.
It's already burned and it's got some two thousand luxuryes, which is enough.
"It should be able to play under the lights," said Return.
Jeremy Corbyn will be debuting at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corby's debut in PMQ is highly expected
The new head of staff Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time he will work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions assigned shortly after noon, while his performance will probably be carefully examined by the media and Members.
In his weekly statement, he asked for "less theatres and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave with his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr Corby, who comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
In the meantime, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the national anthem in service on Tuesday at the occasion of the 75th annual battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative Members, and a few stories on the headlines are focused on the news.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
The speaker, Mr. Corbyn, said that he would "stand in silence" and that he would recognize "the hero of the royal flight in the battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight that the Labour Leader would recommend that the national anthem sing "no matter" on his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve at the top of Mr Corby's team, cited differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties initially supported him as leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the political differences in work are also "organised" after Mr Corby's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's dose limit.
Mr Corbyl pointed out at the TUC conference that the DP put forward amended proposals to eliminate the whole idea of dose limits.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the secretary of shadow work and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the D.A., faced by David Cameron for the last decade since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The head of the business party, who promised a different approach to politics, claims that he has ideas "from the bottom" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQ is too confrontational and that it will refrain from both "preparation responses," as well as from traffic, and instead promises to focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secret, will represent him at PMQ when he is not involved — for example, when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also left out the idea that he would let other colleagues out of his office from time to time because he would hear that he was still discussing the whole thing with John Bercow.
When Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to turn away from the style of politics "Punch and Judy," which was often linked to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of the decision of the leaders, their management of the camera and their position among the other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become cartoons and need far-reaching reforms.
"Photonization in Johannesburg": Young homeless trained as photographers
The Johannesburg Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I was shot in Johannesburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make money like that.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

Libra is rising, while wage growth in the United Kingdom accelerates
Libra jumped on the following data and showed British wage growth recovery, while FTSE 100 was led up by SABMiller's bid target.
Between May and June, GB profits including bonuses rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling stood more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at €1.3730.
FTSE 100 closed at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional player on the market and jumped by 20% after getting closer to the offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and the proximity of such brands as Budwieser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the Richemont luxury group.
The latest Richemont sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have begun to climb again.
Shares in Glencore stepped up by 5% after the demanding giant said that steps up by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in Mondi's packaging and paper group were the biggest decline in the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating on the company for "sales."
JD Sports stepped by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in half a year in profits before tax £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage expansion
Executive President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would exceed the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague apartment marshmeloon sing.
The controversial building got a trace.
The investor Prague Progetti e Investment considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is to take place close to the Anežka monastery in the centre of Prague, protested before the Prague office of 1 hundred people, including petitions.
The Court found in the decision that there had been a breach of the building law because not all the provisions of the territorial decision had been complied with.
"The subject-matter of the territorial decision does not include certain aspects, such as the types of land, the distance from neighbouring buildings, the sufficiently clear and understandable form of the building, the definition of the areas affected by the impact of the building," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the grounds for the decision have been issued to the documents initially discussed but have changed.
For example, it is an opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
However, it follows from the dossier that the owner of the land submitted only agreement with the project documentation for the management of the land, not agreement with the location of the building on his land, the construction committee writes.
According to Francesca Augusta Rasett, the construction board of the investment firm did not take into account the decision of the managing authority - the Ministry of Local Development, which has already expired the deadline for the initiation of the review.
Anyway, it's a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," said Rasetto in a press release.
The project, which people are named marshmeloon because of its supposedly proposed façades, creates a strong emotion in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people gathered in the past to protest the building.
Associations and residents of nearby homes are wrong that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticise the inadequacy of the building for the historical centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Anežka monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Franek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a glass facade, rejected the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPU) and cancelled the permit of Prague Memorialists in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investments with face-to-face windows was approved by the NPU and the magistrates, and building permits were issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the conclusions of the opponents, because he never counted with the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after the pink-white candy.
Czech politics has brought migrants together.
The Hungarians put him in the base with them.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to refugees.
On his way, he took three Syrian refugees with him to the car, who were about a mile away.
At that time, according to him, it had not yet been criminalized in Hungary, he claimed to the People's News.
We knew that law enforcement officers didn't commit such acts.
But when the police stopped us, they arrested us for our surprise and transferred us to an investigation in Szeged, he wrote a letter.
At last he spent nine hours in politics.
The police were acting right, but the communications were tied, because they didn't have too good English.
However, he felt that prison was sad.
For example, in our cell about the size of about three times four meters there were 15 refugees from Syria.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would follow, Berg said.
What can't be fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9., from 9:30 he will answer the readers' questions to answer the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mr Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her for changes to the enforcement law applicable from 1 September 2015 as well as for other executions or executions.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's efforts in South and West Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 shops in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand using mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are added to brands such as Dunsborough-based ice creamer Simmo's offering tastes in the IGA trades and owners of stores are selling cheap tickets to local customers on the Australian football league.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investment strategy day.
There is a lot in the bet, because South and West Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's trade steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA trades have a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in eastern countries.
Anyhow, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi is relying on 5% of the food market in these two states during the 12th months since the opening of the first trades that took over the markets from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week in his report analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that retail IGA could lose USD 360 million on annual sales and USD metcash 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 trades in South Australia and 30 in the West during the following year and will generate sales of 500 million and 600 million USD in individual markets.
The loss of sales of food and volume in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost it around USD 13 million on pre-tax profits, confirmed Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its share in markets in the eastern states, mainly towards Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan's latest research found that the buyers in the IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the fund manager of Hamish Douglas, founder of the financial group Magellan, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it is known that a member of Metcash's representation contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the profit from Metcash's food trade, which supplies around 1200 retail IGA, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the change in speculation, as sales and profits are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone into counter-attack and invests more than USD 150 million a year to match desktop prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and thus helps retail IGA reequipment stores by adding fast growing food and news from private.
Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price comparison and trade acquisition programmes are falling and hopes that the large-scale return will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a further loss in recent habits around his friend Nick Kyrgiose and deserves his praise rather than criticism, says President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented two often called "Special Ks", drew unwelcome attention to himself through an affair with a notorious Kyrgyz and Stan Wawrink on Montreal Masters.
Soon thereafter, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, they had to be Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice separated by the judge, then Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have pulled one on Kyrgyz and I should have pulled him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after the cracking of Richard Gasquet's possible success at the US Open, Kokkinakis stood firm for Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for the second round of Bernard Romice in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little caught up in the entire dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his rocket when he lost because of a crack in the U.S., but he's not the first player to blow himself up because of frustration on his rocket. I know Thanasi pretty well and I can say he won't be proud of this event.
But he really ruled very well because he was exposed in the U.S. to a very provocative situation about Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's working very hard and he's getting into the team great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dress, he's training hard, he's in an amazing condition, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to review Kyrgioses for an important match that starts on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra relative to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick stood up very quickly, as the federer, Murray and other people point out, in the eyes of the public is growing rapidly, he also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and for some time beyond the expression, when he's going to be able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to stop the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and Serbian authorities reacted violently.
Those who have stuck to the unknown time on the ground bands between the two states are those who flee from domestic violence and settle in.
But there's a sense of frustration coming.
When the helicopters fly over them, migrants call together "Open Borders!" and give orders to the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water for protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister states it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while more and more of them are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect harm.
During the next few days it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic in Prague claims.
The riots at the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after the 28-state bloc did not come with a single immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in the surprise of Italy and Greece and spoke with hope of reaching an agreement next month or at the end of the year to which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria agreed on Tuesday to a special European summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
The internal state of the threat in two southern regions has given authorities greater power to address the crisis and has allowed them to close the roads and speed up the trial of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto said his country is also planning to build a plot from the rest of the line along the border with Romania to stop refugees who are trying to cross their country once the plot is completed at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D ́Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull the rest of the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months Hungary has become the main point of weakness and entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other countries of the Middle East.
However, the President of the government, Viktor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who pursue a better life and not war refugees who seek protection, which is a view that is clearly different from that of other EU states, including Germany.
New laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing violations of the 4-metre area that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establishes longer prison terms for those who illegally translate refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government announces a state of threat," Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We are quite clear about this: the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament still has to approve the deployment of an army that was waiting for next week, but reporters of the Associated Press on the border have observed a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's home defense counselor, said that the authorities had captured 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been captured in the state.
Pronouncements using fence damage and are now accused of committing crimes under new laws in police custody.
The authorities were quick to fix the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered by the rest of the wire.
At the main border crossing at Roszka there was chaos, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and there was pressure from people.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's attack on Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
The former foreign minister, Hillary Clinton, is still holding a two-digit call at the Democratic National nominee, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching her call.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of the primary democratic elections (down by 58 per cent), while Sanders is in second place 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his wish to become president, has been supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic elections.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions to be supported by the candidates.
But Clinton's sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From last month's CBS News survey, Clinton lost ground under the feet of several demographic groups, while Sanders won a few.
Clinton keeps a big leap between women and calms down, but her leadership is strained.
Her support among men dropped significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points on her.
Clinton's advantage with democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and now they're equal to Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has great leadership thanks to his older willows.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit break in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic primary voters in all states say she would be very supportive of Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
The quarter would support it with certain allowances and another 15 per cent would support it only because it is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not surprising that Clinton's current adherents are particularly disillusioned with her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it.
While 48 per cent of the democratic primary voters say that they would be happy to support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in the open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that it is time to be a woman's president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great possibility of choosing and agreeing on problems.
While the Vice-President is considering a potential candidate for the president, 57 per cent of the democratic primary voters would like to see a third think he should not run again.
If primary democratic voters were asked who would be chosen as the second election for the party's nomination, Biden would be the most common choice.
Among Clinton's favorites, she's listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden will nominate, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning in general elections; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Poor is a far different measure, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it comes to the importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems before a greater election chance.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate shall appear as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Poor of all three leads honestly, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters do not think that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, that is, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not.
The primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all these measures, probably a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions relating to Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal e-mail and the server as State Secretaries continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of this matter and say that their overall view did not affect her at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now discontented with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public’s views on this issue were already divided in March, shortly after this issue came to light.
Most Americans claim that this email dispute has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim their opinion on Clinton got worse.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and confidential among her voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see it as honest and confidential, which is reduced by eight points from last month, and by 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and confidential.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best leaders in honor.
Sanderse sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, just like Carson, a lot of fans didn't think of him.
The error interval for sample 351 of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished with Donald Trump in the national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half of the volunteers in the most recent survey and the others are not looking for support.
Voters from a number of Republicans across the country continue to support Trump by the majority, and have reached 23% of the support in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot 6 to 23% at the same time.
The study also found that Carson is leading a good cross-section of demographic groups, and ranks Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and the governor of the state of Ohio, John Kasiche, is behind with the Wisconsin governor Scott Walker in total with 10% support, down to 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The error range for sample 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% of support among Republicans with 32% of support from Trump.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is ahead of Carson.
At Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot a neurosurgeon blind in the position, and even Carson apologized for questions about Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died during the overcrowding Brotherhood ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a charge of murder was brought against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening of the ceremony in September 2013 and the late took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The police said he had eyes tied up, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed when he tried to reach his goal through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Dog Brotherhood didn't call 911 immediately after Deng left, and allegedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found time to take over Dengo's dress, share his symptoms and contact Andy Menga, the state president of the brotherhood, and ask him for advice, led police chief Chris Wagner to a press conference.
"At this point, members began hiding equipment and essentially gave priority to the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's life," said Chief Wagner.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the poll, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object in the head, body and stand.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of overcrowding in the brotherhood and at least one student dies every year because of overcrowding since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be responsible, and this step is important by the authorities.
The Grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Menga, will also be charged with assaults on overcrowding and criminal society.
"We want to keep not only those involved, but in case there is an organization that approved it, whether officially or informally, we will also take responsibility for it," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the nation’s brotherhood ended its relationship with local branches.
This is what happens when Fed increases interest rates
The growth of interest rates will come and the market will collapse, the proceeds of debt will rise and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy, it specifically offers the story of a small origin of timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why U.S. central banks officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate increase begins, but rather on the trajectory, how long it will take for normalisation.
There are really more variables in the game.
Finally, however, market members can ensure that all speed gains can be exaggerated.
"The first increase in Fed from the time of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," said Julian Jessop, leader of the global economy Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of American interest rates to a more common but still low, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there are adverse effects.
Here is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Due to what the market has recorded for the last cca month, the expected increase in rates may make the air a bit unstable.
But once the increase occurs, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend towards re-stopping the shares after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a shift in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after Fed's increase.
More precisely, the market for the last 35 years is often the most often - about 14 per cent - leading to an increase in interest rates in a ratio of 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield of 14.4 per cent from the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, Nuveen Asset Management's main action strategy, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on the stock tends to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and the return is beginning to decrease.
The recession is really economic, but rising rates often help it.
At present, the Fed faces certain conditions that have not yet existed and that could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that the rough home product close to its lowest point in history when increasing Fed interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only two times below 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, it is unlikely to be maintained when in the third quarter it was only 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could arise, "Is this time different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for Fed's growth all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Committee for the Free Market, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading only indicates a 25% probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the promotion cycles so far have been in the super cycle of increasing the greenhouse effect with HDP covering the beginning of recession very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far longer than when Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are 74 months and we continue.
The firm profit was also volatile, because the market expects an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stock is experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is faster seen in the bonds than in the stock when the Fed changes the policy direction.
In the case of bonds, the income appears to be changing the direction immediately after the first cycle of increase/reduction.
At the end of the cycle of increasing the return on bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
The strategic Charles Schwab believes that the increase in interest rates leads to an approximation of the profits between long- and short-date bonds, which is an even curve.
Debt securities with high yields often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about the voltage," said Kathy Jones, a firm analyst of fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to the Fedea policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the perspectives of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flat, the credit gap has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed reinforces politics.
In general, companies that run most of their business in the United States win after an increase in interest rates and local products become more attractive.
An international company with a lot of debts will get worse, as the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the "quality" of the action tends to prevail within three months of the initial increase in rates," analysts Goldman Sachsen said in a customer report.
Strong-balance-sheet companies have seen weak balance-sheet companies in every increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains, as well as low volatility stocks, also exceeded their countermeasures by an average of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of mobile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely action games, consumers are also weighed down by the rising dollar.
Entrepreneurs can also see their profits through higher incomes, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "sucking"
The view that he is still more unrecognizable than his commercial rival
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on Britain
A colleague from Damien Collins attacked the Voice and said he is not the original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, claiming a leading MP and collecting fresh air pressure to prove that they are doing something that commercial broadcasts are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the heads of the BBC that the public service broadcasting station seems to be "insane" and is still more unrecognizable than his commercial opponent.
"Radio 3 seems to be--I don't like using the word "crazy"--but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be Britain under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me when you're actually just like what we already have on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The director general of the BBC accused him of denying that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 wouldn't teach on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and creating music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Director Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to the leaks on the road to commercial competitors during the broadcasting of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the Commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show purchased by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is being discussed as a non-original and not in any other way different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith aBoy George as judges - was produced "in a typical way for BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own state" when the next time he started a fun series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of several future series of The Voice series or the loss of money from the fees of the licensee for other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales with the slowest pace since August and wine can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth was recorded since the year 2000.
Internet sales were strengthened three years ago due to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the reason for delaying the loss
For more than a decade, virtual shopping was on the rise, and thanks to it, many of the British main streets became cities of spirits.
However, experts claim that there are signs of online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August was the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement alone, with only 5 per cent increase compared to last year.
Experts claim that there are signs of online sales, and new data show a seven-percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," says the Guardian Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Market Index.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to perform purchases.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (growth) is getting a little lower, so it seems to be getting back.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was desired from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
Experts believe that customers may withhold purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average buyers turned to their computers to build up their purchases and agree on several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, through which buyers recontract, can keep customers from other purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was lost online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of sales are carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion shops.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the irraw in Mexico and the family Bin Ladina was punished
The bodies of 29 dead were transported by the streets of the Muslim during the first burial in Mexico
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the hurricane disappeared
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the falls of the Great Mosque in Mexico.
Dressed to a certain extent in white, the mourners chose the road and gave up respect to the victim when the first of the fallen ones got on their last trip to the graves in Al-Moassem.
The sad message passed around the sanctuary, where in just a few days earlier the construction site of the site was breached by the ceiling of the mosque and turned to the believers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Ládin family over a disaster that also left 394 injured.
The 29 bodies of the dead after the fall of the hierarchy in Grand Central Moscow in Mexico were carried away by the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children of Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first path when the frog disappeared.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the launch of the annual haj route.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hague will take place in Mecca, and thousands of people continue to enter the city.
King Salman today stated that Binadin Group should not have left his shoulder on the top when he was not in operation.
The Arab version of the statement by the state operated by the Saudi Press Agency states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of a fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that travel abroad was prohibited to company heads.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to discover what caused the falls of the irreproach in the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims cover before the Hajs were buried later this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements on the collapsing of the hierarchy and its representatives were not made available for comment.
The royal statements also accused the group of not using the latest security measures and the lack of coordination with weather officials.
Tens of frogs surround Grand Mosque in Mexico, which is part of the massive construction effort in front of Binladin Group.
Binladin's family was close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and are running large construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaeda Usama bin Ládin was the son of a renegade who was denied by the family in the '90s.
The accident took place in the midst of a strong wind and rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a path that must, at least once in life, graduate every decent Muslim.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be devoted to relatives of the deceased and the same amount for permanent injuries.
Other injuries shall receive half of this amount.
Chief B&Q claims that traders in Eastern Europe who are already working cheaply
The British are increasingly employed by professionals, says Veronique Laury
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is at the point of growth
As a result, 200 Screwfix stores focused on traders are open
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country

The British piers deposit beads and pears and hand them over to trained Eastern European professionals to work at home
If you're dealing with a bet or a paint brush, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employed by professionals to do the killing work at home, according to the company's head for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns a domestic supply chain, claims that the large increase in the number of educated traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury claims that she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are doing better half-way.
Currently, most male workers are male.
She said that there is a need to address rising demographic trends, which show more women's households, which make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "We still have a lot of men working in our stores.
We need to get closer to the balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of the decisions regarding the purchase of goods.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, who is one of only five women in the company's corporate regulators according to the British FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect equality between the directors of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost alone in that he has half the representation of women between employees including executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laury says: "It was a conscious decision - the diversity is an important subject here.
So it wasn't hard to find good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher reported a fall both in profit in the middle of the year and sales after the group assumed the costs of closing the shops.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new shops
The 600 kroner's contribution to pensioners is in danger.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of accountability.
The President of the ODS MEPs Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-time contribution is sounding good, but it would be better for him to be in standard valuation for a long time, because he would also promise to go on for years.
"We have room to find the mechanism we're going to fix," said Stanjura.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaely Marks (CHSSD), according to which the following year was to be valued above the law.
Marks defended the grant with the argument that it would improve the social situation of pensioners who are not pink according to it.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every stamilion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) rightly recalled that in the past, the rate of valorization has decreased.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
This right of payment in December complicates and may even be incapacitated, he said.
The President of the ČSSD Roman Glasses therefore proposed a reduction in the time limit for the discussion of the standard in the Committee for 10 or 20 days, and also blocked the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is supposed to come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in particular.
In the coming year, pensions should increase on average about the stock market.
A contribution should be made according to the pension plan of people who will have a pension claim or part of it in December.
They could get it even those who lost their pension claim in December before it was paid out.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly by January, which is about price growth and third growth of real wages.
This year, it corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 per cent.
According to the State Final Account 314.7 billion kroner, the state's old-age pension was about five billion per annum.
Expenditure on old-age pensions represented 26 per cent of all budget expenditure and 46 per cent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full oldage pension was raised last year, according to data in the State Final Account of 104 to 10,714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Administration has paid 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has left plans for a political career, he's going to dedicate himself to science.
At the same time, the Senate chair had a billionaire according to the Russian media to a certain extent.
In the Council of the Federation, he was to represent the western Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate for the government of the United Russia, defended his position in Sunday's elections with an overview.
Under Russian laws, the senators do not choose citizens, but he elects a governor from three candidates whose names are announced before the governorial elections.
After the election, the senator of three candidates will choose for himself.
The complication for Jakunina was that in Kaliningrad region he did not live 20 years as required by law.
Although the Kremlin for Jakunina found an exception by being an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, which does not apply to the legal requirement of a long-term stay.
The Czech comedy theory tiger's film is over.
The last step in the precept of the main hero is the voluntary death of his rope, to which strength and patience have come.
Granny - Iva Janjur's been discussing grandfather's life, age and funeral.
Jan is clear that he is on a similar path with his wife, Olga - Eliška Balzer.
He will remember that once he had his own will and dreams, he wanted to live with dignity and freedom again.
It is difficult to regain control over his life - and as a solution he will choose to escape from the past, he has led to the story of Slavík.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in comedy form, in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning it was clear that the main role would be Bartoškov, with whom he had already collaborated on the Invisible series.
However, the actor who appeared before the camera after a longer break with the rehab after a serious illness surprised him.
We made a deal three years ago.
I gave him the script and he said he likes how sad he is.
And he surprised me that he's probably a prom athlete.
Because before the film, he was always asking where he was going to sit.
This time he was riding a bike, he was walking down the rocks, and he even went up the hill.
And all this in record tropical weather, the director suggested.
According to Bartoška, women take a tiger to make a rabbit in time.
They're gonna feed him a little bit, but they're gonna close the door right away so he doesn't think he's playing off the tiger's rabbit.
And we're trying to tell our movie, the actor said.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, created Eliška Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, intelligent, empathic, and she thinks it's good.
But at the same time, she's an insurgent and wants her husband to be burned to death, Bajgar said.
The film also parallels the fates of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tána Wilhelm and Pavla Beretová - and the sons of Erika and Pepika - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Razlas and TV Slovensko.
Google promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US Internet company Google promised to provide up to $5.5 million (13.2.6 million CZK) to organisations that help thousands of refugees flow to Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, which is the charity of this internet company.
Azerbaijan cancelled the part of Teličk's visit to criticise human rights violations.
The Czech MP of the European Parliament for the move of ANO Pavel Telička has postponed the coming quarter trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities have cancelled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telejka, Baku is justified by last week's EP resolution, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telejka was co-author.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani Telicka Party, the possibility of talks with official partners and also of visiting political prisoners, which depends on the agreement of the authorities, was explained by its Brussels office in its press statement.
The route, which was planned a few months ago, was intended to use Telička to meet with the leadership of parliament and executive representatives, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, clarified the text sent by the ČTK.
EP resolution condemns "unforeseen repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political prosecution.
The resolution was adopted shortly after a recent judgment on Azerbaijan's opposition journalist Chadji Ismail, who was working to expose corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude that it builds its flight base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the future of the Russian air base in Syria when he visited Novosibirsk.
We don't have any plans yet.
But nothing is excluded, he declared.
Russia already has a sea base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which has so far been used as a service and logistics centre.
According to reports from the Russian press, from the beginning of August supplies of Russian weapons and military material to Syria had risen.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the current trade agreements.
The Pentagon argues that the Russians intend to establish an air base near Latakia, which remains for the time being the garden of Syrian President Bashar Asad.
But Washington does not have any concrete military intentions of Russia in Syria completely clear, American commentators agree.
US Foreign Minister John Kerry spoke to Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, which was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears in Moscow to express concern over the gathering of Russian arsenals near Israel.
The speaker of the White House, Josh Earnest, marked the support of Asada from Moscow for the lost bet.
Russia's policy objectives in Syria have declared them rather unclear.
Moscow, according to him, made her satellite from Syria.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is following a longer-term goal, but which, according to Earlest, is not quite clear.
According to today's Russian press speculations, the war in Syria is to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming United Nations General Meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to speak at all about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to today's report in The New York Times, the US government does not exclude President Barack Obama from meeting with the Russian President during the UN meeting.
But the views among the White House's advisors are still spreading.
The TASS agency today, recalling the words of the Kremelian speaker Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin had no meeting with Obama on the program of his New Yorker stay.
Set sesame oil on the stomach diet, the hemp helps strengthen the immune system.
A good way to increase the strain of unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when the seeds are harvested in the cold.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of a health diet, such as biliary.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of the Czech death for several years.
Gastrointestinal inflammation is mainly affecting women, helping sesame oil.
If you are among lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the diet of the stomach.
The essential fatty acids that contain are a good prevention of the formation of stomach stones.
These are due to 90% of the causes of biliary inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
Generally, problems with the stomach are especially related to overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used successfully even with a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to benefit from all the health benefits that bring consumption of this oil, they should pay attention to products from exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use overcrowded seeds that have a more pronounced taste.
But oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk, who produces organic virgin oil liquefied for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unsaturated seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our fox will be able to draw 8 kilos of sesame.
The raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of an extra lady.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil thrives in heart and lungs.
The Czech favorite among the oil is the sunflower.
From Jarmila Hammerska's research, which led to Masaryk's University, he found that he preferred 43% of the respondents in the hot kitchen.
However, it is not actually suitable to fry, and at 180 °C it is starting to burn.
It is better to use it, for example, for salad digestion, and it is especially appropriate in a diet that helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It therefore contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids most reduce cholesterol levels.
In the case of heart problems, attention should be paid to the amount of fat and calories taken in total.
For example, there are 62 calories in one bed of sunflower oil, 99 calories in the bed of rape oil.
With regard to the energy value of food, it is important to realize that much more suitable are natural foods with nutrients than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to get extra doll oil.
The sunflower lasts as long as the moon and moon for 9 months.
The storage in the refrigerator is still ongoing.
Old oil people especially know according to the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there's no trouble at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Tail oil contains the most healthy acids.
Seeds of the technical hemp are listed for so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the most healthy of plant oils.
For this designation, the maximum content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids is to be taken into account.
These essential fatty acids cannot produce the body itself and man must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume her 0.6 grams, but the Icelandic will receive 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Tail oil should be included in the dining room as part of a supportive diet to enhance immunity and when wounding.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to fear the use of foot oil, they don't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumption confirms the fact that in Bohemia Oil is one of the most sold.
He sells it 500 liters a year.
People often use one of the lies in the morning.
The oil in the cane is not quite tangible, but it greatly enhances immunity, advised Daniel Wolfek of the beauty company Bohemia Oil.
According to statistics, they are the most popular nation of American grillers.
There's 1.4 grills in one house.
All over the world, then, the most diverse competitions are held in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
They're not even Czech.
On the basis of consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in the world were not grilled.
The vast majority then grilled several times a year.
To make the grilling successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by seafaring several hours before the heat adjustment.
Which oil is the most suitable for it, and at the same time, it leaves healthy beneficial substances?
Generally speaking, the grilling process itself should be saved by a thum.
Experts agree that much of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oil then also comes from the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from when we consume oils from food adjusted at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean extra virgin oils won't find their use when grilling.
Horrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, the experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslic to Sokolovsk will immediately be equipped with a terrible oil.
Amazingly, it complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen has a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling because it has a high level of burning up to 216 °C.
Even at this high temperature, therefore, as one of the few oils preserves the health of the beneficial substance, describes the advantages of the terrible oil Daniel Wolfek from Bohemia Oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this oil from the vine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating cholesterol overdose.
Our body also accepts important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals in the mineral oil.
Thanks to the positive content of these substances, high blood pressure is reduced, metabolism is increased, and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
We also help to enhance our outer beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps with the care of dry and fragile hair.
The chefs approve of the use of horrible oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of frozen foods, for example when milking salads, but also for the heat treatment of food.
Thus, the grilling can be used immediately in two ways, in sailing and grilling itself.
Marine meat and fish preserve their chastity.
Three components must be present during the preparation of the marinade: oil, acidity and roots.
Acidity, for example, is added to the apple octam and we aim to soften the meat.
The root again provides a lot of flavor and oil preserves and delivers the right crop, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that horrid oil is ideal for sailing because as one of the few oils it can ease through dark meat.
Marined meat or fish, then, are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are marked by the fact that only a few caps are sufficient to prepare food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
It concerns, in particular, flax, hemp and oat oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, you'll start to grow oil, so you won't burn food.
The necessary part of the grilling is also the preparation of the Annex.
Grilled meat and fish fit practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
You need: • 1 cup of broccoli • 1 cup of broccoli • 1 cup of pasta • 1 cup of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of rice oil
Add to the salad bag a mixture of salad leaves with pressed handcuffs, fried pasta and large fried brosks.
Depending on your taste, you can also feel the milk chilli and soy sauce.
To conclude, bury a few drops of terrible oil.
For exceptional taste, then you can savor salads with finely ground almonds.
Dispersed sclerosis: not only depends on medicines, but also on the patient’s will to fight.
Sclerosis is a complex disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of experts: neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with spread sclerosis need advice, if they decide to have a child, but also about social legislation, recommendations on housing, etc.
However, all of this is not enough: the development of the disease can affect the patient itself in a fundamental way.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work, and doesn't have to change the style of his life.
As doctors warn, the patient’s passiveness releases space for disease activity.
For example, it has been shown that the regular movement greatly delays the time when the patient needs some compensation aid, such as a bullet.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not rely on different myths, such as that the disease automatically leads to the end of the vehicle.
That's why the website Daj is a chance (www.bezmytu.cz) which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Daj is a chance.
The most important person in the care of a disease with spread sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of scattered sclerosis, it is suggested twice that the earlier treatment of the disease, the more the effect the doctor may have.
That's because we have drugs on the scattered sclerosis at an inactivated stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we get hit, the more hope is that we will be able to stop and remove the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with scattered sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which is the most common solution to lower limb weakness or imbalance.
He works with the patients according to their individual needs: to maintain the condition, improve walking, strengthen the landing day, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific difficulties," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Clinic for Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Faculty Hospital in Motole.
People with spread sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it is shown in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, mobile activity also reinforces the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in the case of scattered sclerosis.
Another positive feature of regular exercise is that patients check everything they can, and it strengthens their self - confidence.
"In practice, the endorphins are also flowing and the person feels good about it," notes PhDr. Kamila Rásová of the Rehabilitation Clinic Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vineyard.
By influencing the physical page, we affect the limbic system responsible for emotions.
That's exactly how we interfere with psychiatry and immune processes and stabilize the disease, it delivers.
"Before these patients were so investigated, we know today that they need a targeted burden," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, the Advantage of the Rehabilitation Clinic and the Medical School Hospital in Motole.
The goal of physical therapy is to keep a person as self-sufficient as long as possible, including work placement.
Therefore, physiotherapists cooperate with ergotherapists so that each person can receive a compensation aid ear for him in peace.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will wake it up.
They're experiencing shock, panic, fear.
It has to respond to a great burden - a loss of health.
With such a troubled soul, we must follow someone, not try to take everything away on our own.
"I'm working with them to finally conclude that even with a disabled person, life can be meaningful and that scattered sclerosis doesn't mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague Latecoeer manufacturer, the airbuses wouldn't fly.
Aerial production is a synonym for precision and advanced technologies.
New aircraft are filled with titanium or light and solid composite materials, which one cannot immediately produce and process.
However, beside super-precise, computer-controlled processing machines, along with autoclaves for the formation of composites, it is possible to attack something as common as maroon mushrooms.
In the drum, which resembles a cane on a sugar beet, in the pack the edges of the sheet parts that have just come out of the milling machine are popular.
"No one has come to a better conclusion for me," smiles Ivan Dubský, Director General of Aviation Door Manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in the Prague Latvians, the former Flight is producing a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they're delivering a door to the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors which form part of Prague also enter passengers into the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world’s largest aircraft Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
Maybe the moment key lets the company handle twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a check record, the Prague competition should explain to the airbus or Boeing auditors who drive regularly whether the door is manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
Human senses, however, have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
There's 1,500 knots on one door to A320.
Those swimmers have to tear themselves apart by hand.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the falling bet, they know if it's already properly torn apart.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
Njet can range from zero to 0.13 millimetres above the plane surface.
It's about double the thickness of human hair.
A series of trained matter will come under control.
If the controller passes his finger through a row of noses, he'll know if there's anyone out of tolerance.
Then we'll take the exact angler into our hand.
The year before 1989 was a food programme for the military military aircraft L-39.
But not one of them was made in 1991.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
She then joined the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
He won the selection procedure on the emergency door supplier for model A321.
Talking to Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were for them at that time a small company that did not have enough money to invest and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supplies," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American producer would be delighted if Letov did not attend the Prague conference of the International Association of Aeronautics to the French Latecoere Group in 1999.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
The second day the conversation with the French was broken up, says Dubský.
About a year later Latecoere bought a Czech company and with a strong company came new orders.
Immediately in 2000, the installation of the door parts for A320 was broken up.
Three years later, the upper deck door for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company set up a new composition processing hall for Boeing Dreamliner supplies.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we could do some parts or something.
Partners want a warranty for 20 or 30 years, explains Dubský.
Last year, Czech Latecoere gained a turnover of over 2.9 billion and profits after taxing 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between the supplier of aircraft manufacturers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certificates and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't have produced any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the manufacturing processes comply with customer requirements, and to maintain them in repeated checks, it is up to Dubian million crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and tighter.
We have to train employees, supply equipment and re-certify the entire process, Dubský supplies.
Now the company is finalising the process for zinc and nickel decommissioning, which replaces the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
The tasks were received from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they used in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're also checking our lab.
One set of samples test themselves in their laboratories and then compare the results with ours, approaching the Dub way the receivers control them.
The remuneration is long-term exclusive contracts for Prague companies.
The Prague race stands today and the production of embryos falls.
For A320 he manufactures half of the total volume of the door.
The replacement of the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But it doesn't mean he could say any price at all.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how many doors one door will stand after ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces made.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to get into this price pattern.
If we don't, we'll make it, says Dubský.
Half of the hall, where the electric boxes are completed for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft, is still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the wall there is a new semi-robotic line for diving and installation door for an innovative model A320 Neo.
The nesting is speeding up and speeding up.
"It's a trend that the assembly takes off in flight," Dubský adds.
The rest of the line is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3278 pieces of new A320.
Only a few meters away will create a line for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full installation could start in two years, says Dubský.
Before then, however, the company must undergo qualification tests necessary for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment at the door for the largest airbus.
The company is also investing in further development of composite materials production.
In addition to Boeing, she should also participate in the new Airbus A350 programme, which will compete with the American Dreamline.
"It is a huge credit for the company when it is able to process compositions in addition to metal materials," Dubský proudly says.
Latecoere, however, reaches the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no place else in Letov's area where he lives.
Before the entry of the French mother, she had 180 employees.
Now he's 800 and within three years he could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of how many hundreds of new aircraft command each year, they don't have to be afraid.
Although he has orders for several years in advance, the mother company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay the rent.
Finally, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main believers.
At the end of August, part of the loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors received a share of 37.4 per cent of the capital increase in the company.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, that is 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company described a new share of EUR 222.9 million among the existing shareholders.
In total, the base capital amounted to EUR 280 million.
However, the whole group is suffering from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 per cent on the markets.
The average contract growth is expected to be four per cent annually until 2017.
The contract book has orders of 2.6 billion euros, corresponding to four years of production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the hoods.
The Czech competition in the Prague Latvians is important for groups.
It contributes 16 per cent to the group's markets.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The messengers supported a higher share of the state's carbon charges.
The change in non-growth charges is expected to result in a state treasury of 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The government's budget revenue is expected to have a neutral impact, as the fee is expected to be higher.
In the preceding year, the municipality received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget of 150 million crowns.
From the coal mine, about 200 million crowns and a state of 66 million crowns went to the municipalities.
Novala also counts with an increase in the yield from the supply space with a permitted yield of a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The revenue from these refunds shall continue to be wholly owned by the municipality.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the MPs that this means that the locals receive 14 million to 100 million crowns each year.
The amount of the levy will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The refund shall be recalculated as a sum of the amount of the unclaimed unclaimed and the rates for individual types of unclaimed unclaimed.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Ambassador Marek Benda warned that the establishment of a fee by the government regulation should not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mlądka, however, this is not a tax case, because the state is paying for the non-growth that is state property.
Fees shall be granted only to a town whose territory is affected by the distress.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the city's money and a quarter of the state will be obtained.
The same will be true in the case of the extraction of radioactive mines.
The part of the money that will be charged from the proceeds will be clearly linked.
For example, 28 per cent will have to go to repair damage after removal or to provide a bailout service.
Today's proposal was criticised by opposition Members, who claimed in particular that they would harm the affected village and the countries.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Seniors) warned that businesses would no longer want to sponsor the city as well as so far, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just because the Minister of Finance is improving his budget," said David Kádner (Ausvit) elected in the Ústek region.
Before the increase in unemployment in Mosteck, she warned the KSČM MP Han Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická were unsuccessfully proposing to reject the novel, Kučera wanted the law back to the government for processing.
The explanatory report states that according to the companies concerned, the increase in charges will not be projected at carbon prices because prices are more than 90 per cent long-term.
Therefore, the main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should not feel price increases.
"On the other hand, however, this fact increases the risk that tax organizations will compensate for the increase in wages to reduce their operating costs, which would above all mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in charges from the point of view of employment is exorbitant.
According to the report on Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is key for Members to know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept before the adoption of the law and the government's main decision on carbon capture limits.
If coal is stretched beyond borders, then it will have an impact on profits for both the state and the country, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with the Youth that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits below ČSA should already be broken for social, national and economic reasons and for the long-term stability of foreign energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days' time on Wednesday and Thursday to make a fundamental decision on whether to increase interest rates for the first time after almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists named by agency Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for some time and leave interest rates of 0-0.25 per cent.
It's a historical event, because it's been a long time since Fed reduced interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of zero and start the process of normalising interest rates," says Angel Ubide, head of Peterson Institute for the International Economy.
The US economy has managed relatively well, there has been recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore the less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for enlargement, but the circumstances also show that they also see great odds against this step.
The decision is to be notified on Thursday 20:00.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later on the same day as his colleague - wrote a message in which he claimed that he was "lucky" his first murder and that he wanted to be able to take it back, revealed to government authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier in Mississippi said Lamb, a geography teacher and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning about ten o'clock
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb's dispatcher asked him to send cops to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, which "will not bother anyone", but is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also didn't explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb, which said: “I’m so sorry, and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving the message, Lamb went on a 300-mile long journey to Delta University, where he killed teachers of Ethan Schmidt's history and then took his own life.
Dean of William LaForge University said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "the head of Mr Lamb obviously played something".
Despite a statement on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss and Schmidt, government authorities have stated that there is no "mender triangle" for "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, said she was a great person.
Divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both stayed friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "shrewd" the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald said, was working with Prentiss from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb was talking to his relatives on Monday and said he's not going to jail.
When the police reached him on the road near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a biography published on school websites, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of education at Delta University in spring 2015.
Stars That Lost Their Magic
The actor (left), on the picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
He fought leukemia in 2001 and lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was detained for drug possession in 2008.
All these things certainly choose their tax.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be a few months from the game for a double breaking.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in tears and kicked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The wound caused Héctor Moren's reckless act in 15 minutes when 20-year-old Shaw went into the PSV.
Nine minutes he was treated in the field and a oxygen mask was needed before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double fracture of his legs and is now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe in the afternoon and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester when he's 18 years old, it's very difficult, but he plays fantastically, and then this happens.
When he was in the clothes, he also had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will take six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group phase.
I believe he's still playing this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty pile.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can assess for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly move on both legs.
Tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their reports, words can't say how destroyed I am, my path to recovery begins now and I come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw's injury in defeating the SVP
The English defender will have added motivation to the recovery in the form of a European championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very bad wound."
If any player leaves the field with such injury, each one is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a break of his legs in the fight for Mexico against Van Gaalowski in the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the seriousness of the injury, it's not good," Coca said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I saw only the ball that directed the other way, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched him, but I did not see the operation on Luke.
In the discussion for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
Player PSV Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
David Cameron certainly knows The Lorax better?
This is what every parent knows: When a child loves the book, it will not be long before he learns to remember it.
You can't be David Cameron, though.
To ask the children's schematics provider to name his favorite children's book, he chose the president of the Lorax government, a story from Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was hard to choose, says Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Laughter, funny, creative and with strong content, I liked reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I had never seen before."
Well, until then, in the following paragraph Cameron reportedly described the events of the books according to the 2012 movie extract, which added other characters and details to fill out the specific original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a house where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a comfort, the boy named Ted hopes he will get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," is the professional content of the book, which notes the object of love unknown Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it wasn't quite suspicious, the text added by Cameron is read as a summary lift of the Lorax movie, which is found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins by saying: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by a ghost, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a comfortable one, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an open-minded practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would meet the event of a book where the no-named young man would learn that the local nature was ravaging a gratifying tree by the industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the title Lorax, a twisted, built-in creature who "speaks for trees."
With the highest probability of such a relatively small PR task, an assistant who had never read Lorax a child 20 times in a piece.
Speaking Downing Street said the text probably came from Cameron's post.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text provided an employee of Cameron, but no further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of warning England, but he's still holding
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has chosen on this tour, I believe the repetition of the 3-0 defeat, which she suffered last in the trial series, is not likely enough.
I wouldn't exclude the guests' winnings either.
The page Alastair Cooka can be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in this plecking set and also collective thinking is strong; they do not bear the 2012 scars, only a youth positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown on the level of the trial series, it represents an aggressive possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth got off the team of England in the series experience and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze, because his chief coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks under difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are sentenced on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questions that led to the announcement, since — and I mentioned earlier — players are their best players.
Another couple of years later, Lyth was able to extend his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Let's hope that if he can get more running for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his position, even though his performance was not quite 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much test time the stick gets to prove itself is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance home and out.
The only thing you can resist is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this missed opportunity is already past.
Alex Hales is coming, and it's a sticker that I value very positively.
It's an x-factory cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, which did so little.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall composition of the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts off on the side of Cook, which would get another extra spinner while he'd keep four quicks, was overcome and I don't have an exception against her.
I don't understand why the strikemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 and there's no big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 trials before his performance in 2001.
At once, he succeeded for three centuries, and he didn't even look.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as an investment spinner, and when I had the chance to follow him, he was interested in me as a very influential young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — on average 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a plumber, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands and choose for young people.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Besides the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their training staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardenea, bats from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches may be a master's move.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experiences by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in the part of the white-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and an unmerciful spark.
I've always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and just like Mahela, he has the intelligence that can be used.
New voices in the dress, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes relax and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham Ben Stokes got a day off, just like Root got a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree with it, coaches and selectors don't create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
Brexit's campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unimaginable renegotiation strategy of David Cameron for maintaining Britain in the EU is emerging into further problems with every day past, even without the permission of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the head of the Workshop, or will come to TUC on Tuesday take the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corby and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat has recently explained how Europe is sinking in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British self-centered agendas, shared concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided not to do so, even if they were in the mood for social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolis, take a photo before a famous local monument, with or without local entrants, and then return home with the words that they win the union for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be in Europe – "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin – points out that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, a German-friendly officeman, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her position before it becomes bad for her, as it was for too long thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French Francis Holland faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how to break your legs using Selfie Brits, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want themselves because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign before the 2017 referendum in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, a hard friend.
"The renegotiation has solved the problem" and "British has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know for their own good how the float can be Fleet Street and how sceptical to the EU are pressure oligarch barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Ben in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in relation to 2:1.
They can vividly remember the name Boris Johnson, a brilliant Euro opportunist who made his name the Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his inhumanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of dolls not paying taxes, strangers hacking phones, and pseudo overseas departments who owned most of the big news.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a scared gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she can't get you to dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum routine since Blair accepted the principle of the EU's repealed constitution, which was overthrown by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and received a card of rejection.
The press never let him go, either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who had me in the Westminster for friends on Monday - I told him he shouldn't waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of re-accepting the strategy of the boycott Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake back then.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marre, whose chair at BBC on Sunday left.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I'll say, developing.
He claims to want to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people beyond the ferocious trend of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory's little Englishman can certainly join in.
The same was said by Hilary "Bemm, but not Bennite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his internal shell couldn't decide that Corby's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his old father fought on TV about his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But to fight for us to remain "in all circumstances" - Benin's phrase - according to everything McDonnell said, or what JC said to colleagues and Members at their private meeting on Monday evening,
Whatever background it is, a sensitive picture that Corbyn wants to share - do not forget, has touched me too - the discipline of the report remains important in the age of whole-day television broadcasting and especially in faith, the parlour of paranoia and betrayals to which the social media are
It is fair not to give Cameron a free entry into Europe which would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign, of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's basic exploitation of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past- is no longer just a question of esoteric debate between leftist dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is the central element of dogmatic exasperation.
As with his exploiting about NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end - foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital - they also have suspects - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I have been reminded of the Monday beginning of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise reviews of electronic public agency Public Health England
Government-funded agency statements that electronic cigarettes are 95 % safer than smoking have resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the launch of criticism of the evidence used in their report on electronic cigarettes by the Public Health England Agency (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "marginal" report last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the data volume and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The headliner in the expert journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinary chateau" last month, on which the PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who wrote for the BMJ questioned claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They pretend that the public could expect a claim by the PHE agency, which sounds "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people invited to draw up an analysis of the multi-criteria decision (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damage associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the proceedings were summarised in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one of the sponsors of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general allegedly had already received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the sustainability report, he said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not from the funding allegedly obtained earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
There is no reason for selecting panel members, but they contain several well-known electronic cigarettes champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting in PH was also attended by tobacco management.
The report emerges in this group "explanatoryly admitting," missing "solid evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers," it was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, stated that the claim in BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers will die because of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic cigarettes are small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows, and also what does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers of smoking.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year of smoking and smoking-related diseases cost NHS £2 billion a year.
With clear emphasis on current evidence - even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should end with East Enders, former Director Channel 4 claims
Former Director Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "put their right hand" for a hit show such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programs that are not created by other British television broadcasts.
He criticised BBC for putting in place public service programs, which are likely to follow only a handful of people, in difficult broadcasting times against its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years working on Channel 4.
"I fight the idea that BBC is providing and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the communication commission in the Upper House, as part of the discussion on the future of BBC.
If you maintain license fees that I am not sure are in the medium- and long-term horizon of good thinking, you should reduce the production of at least as regards programs that do not produce or impose on others.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The thought that no one else would send him out is a ridiculous joke, and it's incomprehensible.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regression tax should support programmes that can be financed without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, East Enders is another, and is understandablely made on the home floor.
Frankly, other channels would give them a peaceful right hand.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting services are.
I don't think that would even weaken BBC.
Johnson, a serial businessman who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told BBC that he felt guilty for pushing ratings "for the ambitious people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those who were former Executive Director Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC sells the show as East Enders.
Johnson said that even more flexible public service programs BBC "exceeds to BBC4, where quite often the amount cannot be measured, but they fulfil their authority and can argue when they are going to justify their cover mission to receive £4bn from license fees, "But of course we are doing all these ridiculous programs that no one is looking at."
They broadcast them at a time when nobody's watching them.
As for the licence fee, Johnson said to the commission: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value.
Of course, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who are 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they paid so much because they don't look at BBC that much.
Former Director Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said that BBC should review its Reithov mission in the sense of "information, education and entertainment."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as education - it was 1% television production and 0.1% on the radio - and should be taken as a model for public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, explain and entertain."
On the subject of the Elstein partnership, BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which were broadcast on television only by a harrow, and connect with commercial reporters, so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or the control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction the slides are moving.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small shins change direction at a time when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses function by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists have said that these worms are a great example of a new method called sonogenetics that uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates them outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, stated for the Guardian's journal that one day this method could replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the patient's brain is subjected to electrodes that stimulate the brain. For example, the method is used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
The patches usually do not respond to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction will be delivered when placed into a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then pass through the worms ’ body.
Increased ultrasound waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate cells with which they are connected, the report of Nature Communications.
In order to control the slide using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
Then, when he used ultrasound modified worms, the sound waves were reinforced by microbublins and moved to worms where modified motor neurons were switched on.
The new method is very similar to the optogenetics, an instrument that enables scientists to switch on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, was told that sonogenesis could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that must be sent by optical fiber to the required place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without limitation and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment for the treatment of neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that his method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin producing cells.
Illegal torture device - directly on your powder!
Adverts against the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-weapon market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drone!
Oaks on the legs that break the ankles!
Three-shots!
And electric damping pillows that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The happy voice and caricature metaphor leave no one doubt that this advertising on the world's largest fireworks is a sharp parade created for Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security of the International Veselice in ExCeL Centre in the London Docklands district.

But a stand-alone campaign is also carried out with posters on bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"An important announcement, Traveling to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" read one, using a font with a London metro mark with DLR links becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a trade fair with weapons will enter the DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
For 300 posters there are artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The collective name Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute throughout London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which allegedly "gets access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this air-posting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodys produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and professional assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to the spectators outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out in the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another of the anti-trafficking posters with health weapons traveling in the subway.
The video Amnesty was watched on Facebook for more than 100,000 people within 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working without charge on the fee and graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Liver would be surprised by the silent advertising about arms trade - saw an empty place in the calendar ExCeL - and thought, "Let's show them a campaign that is trying to avoid."
They were playing with the creation of more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding petricolors and animation, I have aimed to attract more people."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that it does not deal illegally with the torture facility on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic eufemistic products.
In the press release, Saab discovered an order from the U.S. Army to "at the firefighting AT4CS RS."
This includes a "one-sided head that provides wonderful effects behind the shooting inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life at Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an ignorant nineteen-year-old boy, still believing in bartage and moral relativism, but until now I have equipped myself with the tense smiles of those I've been running - and frequent, prolonged complaints to others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to college can move from slightly to the nerves of going to absolutely alarming.
It's easy to talk: To tell people where you've been, if you've taken a year's break, which you've been thinking about Corby, and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHA's flowers, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask yourself and show interest.
It's a conversation, and it'll help you find people you like, and those you don't have to deal with even if your races were in one fire and they'd throw out the extinguishers.
Leave people room.
People's rooms often change to drinking receptions, movie evenings and public places, but they're also rooms where people dress up and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting high and being in a relationship.
The introverts on high will soon come.
Your room should be a safe haven, yet a lot of wheels change into an outdoor walking culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to a lifelong friendship.
It could be hell for someone who needs to offer.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so that I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when he's tired of socializing - and maybe write him a lockdown.
When it comes to knocking, you're talking.
One boy in my college used to know that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He's seen a few things.
Make friends by cooking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of the bakery mania, knocking on a stranger's door, and performing with a plated cake seems immeasurably less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've got something for you, now smile while I ask myself personal questions."
Offering domestic feelings is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and maybe everything will end in a way that will bring your face to a pleasant surprise.
It's, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and ink are likely to disrupt others' sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student colleges.
The theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is the drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double-check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they get mad inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little bit more grown-up than my roommate, who exchanged her milk by means of a washbasin to punish thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not only about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could keep the drum and bass quiet, because they were 3 at night and had a letter in the morning.
Their answer was to strengthen the music.
When they finally shut up at 5:00 in the morning, she let them sleep quietly for two hours and then released her own music, closed the door and went to her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future went to the same college as you?
On the contrary, would it not be embarrassing if you were mistaken for your future roommates, slept together, and had to see each other every day and perhaps also took control of your friends?
Of course, you will not give up your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not your future though, try at least to talk to your weaknesses.
In a touching moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in his unlocked room, there is only a thin border between fun and joke.
A good joke's funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn valuable and fun lessons about their security by hiding something from them - never destroy any room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them keys to the bottle with the water you then pour into the freezer - but never stick their things to their ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins, despite the real prospects for the future.
Eve had been through a painful period of pregnancy with a seven - year - old Vite today.
His father broke up with her and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
With the situation, I managed relatively fast - I was looking forward to the child and looking for a positive one.
Uncertainty and being alone with the child, I was trying not to get hurt.
And I was sure hoping that we wouldn't stay alone for a long time, but Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
She had already met on the Internet at the older Vask's chat room, where they started talking about their favorite movies.
Your Eve and Vítka even brought home from the womb, but the role of the own father was not too short.
"For some time then he got out of the program," said Eva in the documentary series Four in the 3rd.
The reason for the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for happiness for the second attempt.
The care of Vítka and the financial security of the family was supported by part-time work and by the great help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of being responsible for a stranger’s child eventually betrayed Eve’s attachment to Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítka's second birthdays, and he now understands Vaska as his dad, and that's how he addresses him.
Even though your son has two grown daughters, fatherhood in his 60 ’ s is taking advantage of his words and is also more devoted to his children.
Besides Vitka, another two-year-old Leontynka and finally two-year-old Leontynka came to them.
"Yours entered our family somehow naturally, perhaps even by the fact that my mother never talked much to me about relations," she thinks.
Any place?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born with a cesarean cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnant cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of biliary acids, which then appear in excess of the amount of blood pregnant and are particularly evidenced by exposure.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn child, who is threatened by premature birth and death, in the mother after giving birth most of the time, voluntarily.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evina and Vascha, although they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department where Vaskova's niece also works, who came to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and right after I moved from the JIP to the room I had her with me, describing the stress period after Eve's birth.
She spent 20 days in the womb until the doctors chose to release the babies, which in the meantime managed to reach a limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the children to be gathered in Eve’s womb was not a joy.
"I've been crazy about my wife and kids," recalls a tough moment in the department of a six-week four-way mother.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, among other things because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
But that was not the end, and the doctors let Eve and the twins in the house.
The stories of four pregnancy and childbirth broadcasts ČT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45.
A total number of families can be reduced.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to cope with electric double and tight conditions.
The house did not increase, but yours made Eve happy by installing a gas cook to make her food more comfortable for six people.
If it's worse, we'll take care of a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are especially aware of family affection and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or mercy of the home.
For the time being, we've been doing a lot better than we expected.
Although the disorder is hidden up in a small space and we sometimes cross over the baby, but at least we're all close, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side on every situation.
The work of the wax lighting device in the film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why they sometimes go to Prague streets as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, care for family finances and children physically manages how long will it take?
"I realize that because of our age difference, I will once be the one who will live this family," admits Eva on a level when asking about the future.
She'd like to go back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly an employer.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can deal with a cab, joke about a nice blonde.
Apple's got no effect.
For everything, there's plenty of displays.
A more efficient processor, a camera with a larger resolution, a stronger chess or display recognizing the power of the touch, these are in the short favor of the recent ninth generation iPhones.
The last two then also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus.
The boring trend of Apple was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly against previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight of the differences in the failure of the news was, however, quite negligible.
But it doesn't pay far for the new iPhones.
In contrast to last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, weight grew in a smaller model of 14 grams, in a larger one of 20 grams.
On the one hand, last year's affair with the shift in Apple's pockets suffered a lot.
The paper is thus made of a more durable aluminium alloy of 7,000, which was also promulgated by weight.
But there's a lot more impact on her.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology for the news, which allows displays to recognize the power of the touch.
To this end, another layer of capacity sensors had to be provided.
The weight of new iPhone displays has increased more than doubled compared to previous generations.
In the case of a smaller iPhone, from the original 12 grams to the 29 grams, in the case of a larger one, from 19 to the 40 grams.
In iPhone 6s, the display is the most difficult component to use.
The weights of only 143 grams are then also achieved in this news thanks to the pollinating bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, then, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed against the previous one.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen in the display.
Weight 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical will appear when used.
The first users will be able to test this by Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhones 6s and 6s Plus is started in selected countries.
Are the hairs of the champions breakfast for tens of thousands of years?
In Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists succeeded in finding an interesting possibility.
They discovered traces of modern man-dwelling from different times, including wall painting, tool residue, and so on and so on.
In layer 23A, which is according to instruments dated to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered something that reminds us very much of the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In the place, there were traces of corn, which apparently went through the production process today of such popular fibers.
It gets wet first today, then drys, removes the package, so to speak, then washes and dissolves.
In the cave Paglicci was able to discover the grain that was all warm or spicy, and then apparently split between the two mill stones - at least testify to the traces of use on the two stones in the cave.
Thus, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for the magazine PNAS that a complete process of the production of strawberries would take place in the cave, but the similarity is really very imaginable.
We also have no evidence of how the fibers could eat, but the idea that it was with some liquid and perhaps even heat is, of course, offered entirely logically.
At the same time, it is a very interesting document of how intensively people used cereals long before agricultural production.
If the fibre interpretation is correct, the oldest fibers have gone to agriculture for about 20,000 years.
New station reporting in the Transport Company of Brno.
So once again I listened to the name of the stop in the trolley bus: Hnusáčkova, Prezraz, Frazova, Sprateká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting to men was somewhat less understandable than when the stops were reported to women.
Women's voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
DPMB, however, argues that these voters chose their own passengers - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly picked it from the studio tapes made in total silence, which of course sounded quite different from the frame of the bus engine.
They've been living in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops to remember, so I don't need this report, but the strangers who don't recognize in Brno and for which these reports are intended in particular can be confused and can say to the final ones, where they failed, that the stop they were supposed to be on was not at all reported.
Perhaps the choice of voters - but better again voters - should be made again, and this time a subcolored with the usual transport noise and engine noise, in which the conjugation of the speaker in the bus almost disappears.
So we don't have to continue to listen to the names of the water stations Herspice, Shmir, or Ponorna on the crippling side that I went to in Komarov.
I guess my old ear didn't get worse all of a sudden during the one day when the voter changed.
Before that day, I understood that report quite well.
Good morning, Chief's colleague.
From the tape recorders.
Today, hardly anyone knows what the biggest and smartest party governments were called complex checks.
I let myself remember that.
The bus was late.
I ran into the dispatcher's office at the moment the radio said it was just seven hours.
"You're lucky you didn't fight with your boss's partner, came a minute before you, and it doesn't seem like he's in the mood," said the dispatcher, while I was writing in the coming book.
Thanks, I'll take care of it.
Write me that I'm going to check out the crossroads for a little mechanization.
It won't work, but today's a check.
Everyone's out of this shit when they're scared.
What exactly is this about?
"But you'll see," the dispatcher took care of.
You'll be next.
I ran out for a walk.
That's when the front door opened and the chief appeared.
Stirred, with a stone face, in a perfectly falling parallel.
"Good morning, Mr. Chief," I cordially greeted and quickly turned on two buttons of the same line.
"Good morning," she said, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, vicious tone that the old man responded to.
"You're playing," I was greeted by the engineer Eva, the older lady, who I loved very much.
I think she was even the boss before her partner sat down.
There's a check, and you'll be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but nobody wants to talk about them.
They'll be there once in three years, they'll have to all of them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out a file with periodic reports and that's the phone.
"This is Holcman, come to me right away," the chief's voice rang.
What's poisoning?
Now we met and nothing..." I missed, but nobody answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good day, comrade of the chief, I came to your order," I reported, barely entered the chief's office.
The chief sat behind the writing table and looked at some tape.
"Mechanist's partner," he said after he didn't raise his head and he kept looking through the register carefully, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the tape at the table, washed himself in the armchair, and burned himself on me with a normal, unpleasant, evil, vicious look.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the mayor commended me for having worked very well in these few months and for being very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the tank at a distance.
What about this?
I realize that you're a track distance technique, and that's why you have to act.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I've noticed that I've been using such a greeting since I was a kid, that I've been so raised, and that I don't see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red shark on the sidewalk.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the intruder.
Besides, you're still messing with the superiors.
You'll say "sir" and the second "friend" again.
But I'm not a captain for you, but a fellow chief.
Employees are employers' partners, top trammasters are top trammasters!
Remember that kindly!
I'm sorry, sir... a colleague of the Chief, but... I greeted you with a customary civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with it... and it's an honor to work, or a friend... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," said the chief in the cold, who calmed down a bit.
But it's still going to be.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension in that chair up there.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his advantage, it didn't look good with the person concerned.
For a while, he was giving me a cold, peeky look, and I was looking for the words that I would answer.
I was also ashamed of his elevated stature.
He was only a few years older and was playing for a god, actually a fellow god.
Animal, horny, authoritarian, arrogant, how it was right now.
He's been executed by everyone.
Wake up, he's the chief.
Actually, not all, the president of the party organization, like all the parties, but also the non-participants, were there.
But the chief was fond of many, especially those with whom he could apply his superiority.
Right now, he shot me for a complete piece of shit.
I've been thinking about my ass and it's been a long time before I shot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the creek anymore, so I could continue to be a janitor.
What would I use for two kids?
And that's a loose fight!
I was in trouble, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all you can do so far," finished the chief's audit and began to look through the record that he had already had in his hand again.
They called me in half the 12th.
Everyone from the office was already there and asked questions what and how, they answered that yes, it would be good.
Just Jožin said in a bit as his former habit was that they couldn't all throw us out, because the job would have to be a friend of the chief with his own loyal ones, and that's not a threat.
The word "sex" was pointing out, as if he knew what the old man had shot me for in the morning.
There was a nice break in the headquarters.
Association of the Chief of Staff at his writing table and at the long advisory table of the other members who were to decide whether to be an official or not.
Chief of Staff, President ROH, personal secretary, Special Rapporteur, something in a way that contradicts the war, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, president of the party organisation.
I knew him from my uncle.
A simple track worker, he was rubbing his fists or throwing his eyeballs.
But also a former guard.
It was heard that there was no fun with him this time, rather than a beautiful beast.
Bad language said he went to school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't have anything.
And when the criminal was canceled, he ended up at the dumpster.
But a companion, yes, a companion was metal!
The chief told me to sit down.
There was a little soul inside me, an inseparable jaw in my neck.
The Board has read out the findings of the Civilian Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a business family, I'm married, two kids and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I've thought about it, and I've had a little better breath.
Then the party's street organization's judgment.
He copied the judgment from the civil committee, if both of them were written by the same man.
But then it came!
Parents of long-term members of the Party refused to submit to the Audit Board and subsequently stepped out of the Party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharp.
The cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief said he should continue.
It's been worse.
I was a member of the city's SSM committee, and there I was won for the party's candidates.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and married, except for the National Committee, I also had a church.
I've let the party down in the worst way.
That's why I was expelled from among her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother died, and I arranged a church funeral, even though it was a former party member.
By doing so, I have shown a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the chair was counted, only the peeping of the boss's pencil to the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was looking at me, and I wanted to be a lot too far away.
Then I kept repeating in my mind, "The Communists - the Overwhelmed, the Communists - the Overwhelmed." What did I get?
Why didn't I stay with the cowards?
I could fix the gaps without any fucking check.
But now?
The career of a janitor took her place before she started.
Back to the castle?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the boss will be out for an hour.
"A mate, how did you check out the brother-in-law here?" he interrupted the tense quiet chief's question on the chair.
Well, according to the previous employment verdict.
Do you have him here?
Obviously, it wasn't overtime.
On the edge, he's squeezing the pot, squeezing up nervously, like he's been checked himself.
He hollered and handed the chief some paper.
"But," said the chief with a sign of beauty, which was often the premonition of thunderstorms.
At first glance, the self-esteemed praise, studied the industry, worked as a bailiff, met the standard on an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But it's a big deal.
Where did you get that judgment, mate?" he turned again to the cadre who felt that it was beginning to turn against him and that he might not even have to be a cadre very soon.
This is where my partner gave it to me when she came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to our house, he went to the corner of the cottage," the chair bluffed.
And there's no need for convictions. His guy was like an add-on, so I put him in the file.
"So, when you're entered into a technical function, you've had enough of this paper carrier," said the chief.
The cadre was nervous and had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later," he concluded the matter with the chief and the headquarters obviously relieved himself.
For the time being, it's settled.
"What's the matter with you, buddy?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, it's over!
My eyes were darkened, I felt hot.
He followed the suit and the charges, and I knew that I was the most stubborn creature in the world who did not deserve the lesser mercy.
That by undermining the incomplete judgement, I failed to understand why the judgement was incomplete when I received it from the factory headquarters.
I am also an anti-socialist living that, during the construction of real socialism, supports the roots of religious darkness, ba, even participates in them.
That there was a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and I've been praying quietly for it to end.
I don't care.
I don't care if I fly out of the mechanic's place.
I don't care if they take the doll.
It's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people I was in the eyes of the chief's friend.
"That would be enough, comrade of the chief," the president of the party suddenly called and interrupted the chief's Levites.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he just did the stupid thing!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, Chief's friend!
What could be worse for a young man than if we closed the door to him for a while!
To reopen him, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is this how he was counted, or did he use the phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young companion must also get our chance!
Chances to prove he's changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him if it's not you, my friend, the chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, a bit of a wrong companion, in his efforts to repair!
It's your civic duty that no one will ever get rid of you!
Actually, it's a party duty, too, for all of us.
Here the shipmate must see that the party didn't forget about him.
That as a loving mother she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president was done, no one even listened.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
"I fully agree with you, my fellow president," the chief iced himself in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me make a deal, you'd hear that I was just going to make that conclusion.
They all agreed with their heads, but it was obvious to them that they did not believe his word.
"That's how I was confirmed for the function of the independent care rapporteur on basic funds," I yelled when I returned to the office and cried out.
Besides Eve's engineers, they were all at lunch.
Those little ones listened to my unconcerned view of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could get some coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she put water on the cook and was about to cook.
In the meantime, she talked about cadre practices.
Like one judgment, often full of praise, they put a man into his hand, and the other one, where there's dirt, they'll send a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the sidewalk at the sidewalk, so the guys at the factory didn't know where to send it.
What about our chair?
He's just worried about where to eat or drink, and that's how it turned out.
"He's got it from an old man," she said maliciously.
He certainly won't like it today.
Look out for him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
What about the party president?
Basically a far worse leader, no lumberjack.
It's zero from a shrink with a lot of power.
Water for coffee started to boil and the office filled the smell of freshly washed coffee.
I threw a piece of sugar into the cane, and the cane mixed a hot drug.
I guess I'm from the worst out there.
Now it's not gonna work out for me, and the next check is in three years.
Anyway, my partner's boss won't forget me today.
It came out in the anthology of TRATI II LITERATIA in the EPIKA loading plant
The symbol of the village is alive.
The windmill's circle over Chlum is turning again after years.
It's visible far away, because it's located 15 meters high.
People from a wide area call him "the wind on Chlum."
For the municipality, 150 inhabitants have become even one of the elements of the general mark that the municipality has gained to the occasion of the clash of parents in 2010.
"We then asked for the sign and the wind on the sign of course we wanted to have, knows it all around," said Mayor Jiří Maskek.
Chlum's wind pump is a local technical memory.
It is also a memento of the present: it recalls the time when the present people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the last century was rare.
Until 1910, false representatives decided to resolve, which was then settled up to half the 1980s.
In the village at the turn of the Čichov, they had a deep cold of seven meters.
Three years later, they completed a steel construction with an air pump, which was pumped into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the right church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Hranic at the cost of 2,400 kroner," says the monumental inscription on the underground reconstruction of the building.
A few repairs and falls of the wind cycle were performed in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the battle for water began to be written.
The wind pump has already remained only a non-functional general symbol and a left-hand rarity.
The Dominant was released at the family reunion this year.
Until 2008, Chlumští decided that the windwheel would be repaired and brought back into operation.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced by an average of half a meter.
The wheel was placed on the stove, but still the same year it had to be carried down.
The replica producer did not choose the suitable material and the wheel should not resist the wiring of the wind.
After that, the hypocritical ruler had been resting under the roof for several years.
However, since June, the wheel on the high station is turning again.
On the occasion of the family conflict, the municipality had the wheel’s replica adjusted and re-set it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pulls water from the cold only to the overcrowded blind shoulder.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the cold.
It was at least empty.
"In the autumn, then, we will unplug the windwheel from the pump in the bag again," explained Mayor Mask.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the windwheel has been obtained to the general mark, however, is the only one of these species throughout the Highlands.
A similar element in the brand has respect for local technical monuments such as Chwalkovici and Green Mountains in Vyškovsk, Kuželovi in Hodoninsk, Partutovici in Perorovsk or the Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing bad, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed to the support of Tripoli Goian.
"I remember the victory against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," 34-year-old Goian laughed at the pre-emptive press conference.
This time we were trained by George Hagi, it was a pity we lost.
I hope I'll aim for Sparta right now.
Just because we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who won 60 matches for the Romanian representation, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a trail, he's going to head for the expeditions of Spartan offensives.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says about the Greek struggle of the Spartan Hybsh.
And they know in part what they can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie who played in Romania with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, too, said Goian.
The other footballers of the Prague club didn't mention it, so the direct question came to mind whether David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta, knew.
Goian laughed and looked at Czech journalists with a slightly calculated view.
"Why are you asking me this?"
After a while, the silence went down.
We saw some videos, and I noticed Sparta is playing a lot of teams.
He's got a really good player.
And Lafata?
Nothing bad, but I don't know anyone but Fataie.
The spartans know very well about Goian.
"My experience from major clubs, one can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, is such an organizer of their game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Heikal.
Goian's got the best summer yet, but he can boast of a very interesting football life story.
He was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both of the Manchester United and City, from Steauy, but he joined the Italian Palermo, also playing for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a great team, regularly playing European Cups, peres about victory in the Czech League.
He's a favorite for me in this game, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I'm in a room with a Slovenian barrister Tomáš Košik, who is delighted to meet a rival from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new residence should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading with company shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In relation to the move of the group of shareholders, consideration is given to the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company completes a prospectus of the securities that it submits to the Czech National Bank for approval at the earliest time.
The transfer of the holding and related transfers of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction involving only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered in this operation to the public or to new investors.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - it will collapse the company and its shareholders will decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any tender for shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the stock exchange.
The Czech TV objectivity test in information about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the reports of the Czech mainstream media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news report of the Czech TV.
How did she survive?
When journalists at the faculty learn about how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's Czech TV Event.
The migrant crisis was about 80% of the news.
Until the first minute that the ČT informed of the riots at the Serbian-Madjan border and the attacks of migrants on the police, euphemistically called for patience - throwing stones and attacking metal rods) - now the now pro-migration propaganda - examine the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organisations that criticise the poor treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - story of the integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Escapers not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Travel of refugees - ČT consistently uses expressions of fugitive or refugee rather than migrants.
In particular, the fact that ČT is used in illustrative photographs is used consistently only and only for small children and women.
At the same time, she said in the same broadcast that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that does not have periods of communist agitation.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I first broke into a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only resident.
I've got fish moving to the back of the toilet.
Fish domestic, resin with a change not perfect, i.e., that unwrought passage from the shell to the brooch and youth looks like an adult unit, it's just tiny and it's growing gradually.
They were disgusting to me, and I refused to kill them.
First hand and later both chemical.
Socialist drugs on their disposal provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclon B.
Or else?
But it was a success.
Later, I made a similar decision with Pharaoh.
A box with some sort of juvenilizer that the ants brought into the nest and then he wouldn't allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went by, we became objects of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to think that they have the same right to life as we do.
Besides, I've had experience in life that interference with the ecosystem doesn't lead to success and one can replace another.
The truth is, I'd probably never have to mess up with the blush and the bunnies to get worse by killing their karma.
In the new residence, we agreed with our partner that if the fish don't fall behind our necks, let the wolves eat the lost skin in peace, some of the invisible breeds, and so on.
Their peaceful existence has been disrupted by spiders over time.
It was a common kind of cutlery who had lived on the roof for a long time.
We thought he was living from occasional mosquitoes and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found that he was living mainly with fish and that he was probably keeping their numbers in a breezy state.
With a confidential regular contact, we have found that she is a female in every need.
Because we've been witnesses of romantic agreements with a partner about a third smaller, how carefully the fibers of the spiders are rubbed off so that it won't be eaten before it reaches the strained bath.
It took about three days before they moved and didn't respond to our controls.
Under the toilet table, where loving toys were played, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
After that, the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They're almost gone.
They were bitten by their mother, part by another.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she went somewhere else or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the roof again.
The truth is, something smaller, probably the daughter of those toilet residents.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior, and by moving under the toilet, she assessed our non-attack as friendship.
The numerical state of the fish was somewhat reduced again, and the spider was quietly watching its usual activities to provide food.
He hasn't changed to our ecosystem all year round.
Our daughter, by the way, had grown up when using a nightstand was already a shame.
We've tolerated it so far, but we've already had a lot of time to pour out his contents.
We've offered her more and more to use the toilet.
However, her daughter found an excuse for keeping her habit in that spider she saw very well in the feeding.
Our words about seeing spiders, luck in my house, didn't take it at all.
With tears and tears, she forced her night nurse.
There wasn't any leftovers.
There was a time when a spider had to report in the interest of the daughter's developmental movement.
It's left on me.
He was taken to the glass and shown through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I've been hanging out with him like a friend, but after so long a life together, I felt awful as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that fish would start to appear more often and would start to multiply by a geometric sequence.
The world's a wonder, a week, two, none of us showed up there.
I started speculating about the reason.
I was wondering if the spider was there after the ants' pattern, that the toilet environment wasn't as good for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they're moving again.
I had to come up with another theory of the cause of their disappearance, and I found that their connection to spiders had to have a cause when they didn't see him hiding somewhere else and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some fearsome reaction.
You're saying that I'm not making any illusions about their vision.
Some light showed a faintness, but that they would react to hand-holding or quick movement, not.
My daughter's going to the bathroom all the time.
I think she's forgotten about the night.
There's nothing left but to attract some spider again.
I'm sending my wish to the ether, and I hope they didn't lock me up after that execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use the B-Cyclone.
The disserter of Albert Einstein's ancestors, who enriched the world.
The years of a brilliant scientist of the past century are likely to never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to sink into everything so deep that the fertilization was always amazing.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
In the minds of the people, he introduced, above all, his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic relation.
It cannot also be mentioned his explanation of the photo effect or idea of quantum electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of acquaintances the popular theory of relativity is so confusing that for closer acquaintances they prefer to choose easy models.
It's not easy, though.
However, it would not be Albert Einstein, if he did not find this in a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: the hour near your lover seems to be a minute; the minute in the hot oven seems to be an hour - and that is relative.
I've allowed myself from his entire sheet of famous quotes to choose these ten that have literally taken me.
Smart people are trying to solve problems, genius is trying not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human nonsense.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiment can ever prove that I was right.
But the only thing that can ever prove I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break up then than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in the Third World War, but in the fourth, it's gonna be bricks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
To know little is dangerous and to know a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I'd spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it and 5 minutes solving it.
The most difficult thing in the world to understand is income tax.
To conclude, I can't let Einstein's formula go to the definition of success: If we take A for success, the pattern applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlinsk are waiting for changes of 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we think that this whole year all four are holding in black numbers," noted happy Heitman Stanislav Misak.
The total profit of regional facilities is now about 32 million crowns.
The share is mainly higher than the insurance premiums, which are equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroméríž, Vsetina, Uhersk Hradští and Zlina, this makes it possible to build buildings that will total nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
It's been a long time since we bought the main equipment.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them the top health care is not available, the plans have justified the regional health substitute for Lubomír Nečas.
He's looking forward to the changes in all the hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospital next year.
In Vsetina, new internal pavilion suppliers are now being selected for nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a planned dialysis facility in Cromère.
Uherska Hradistä wants to add a new interior to the open central pavilion by about 200 million this year.
And a long-delayed construction of a new central income and interior will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, it is a fundamental and often biggest change in recent years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said Veera Prousková, for example, the director of the Svetin hospital.
The five-storey building is to be ready in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurological, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes, which are particularly familiar with patients, will affect all regions.
For example, new buildings replace those where many patients are in one room, on the floor they need only one toilet, the beds are inhospitable, the windows are inconvenient, and the health care professionals do not have the right conditions for work.
"For example, our interior was built fifty years ago and now it's at the edge of its life," said the director of the Zlinn Hospital Pavel Calabek.
Within a few years it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected to emergency income.
Doctors and patients will thus have all emergency departments in one place, in addition in new spaces.
The same model already has a semi-finished Uher Hradiste.
Central income is already standing and will be in the interior within three years.
"We will pay for the building from the loan and partly from our own resources," explained Petr Słádek.
This hospital can afford its own funding as the only one in the country.
The profits are still the highest, and they didn't even get to the loss two years ago, when maybe the lynch hospital was facing almost two million losses.
"We have good contracts with insurance, excellent performance, we raise revenues and manage costs effectively throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who has an economy of concern.
Improvements are also being made in patients at a borderline hospital.
Over a period of ten to fifteen years, new appliances and reconstructions of up to half a billion crowns will go to repair.
By this year, the final repair of the catchment station will begin, then the dialysis facility will start, if necessary, the building for the new magnetic resonant.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD), after consulting his European colleagues, complains that the other states of the Czech Republic are pressuring quotas to redeploy refugees, but reject any discussion.
It also points out that so far no one has explained to him how assigned refugees in the Czech Republic should maintain themselves if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get the answer, and that's why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you have reached at the meetings of the Ministers of the Interior and abroad of the European Union?
We don't agree with mandatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants like salt or flour.
They're living beings who have some vision, some direction, some relative.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were redistributiond.
We can't imagine.
We didn't get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, the African trust fund and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we say this is the way.
But to say the quotas will solve everything?
We've solved forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in this area?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost nobody wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
The ambitions of other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their country of destination are gaining asylum, but the interest of people from this migratory wave, that is, Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want us, but fifteen hundred people have already made a commitment to embrace us.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept them this way more?
We made a commitment to accept 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even in the 1500s, there are 1,100 people with whom we deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come into our detention facility and we'll treat them the same way as those we've caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe whether we can hold back people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That means they'll come to our territory with registration, and if there's an agreement that isn't yet, it can happen that we won't even hold those 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they'll go back to Germany when they come.
If we can keep them during the asylum procedure, we can deal with them in the asylum procedure.
If Syria, Eritrea, is a citizen, almost 98 per cent of European statistics provide international protection.
Then they will get the documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people are going to end up in target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will move in.
This is the second project that is currently underway, and we have only progressed in that we are discussing with the churches the possibility of being able to help them get employment, housing and so on.
But it's a race on a very long track.
You said the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does it offer no solidarity step that would block the debate?
And what exactly do you think a solidarity step is going to be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany encourages all Syrian migrants to come to them, the report will spread in order of hours throughout all camps throughout Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's offering another migratory wave to Germany because they just don't want us.
We believe that the road is the protection of the external borders - just those migratory waves to heal, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Make it clear they don't have a chance.
Last year alone, there were 50,000 Kosovoes in Germany.
From secure Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representations.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to economic needs, then those fifty percent of what social systems are wasting on them today could be refugees.
On the other hand, the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day was twelve.
Where does it come from to increase border controls?
We were afraid of getting caught in hundreds of people's order.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we keep will return to Austria in seven days.
We're doing it by default.
They're the only people who take us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely unnecessary story.
So where's the break point?
Must be a thousand a day?
I think it's supposed to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three days after each other, we're running out of capacity so that there's going to be a crisis plan.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately summon an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If this situation were to arise, the government may de facto sit down immediately and by a resolution it would decide to strengthen the police on the army, let's give it to the customs administration, if any, on the prison service.
The country variant is an exceptional state that has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it's going this far.
You realize that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have only the Schengen border and only at the airport.
I don't know what should happen to make this happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread fearsome information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary or Hungary, testifies more to the fact that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration stream to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then be a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would touch it very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of debts at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent a failure.
Soccer Slavia paid off her debts.
The footballers were also waiting for their money.
Soccer Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Nearly three months after about 20 million crowns had submitted a proposal to Online Services from the Pacific Samoa.
The legal representative of Slavie Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl over a few hours that he should not report a fall.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Shimana.
Apparently from new owners to the club, the money has arrived, and that's for the last time.
This also proves that Slavie's statement before Tuesday's trial - the top club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, sent debt tens of millions of crowns.
"All was replaced between 11 September and 15 September," the legal representative Slavie Mládková said.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, Slovenian representative Milan Ivan or Czech treasurer Maria Litch.
Slavia also paid agent Alexander Losenick a fee.
On Friday, the club also paid the city's 10th Prague debt.
Part of the insolvency dispute thus remains de facto only claims that Slavie opposes.
Either the club doesn't have a commitment at all, or there's a court dispute about it.
However, in the event of the loss of these disputes, we are prepared to pay the amount.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can report with the statement from the account," said Judge Mládková.
"All that was after payment is repaid," the Younger said and added that the unpaid are only unpaid or dissatisfied commitments.
It is also true that the judge will not decide in the next few days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed proof that she actually paid the debts.
Afterwards, all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to continue on the third November.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but in writing after it.

FastMig X is the latest generation of inverter exchange sources.
The combination of peak technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular structure brings benefits and fast return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final composition is always configured according to customer requirements.
And anything, from welding construction steel after welding special alloys, as well as from welding rough materials after welding thin plates, from applications in the workshops to welding in the shipyards.
The incredible amount of leverage curves, simple adjustment and expansion of the leverage source enables a quick response to change requirements, leading to a reduction of the simples, to the need to stop the supply and to more productive leverage.
FastMig X enables welding through peak welding processes, developed by Kempi, which ensure higher productivity and quality welding.
It ceases to waste time and does not come to waste material or repair faulty jokes.
Flexibility is ensured, less simple, more sweating and higher profit.
It's this year's news that had a premiere in Nitra, where she also got gold medals.
We are very concerned about this, because it confirms the product's exceptionalness.
The world's leading manufacturers can embellish similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X belongs to the world's tip.
For the interested parties, it is certainly also pleasant to add time periods that move around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we've already linked the first contacts that are definitely expanding after the Brno Fair.
We have been his regular participants for over 20 years and almost always our business results are better than before him, he emphasises for the company ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, who runs the Kemppi shop in Plzi.

The blank was built so that it wouldn't fail.
But it would cost half a billion more, says a company expert who designed the tunnel.
The blanks have gone even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex was capable of being built so that there were no two land failures in Prague Stromovce, the producer director of Satra, who is the main projector of the tunnel, Alexandr Butović.
He said that on Wednesday afternoon at the tunnel's newspaper tour.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went down safer, but costs grew exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, yet the country has only gone a few steps from where it began to develop a safer and more careful method.
"If the measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a crater emerged in Stromovce, and in 2010 the soil fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is too expensive, the weekly Euro said.
According to the original purpose, the construction was to amount to SEK 17 billion.
When we add VAT, which has jumped twice during the construction period, you have eleven billion.
If you join in technology, land purchases and engineering, valuation and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer from 37 again to so far, says Bélohlav
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

Profits FedExu mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results in the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of annual profits due to low demand for freight transport and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers on holiday.
The shares of the company fell by about 2.5 per cent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the middle opening.
FedEx states that it expects a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a 20 cent reduction from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced view comes despite an average interest rate increase of 4.9 per cent, which appears in January. 4, and higher supplements for the land transport of heavy or large packages which start in November.
The company stated that it still expects profit growth against the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The President of the Representation and Director-General of Fred Smith said that the company "has conducted a strong performance despite the poorer economic conditions than expected, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced on the day after the UPS rival company stated that the plan is to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 additional workers, which is probably the same as last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx won $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Markets grew by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts from Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by a decrease in the priority international shipping, which has led to the stagnation of revenues in its Express Unit.
But boom in online shopping boosted the results of the FedEx Earth Unit.
In the last quarter, land income grew by 29 per cent, but operating profits were essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profits decreased in the freight trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-trading about an hour before opening, FedEx's share decreased by $3.85, or by 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a decrease of 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent under the June 11th record.
At its most anticipated meeting over the years, the Federal Reserve Lawyers spend this week two days set at 27 feet of the long Honduras mahogany table and decide whether or not it was time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
Depending on them at one end of the central bank's ornamentation, the two-guarded sitting room will be a wall painting by the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to give the economic interests of the people over everything else.
The Central Bank has a double charge from Congress: maximising American employment and maintaining the lower prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Feds have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term of office: financial stability.
And this third functional period could be too close to the foreseeable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the US economy is ready to set off at the end of 2008.
Although most data show robust economic growth, recent turmoil in the world financial markets could already scare the careful Fed by adding to the uncertainty by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - and nothing more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will first of all be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piezza, the main economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a pretext to not increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is already giving them sufficient reason to wait on," she said.
There is no consensus about what Fed will do, which is the cause of the nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Blomberg predicted an increase in the rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of increase.
This would indicate a decrease in the stock market if the Fed would increase the rates, only if the policy failed with the promise that the further increase would be disregarded.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The meeting was launched with the expectation that the Fed policy will keep rates this week at rest, says John Lonski, the main economist in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did so, "they would have to go to extremes in their programme statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so that they don't get panicked."
Other experts claimed that the increase in interest rates would calm down financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Fed was on a good track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first step in slow strengthening the currency conditions that would confirm the economic recovery force in the USA.
Yelena said that, in spring and early summer, she expects an increase in interest rates this year, despite complaints from liberals, that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation has slowed in August, the labour market has seen strong growth this year.
The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1% in the previous month, which is the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that Fed considers to be full employment.
Remuneration benefits have shown signs of pick-up.
And even though inflation continues to be under 2% of the central bank's annual target, Fed's policy claims that the temporary effect of oil prices was significantly lower.
The economy "can balance with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the leading economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets all over the world began to disappear at the end of last month after China was devaluing its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by up to 16% below its record value in May when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market is somewhat reflected in this month and Dow is now losing only about 10% of the May peak.
To the political factors, Fed's uneasy situation on the market adds a complex calculation when it starts to increase the interest rate.
"In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the Chinese economy's weakness in the past few weeks, there would be an increase in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, head researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed.
Now it predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on regarding the latest developments in China," said Oliner.
The health situation of the global economy is not one of Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, Fed became the currency authority of the whole world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The only sign of then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "spray" their monetary expansion on the market has started cracking all over the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, it can be expected that Fed's representatives are also monitoring developments elsewhere, but also are working with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for wealth-management of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of overhauled movements in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations."
Lacker, who voted in favour of the creation of an open market federal committee policy, which was pressuring an increase in rates, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions "I through limited identification effects on growth in the USA," Lacker said.
About a year later, Fed's representatives turned these jokes.
The Fed should give priority to concerns about financial stability only during the major crisis, as was the market downturn in 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England’s fixing rate committee.
The latest wave is not even approaching this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates, because markets have been fragmented," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese neighborhood.
Yes, Chinese neighborhood
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often designated as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not a Thai district.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian cuisine, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
Even the car part is available if you need some motor oil.
The store is massive and will take you over an hour before you cross all the streets.
If you're hungry from all of this shopping, go to the food at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal store (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different pick-up places.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in large.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The expansion of the meat is great, for example, fish - the employees behind the desk wash you and eat it, even if you want it,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer department where you will find frozen pear leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole pears, fish, beef blood and bunny, pig fat, fish balls, regional sausages, free selling semi-sales and other.
Who buys here: Owners of restaurants and chefs, also own families and individuals.
The broad streets come out to meet shopping cars and high-speed cars.
Find: Fresh moonong durian next to the treasure stand.
Where it is located: Trade is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of the Chinese neighborhood and centers - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be contained, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highway will stay at the old one.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was denied.
On selected sections of the motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed by up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, she decided to join the Senate's amendment proposal, which rejected the increase in speed.
The new land communications law is now heading towards the president.
By the end of April, President Miloš Zeman had said that the law would allow a foot-and-a-half-mile rate to be vetted.
In contrast to the increase, the Minister of Transport Dan Çok (for the UN) has also been the Minister of Transport, according to which the Czech road network has not yet been built at such speed.
On Tuesday before the MP, he supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved novelty will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase of speed from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, in particular four-way.
The House first extended this option even to the roads where it would be possible to drive at selected speeds up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The messengers have now come to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also claimed the right of the transport police to have the last word to edit local communications that the locals are trying to do.
The Senate version approved by the House of Representatives is also intended to allow the sewerage, water or public lighting cables to be stored along the surface of the vehicles.
This would save the city for the redemption of the land.
The village should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
Novela is also intended to help improve road safety and to facilitate the operation of vehicles with trailers to which the owners do not apply.
A new municipality could sell towed vehicles which are not registered within a period of six months following notification of their withdrawal.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport across their territory on roads of second and third classes under the threat of torture and for shipping companies.
It also interrupts the possibility of introducing electronic road signs instead of old paper, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral speaker goes to court.
He's been threatened for 10 years by the prejudiced welcome of the citizens.
The case relates to the allegedly anticipated citizens' welcome project.
The police wanted to report in this case to Ms Zuzan Kailov (ČSSD), but she did not issue her photo.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both men and women are threatened with up to ten years in prison.
The main calculation is planned for two October days.
According to state representative Mandík and Macík, at least one million crowns have been damaged, resulting from the accusation.
The complaint is based on a knowledge assessment.
Former city managers, according to the plaintiff, had unlawfully obtained the property benefits of the company which organised the welcome of the citizens.
Mandík, according to the charge of the then Chief of the Judicial Committee for Urban Services, Education and Culture, filed a complaint to the Chief of the Municipal Services, Education and Culture Board to refer to the five companies involved in the selection procedure.
When another company that offered the lowest price joined the competition, the councillor cancelled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the city administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extras.
Both charges were directed to ensure that Darothore awarded a public procurement order for events Greetings of citizens in Ústí nad Laba for a long time and coordinated at least in breach of the requirement for the proper care of the economy, the State representative writes.
At the same time, he was aware that after receiving this order, Darothore calculated Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcome to the Price Citizens event, which would be increased disproportionately against the real value of the services actually provided.
Over three years later, according to the project record, the company has invested more than five million crowns.
The city finally paid only one piece, about 1.7 million crowns, then retired from the contract.
The amount paid was estimated to be at least one million crowns.
Mandík has already refused any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this built-in case, said a former prime minister before, that under his leadership, the city was just linked to a similar project from years ago.
In 2008-2010, the event was provided by agency Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminals originally wanted to accuse Mrs. Kaill, who was also a member of the city council.
She didn't hand her out to complain.
Criminals have therefore dropped the case in her case, but they count on Kaill's charge after her parliamentary mandate is over.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children's needs and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly left a dog on the runaway.
Then the reporters took a record.
The Hungarian police on the border with Serbia briefly detained the cameraman of the AP agency and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog allegedly hit the country of the refugee.
But the Hungarian government is questioning this charge.
An alleged incident occurred Saturday night when the cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia through the corn fields near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The fugitives were attacked by policemen, and one of them let a certain Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his boot.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he shouted, "Museum says.
The one Muzi's filming everything, he noticed one of the cops, and he wouldn't let him go.
Then the journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark place at the Refugee Registration Center and asked him to show them what he had stored.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
The museum thus lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt at risk because they were near.
The AP agency sent a protest letter to the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
The behaviour of police officers in it was seen as unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not fear that the government would destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovács, with the appeal to Muzi's police report, questioned the counts of events.
He said the cops just wanted a reporter to show them if they're on some photos that they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him.
"Dogs can leap - they are trained to scare away and push a little fear, but certainly not attack," Kovács says.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Victory at City will push us, believe Juventus
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," the head of Manuel Pellegrini, looking at the home city.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the League of Masters.
Not one team has created a lot of opportunities, but we had a ball on the bottom.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," assessed the attack of Pellegrini, whose team was incarcerating in a competition attack after a long 636 minutes.
The finalist of the last Juventus season was exactly the opposite before the encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league he has to defend the title only point and score 2:4 is up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why turning to Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will psychologically help us, it will push us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistances before the new year - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
In Manchester, Pogba, Mandjukic and Morat were represented.
"That's right, this victory is very important, maybe it will help us win the wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half, we were better, mostly in the attack phase.
This result is what my players deserve.
"Before our balancing goal we could have done the opposite at 0:2, but Gianluig supported us," praised Allegri's bull Buffon.
"We've burned a few good odds," hated by Yay Touro, the city's keeper.
We need to get from the League of Experience Masters and try a better result next time.
Good-bye, Angelo. Good-bye, old Germany II.
Before we continue to raise the question of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media rigging around is handled by professionals.
According to media needs and also seshora.
So let's stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and media full of children carrying their parents on the dusty paths of the Exodus.
And it causes a person - that is, a European person - an automatic sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't come here just desperate little children, notice on the pictures of the docking ships to the Greek islands that the baby is not so visible on them!
Well, we've been missing a picture of a ship heading for Lampedus lately, fleeing from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful walks include thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And they also disappeared images from Callais, where these men are eating and black men are waiting to see if they can cross the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess she doesn't get it anymore.
Neither did the pictures of the primitive Christian Eritrean church make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much of a fake running out of it.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it's kind of hidden that it's not only about unhappy children from Syria, but also about exposed - for older people: fashioned - young men.
The muscles that look like they just came out of a fitness center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we stayed on the private beach of the hotel.
No matter how private she was, a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no hams.
And young black people came out of them.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in brand clothes and shoes, in hand, like otherwise, smartphones.
That it is a private beach, it is not interesting and employees - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They've filled all the beds.
Whoever wasn't on it and was just in the sea had a bad heart.
They were dressed like American rappers.
On the head of a hat with a finger, white and color adhesives on your feet.
Then they went to the local beach bar and started to grow.
They sat around the table, sat next to the sitting breakfast and white guests at the bar - a number of Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere in peace.
The next blacks drank beer just like a third - how in the series from the USA?! - they threw empty bottles around the beach.
They kept shouting at each other.
It wasn't English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, even from the bottle.
They entered the hotel pool - in the swimming pools, especially the young ladies - in the water they shouted, mothers with children and pensioners fled in fear and were no longer on the beach or in the pool any more than half an hour.
Everyone's gone.
No matter whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The priest said to me in the evening, "Have you seen the gold they had on them?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had on his neck about 20 centimeters of gold mass cross.
And women were like gold.
"Are these drug-passers?" I asked.
"You've seen them humming," said the waiter.
Drugs don't steal, they don't live.
They're doing something completely different.
So I already knew what they were doing.
However, in June 2105, it wasn't so important to me.
I didn't know what would follow.
But secret services and top politicians were supposed to know that first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were born in Europe at the time.
And they went, and they went, and they went.
Today it has been shown that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-justice policies, such as intellectuals and their associated lobbyist and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its policy - today the leading public power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only they, also the tip of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of Moscow television images from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sundials at the station, but mainly - the ancient Germans - the Muslims welcomed their fellow believers.
For weeks they have been talking about reports on Czech television, as according to some German research, almost all of them for the arrival of immigrants.
But whoever was in Germany only a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Law Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept more refugees a week ago.
That's also what our TVs reported.
However, they kept secret what happened the other day in Germany: that in the poll vote on the article it was shown that 94.5% of Germans no longer want immigrants - the polls were attended by 67,000 people.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago: "Our efforts to 'multi-culture' society has failed completely."
Then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts towards such coexistence have been totally unsuccessful."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it is said that there is no evidence of a strategy that has enabled people from different cultural backgrounds to live by themselves without integration. Today they live with us, and we have been pretending for some time that they will not disappear one day.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, when we say we're just living happily alongside ourselves, has failed this approach.
He was totally wrong.
But neither does Merkel have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and, above all, against political correctness.
It shows the escalation of events.
The conflict is growing fast.
Eurodemec Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD MP, the only one who allegedly has no formal qualifications in the European Parliament - yes, that is what Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play the supervisor in the concentration for a minute - has been performing as a matter of fact.
It seems, especially under the view of the latest German politicians, that Germany has exceeded Rubikon.
Note that, to some extent, most European politicians do not support these forecasts, the statesmen of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are frightened.
What happened to Germany?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who's been trying, at least out there, to deal with their horrific past of the aggressor and the killer of millions?
Are they right to say that there is a devil in the soul of Germany who is filled with aggression, superiority and violence?
Was it true that Chancellor Otto von Bismarck stopped all of his efforts to control the Grand Duchy all over Europe?
When did he say the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When she was released, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of the Grand Duchy, which led Germany and Europe to two wars, which cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different way.
After attempts by Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rota Army Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, Germany, for example, based on ecology, which was, by the way, one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say the sun.
German elites have long defended the emergence of German nationalism, and so left in peace all those fighters against the atom, eager to find paradise for all, quietly supported the old emperor and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people everywhere who want to do something different and better, they are fully committed to the side of combatants against global warming, stop nuclear power stations, etc.
And they forgot that in this stream there is also a very anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slovenian current that all Slovenians consider to be a difficult verb - since the time of Karl Marx, who, according to his parents, was mainly German nationalist.
And also, as the recent calendars of Schulze and the German minorities openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states, the idea of Germany's leader.
Which is necessary without apologizing.
Otherwise you're in trouble!
And if we get into it that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And it is behind it as always capital, especially German, which is suited to it and which is the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The Sunflower Pseudovirus first led Germany to the brigades of ecology and multiculturalism and brought them home today and will bring perhaps millions more Muslims.
Who, the deaf siren voices, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they'll start to budge.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbours with force, and once again, part of its inhabitants - but as it seems to be still smaller - can ideologically spoil it, but finally reality as it always does.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim dwellings are already burning.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the coming Islamists explode?
To whom will Muslims who have been living in Germany for a long time come to help, but certainly not assimilating to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, coming Islamists and Germans leave behind, following the fear of Islamism of their country?
What will he do with Germany, and even with Germany, when people raise their voices and publicly protest against the new euro-maintained Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict that has led to the support of solar ideologies in Europe, i.e. the ideologies of electorate and in principle totalitarian, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unmistakable behaviour towards disobedient democratic Germans and all subordinate and disobedient eastern neighbours, it cannot do well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of intruders is to scare them to death.
It's just a knock-on and a hard-ass knock on you in a way that doesn't just have to get the weaker character up.
The living head will gently set you up and set you up and set you on the road, accompanied (or set up) by an invigorating salesperson and a living glass.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaker didn't even have to deal with it.
We could use a lot of dicks and shit.
Oxalis corniculata.
A small flower that tolerates the dry environment.
And that's how it's located between the outdoor tiles near my apartment.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expansive flowers, but it creates a beautiful impression of the flowering.
It's between the outer tiles.
She's unquestionable, she's doing it in our garden.
He likes a dry environment, it's easy to adapt, it's modest and it's not complicated.
Although they create sheets of chaotic composition, that's why it's worth watching and taking pictures.
The beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves is just under the view as well as with the purple accompanying.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet when breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came in a shocking way to try to provide women with knowledge of the importance of good food by using images of children from the breast-painted image of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide all the animals that are needed to create a strong immune system.
Due to the overhaul of energy requirements, it is recommended that pregnant women and newborn mothers increase their daily calorie income by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should take.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates interest, although Nine's trying to take the lead at Today's Show
The conflict between Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberry due to the cost of the failure of the liberal leadership has not been able to create sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
Nine's early show from national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's release to Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise and host David Koche and Samantha Armytage are part of a long series of international television broadcasts in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of the distance from the Aussie TV shows is so much concerned because it recorded on average 397,000 viewers in five major cities compared to 330,000 viewers today.
Today, she noted a smaller increase in her evaluation compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was until last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in the last few months, he's filling up a gap on Sunrise.
In August, on average, there were 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap moved between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds of change affect more this morning than Parliament alone, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
A great report for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 words with a former star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the eastern part of New Zealand has on average a very powerful 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull a TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's night is a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven left strong 1,136 million spectators, which beat The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed surveillance the second night The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new TV show (from 17:00 to 17:30) that Andrew O'Keefe said had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the decrease in The Chase Australia rating from the second night, Nina will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute series that couldn't beat McGuirov's show.

Three in the finals agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who does he choose?
Secrets discovered?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not have found out who wins the Bachelor.
The woman that Sam Wood comes to Bachelor is a secret that is unsurpassable.
And the three girls who will remain will certainly not reveal who is the right one to finally get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before we were just two, they said thanklessly to us who wins.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut to the Thursday final.
All three women lyricically wondered why Wood was a perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, in the question, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?" their answers could work as a spojler about who gets the heart of Bachelor.
Like Jeavons-Fellows, the Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one who would be best suited to Wood except for them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing an easy relationship since one day.
"From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think it during the course," Jeavons-Fellows says.
"Sarah is really a grounded woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
It's good and nice together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could be the first couple.
She claims for herself that during his last visit home, she realized that Wood might be "the right one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," he adds.
I was wondering who Wood would have chosen if she hadn't, she was looking mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Snow White and Lana for sure.
Bachlor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned after his great start of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit down after the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugby league at the first out of the top at Tuesday's 20:3 victory in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after he hurt Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also honest in the dress after the game.
Instead of squeezing the newbies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and just take care of another game.
Already during the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne made his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the beginning of Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught giving up when he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio ghost Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 worse career start in the NFL he didn't even have to imagine.
"That happens, you just focus on another game and that's all," Hayne said
Hayne compared the traps to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own field led to the three Queensland.
It was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans holding an Australian flag on her own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will meet in the debate on homosexual rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested by targeted guns on the Siberian plain.
After he openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts limited.
The U.S. has become emigrants who have been demanding property refunds.
Two of them emigrated in 1984, and their real estate was acquired by a new owner.
Since 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the two turned to the state for damages under the law on extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The Court first entrusted them with the amount required, i.e. more than 2.8 million crowns, but the appeal court amended their claim in such a way that it granted them only a total of 90 thousand crowns with the reference to the fixing of the amount of the refund in accordance with the 1991 price rules.
The Emigrants have become the Supreme Court and have received the amount they originally claimed.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, but turned to the U.S. appeal.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then applicable legislation - although it was then adequate in respect of the property in question - today only reaches a fractional amount of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the burden of supporting participants who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide a refund before," explained the judge to the rapporteur, Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ÚS has been on the side of immigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly expressed itself that the general courts should proceed in return in such a way that the possible inconsistencies are not explained in the failures of the eligible persons and that the purpose of the return legislation is always achieved, that is to say, the effect of the material injury caused by the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evitu in musical Studio DVA is now the creative Council of Fishermen.
By the way, the Council of Fishers became the world's youngest Evit, when in 1998 she created the role of wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musician Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague Spiral Theatre.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's demands have not balanced the performance."
It's not just an amazing role to be avoided, it's also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monica Absolon as the first lady in Argentina.
I saw Monca in Evita three times, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
I saw a whole new concept here all of a sudden.
I'm quite a favor of more modern adjustments, but this is just specifically stated.
"Ondřje Sokola's direction is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fischer.
The thoughtful transmission of the musical knife between the two singers will take place at the birthday concert Monica Absolon on September 27th from 19 hours in Studio DVA.
They're playing the music of Evita tonight.
The experiences will certainly include a joint Don't Cry For Me Argentina duet.
In a limited number of performances from the director's desk, Ondřej Sokol will also jump off when he plays during Karl Roden's film as President of Perón.
For the public interest, further deadlines were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musician Evita introduces the Studio DVA theatre in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London successfully since February 2015.
In the direction of Ondřeje Sokola, Monika Absolon initially studied the main female role.
On her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
The legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with the Czech texts of Michael Prostejowski sound in the production of a live orchestra led by Kristof Mark, who has already participated in the first performance in the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police shot rubber missiles at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber missiles into the hands of demonstrators against the new state constitution, the officer said on Wednesday.
There was violence Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the temporary officer, states that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used the tear gas and then shot into the air before they turned to the rubber projectors.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, known for their ability to kill, were traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This meeting was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi said they had created a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which requires the emergence of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
when the four major political parties signed the agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have speeded up the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week's lawmakers in Kathmandu voted on the draft constitution and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After the defeat on the ice of master Lithuania you did not even have a domestic duel with hockey player Sparta (3:5).
Don't you have any fear of a similar catastrophic entry into the extraliga as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
Four people.
NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide, low - pressure system of some 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to produce a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, says the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, probably between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent probability of developing tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added a weather forecast with a residence in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to select $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it would launch a campaign aimed at selecting $11 million for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded European countries in the war of the countries that are displaced and poor.
Google announced this on his blog in a very unusual way.
She published a report on her blog to an employee named Google Rita Masoud on the basis of her personal experience when she ran away from Kabul for seven years.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with the growing immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families, like her, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed between 4 non-profit organisations assisting refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that all contributions made via google.com/refugeerelief to $5.5 million will double.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria, confused by the four-year war, which has only spared 4 million people this year.
Many people are fleeing from the war of failed Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetes may be a useful surgery of loss
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too soon to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after surgery for loss than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The data on mortality lasts for a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on the surgery of loss, who wrote the leader of the new JAMA surgery study.
Surgery for loss, bariatric surgery is used to reduce the stomach of different methods.
The reduction of hunger and the restriction of the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted in people with morbidity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or more.
BMI, which measures the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal in values between 18,5 and 24,9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicate the overweight of the person and people with over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from the study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and gastretomy - in type 3 diabetes treatment procedures in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately the same as those who did not receive surgery for diabetes.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36% and in part in 28 cases.
In the treatment group, only 1 per cent and only about 2 per cent of patients were completely resolved for the comparison of diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Researchers were also monitoring patients with a haemoglobin of A1c in the blood, reflecting a transient level of blood sugar in the body.
Haemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7%, researchers say.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin of A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, this value remained at around 8 percent in the group treated.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality within five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastro-intestinal group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved higher BMI decreases (7.4 to 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent) and had a higher probability of diabetic remission (46.9 per cent to 16.7 per cent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life extension, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had a 29 per cent greater chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that had tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, Blackstone says it is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is precisely where this work is critical, because it states that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it says.
Blackstone further argues that people and their doctors should start taking the weight really seriously after the reduction of patient BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long for people to know the seriousness of the situation," he says.
I think that once the collection of these genetic changes that are firmly linked to their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the road back is really difficult.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to understand all refugees, says Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of the Buddhists called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees.
Dalailam addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which deals with the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, mankind’s interest should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, no matter how surprising, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to solve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Trying for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We have to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also voiced complaints against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the violent reaction of the United States has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences to President Bush's letter and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences," Dalailam said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have experienced a sanitary agent in the last 4 years
The U.S. toxicology centre reported an almost 400-percent increase from 2010 in the number of children to 12 years of age who had a high alcoholic sanitation plant, according to the U.S. toxicology centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the number of use of sanitation in children up to 12 years of age reported at the poison control centre increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children receive these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
Some children drink a cure deliberately, while others want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge to social media.
Youtube videos show the yearnings to drink sanitation because of the cheap habit.
Over the next few years, they reportedly mixed oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to an attractive scent.
"Children don't think about it could hurt them," Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitation products with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or orange are available, which are very soft for children.
The remedy contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, several laps can be a poison of alcohol.
"It's a high-concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just let a glass of whiskey roll like that, but people leave these sanitation out, and when kids get to it, it's a fast way to consume alcohol.
Nhaija Russel, a six - year - old girl who recently saw up to four locks of a sanitary agent with the smell of strawberry and was taken away for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double-fold dust value considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chrise Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaija spoke inexplicable words and was unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency.
Her doctors were monitoring her overnight in a single baby hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen for alcohol and had a headache, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to arrange for childcare.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some remedies have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the ingestion of a cure containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, more than ethanol, which was mentioned as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth year in North New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher with the placement of antibacterial products by room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.
The police judged the intended plan as "innocent oppression," and referred to the discipline of the school district,
Fam: No disagreement in the Celtic team
Griffiths is bagating up the rumors of insanity in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops is in the wrong place, but he's going back.
Hearts will fight SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is afraid that the new ice force will disrupt the team's unit.
Dons raise their head above Celtic by 5 points
The first half of Adama Rooney's pendulum provided Aberdeen with a close victory over Hamilton in Pittofria, which resulted in Dons having a five-point jump between him and Celtic.
Griffiths rejects speeches about insanity
This situation led to riots in Celtic, which were supported by Griffiths, which insists that he and his partners do not work under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the fight with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Dutch representative Ronald de Boer claim that Dutch fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they no longer have any rivalry for title.
De Boer, who is now Ambassador Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?"
Because there's no Rangers there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're just interested in that.
In the games of the Old Company there is great tension and not only people from Scotland are following these games.
I'm turning things around for good. Deal's engaged.
ROONY DALIA admitted that Celtic was a bit beaten up, but the Norwegian chief committed himself to turning things around for good.
The defeat of Malmem and the subsequent defeat of the League of Masters was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and is now referring to the top of the table with a five-point jump.
But Deila says, "Celtic's been through a bad time and he's gonna get up again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad with the current.
We're totally the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic's support because it makes players much better.
Now it's very important to stay with you.
Warburton's worried about the ice cream.
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his ice goals, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the large purchase of power and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team.
Former chief Brentford says, "The ice transition window is very different from the summer window."
Players coming in in summer have a whole pre-season period to settle, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really good.
Sometimes there will be more damage by adding the necessary players to those you really need.
The transition objective of Celtica Micha indicates retirement
The attacker Swansea Micha, who was associated with Celtica in the criminal window, indicated that after his contract with Swansea could retire.
The 20-year-old shooter has been having trouble with the tilting angler for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Nelson
Hearts led 2-1 when Patterson was sent to the dress and finally lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was canceled later - one of the third red cards issued by decision-makers Collum, who was withdrawn.
Neilson stands behind his claim and says, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths committed himself to avoiding Tynacastle
The stubborn Hibbe was severely punished after he admitted that he sang a song with a text aimed at former Hearts Rudolf Skácel.
The incident occurred in the Roserburn holding in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynacastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a terrible moment," the attacker said and continued, "I can say for sure that I won't go back to Tynacastle unless it's in Celtic."
The Council of Denmark believes in the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Council of Dundee United still believes in repairing the situation with the current team's management - but admits that the fall in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boy ready for action again," says Donnelly.
MCInnes likes to be "a vicious victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight Hamilton Action desperately to win their seventh league victory after themselves and a five-point jump before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to the first half of Adam Rooney's sentence.
McInnes says, "There's no team that won anything, no more cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game."
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK's overall unemployment is rising
Incompatibility in Scotland remains unchanged for 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen from 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The measure of Scottish unemployment was 5.9 per cent higher than that in the UK (5.5 per cent), as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a period of three months, and the number of workers now stopped at 2 612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year that Scotland has made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has grown, while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the repair in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man die.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who'll fix the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who will witness his death.
I first received an invitation in January through my best friend and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole death penalty story.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists should be allowed to monitor repairs in America and because there are often more requests than free places, a morbid lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of jobs for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll be watching the whole repair.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit on the side of Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've made a special connection to him through a month of phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like that boy.
We laugh a lot when we talk together.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a note block and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
This is a lesson.
Tell him the story of the executioner, how it's gonna turn out, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could have formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be on my side.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of a felony.
But I believe there is a great likelihood that he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the correction is bad.
And from this point of view, I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm being really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you'll get from me is the experience of seeing a man I love die a waste of death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police hunt
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry after he fired men from Canning River.
The stake of a man from Petrha who was fleeing to the police didn't come out after he got into a little muddy water just a few meters from a policeman who tried to force him to return to the shore.
The Canning Vale police were called in for an incident that went beyond Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to escape them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated "I'm not going out, just come for me," said Sergeant Tradel Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wash his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactic and a police deal."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they're running," Castledine said.
The Ben Cousins football champion provides a memorable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove to the airport to avoid the bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threatened to finish the race
Peeter Moody accused the director of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He focused on the sponsors and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the conviction that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scrapping on the day of the race, which was his last stop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race and felt in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive blow to the cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He slipped into his tongue about the charge of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry horrors."
"I didn't want to say anything about having been on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it'll all come out of you all of a sudden," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and get some sleep.
I want to go with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking the other way around, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
Earlier Moody released in his interview for the racing.com bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after a question - and offered him employment in my booths to find out about the things that are happening in my booths," Moody said at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a cheat.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information because in an attempt to catch me they burned me completely.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Soundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of it at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think it's a personal matter?
Does RVL grow a few balls and arrange for people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe I need to take my license and get rid of me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will provide them with material to think about.
But I got to the point when I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really upset me.
I'm going to press them, and I'm going to take care of them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The levels of frustration of the coach have increased with a long-term investigation into cobalt, including Leaders, and recent abuse in it has aroused the feeling that "may be an hour's license on the table."
Mood, the most famous for the preparation of the unbeatable Black Caviar champion, marked the treatment rule on the day of the race as "laughing" after the horse was applied to the legs of a wooden bead or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone from my team failed to wear his foot mud.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and so did it.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the siege on the day of the race to which the authors had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobra driver who caught was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a cyclist on the weekend in Cobra and left after the wheel.
The cyclist was transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
The police indicated that the driver left without stopping and helped the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia admitted himself to the Shepparton police.
He is expected to be accused of indiscriminate accidents, non-assistance and other transport offences.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in a hospital in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy is returning a hit to the rivals for wrestling
Craig Bellamy, coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the actions of his players as "setting a plan" to two NRL favorites of the premiere.
Trent Robinson, Coach Sydney Roosters, said that the decision-makers allowed Storm players to "tell" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennett, coach Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly green note on the Storm after his team won the final qualification over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game a "survival" of the League's rugby and according to him two from Queensland were not "too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that this situation had increased his awareness because his team was criticized by two leading coaches, which may mean they were afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were defeated 24-2," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that in the last year we have not changed anything from our defence system and technology, in the last few weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during the operations, and that meant a turning point for us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how such things always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy disillusioned Bennet's idea of "arousing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team St George-Illawarr Dragons won the 2010 premiere by playing "weary" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a game style that seems to him to be overwhelming, especially his young depositors at their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two books like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me feel more self-conscious because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they got into big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that in the Storm and Roosters match, more branches fell than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos team game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting to pause and not score?
I think it's an agenda.
If they mention us, it means we'll meet again in a certain stage.
Storm have this weekend's break and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks at the preliminary final next Saturday evening in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold from the morning of the next Tuesday.
Serbian man won bail 200,000 USD for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life of holding 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland won a $20,000 bail.
Marko Maximovic (29 years old) was one of five men who last month arrested a federal police patrolling 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Coomer in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting with the defendants at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Even though he faced a potential judgement of life for the possession of commercial quality cocaine, the lawyer Maximovice argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop entirely by chance and innocent.
Judge of the Supreme Court Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would escape.
It has a clear link to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said on Wednesday.
In the Crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
His mother and his own father, Maximovice, jointly offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the two persons' sworn statements, it is obvious that the deposit of the bail of USD 200 000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their own efforts were obviously insufficient because the accused did not get further to the court, he warned.
Maximovic has been granted bail on condition that he surrenders both Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police every day and will comply with the ban of departure from 18 o'clock in the morning to 6 a.m.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone with eleven-year-old girls to get photos of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then applied for her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate photos of the kids who sent him another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing the phone and then found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She passed it, and before she warned her mother, she found disturbing reports.
The police involved and saw five photos, then the analysts found the address and discovered "anxious" search on the web using expressions to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that his reason was to "put the pedophiles on the Internet" before "pretend he's a police officer and scare them."
fiscal representative Eilid Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - that it's dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but he claims he just wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another.
According to him, he was doing it to get them.
He claims to have jumped in his drink and said he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found news on her phone, she called her mother, cried and cried.
She saw immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was heard and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a dwelling in Ward Road, Dundee, admitted the guilt of bringing an action for the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and did not reach a hearing at the court on 24 March this year.
The defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual delinquents, because he could argue that in his act there was "no basic sexual subtext."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael filed a verdict in October for the submission of a social worker report.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sexual delinquency list before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, had fallen on the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but his video fell viral in the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also confirmed by opposition legislators' claims that they had received anonymous threats to the killings they had been warned against during Mr Mugabe's speech.
Last month he was drafted and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - which is the word he repeated on Tuesday.
The president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians had adopted text messages on their mobile phones with warning not to defend Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is called 'death'," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and that once it leaves Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has concerns about threats to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is going to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard abolishes 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save business costs.
HP will later be divided into two companies listed on the stock exchange and will separate the business with computers and printers from its faster growing company hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change in the amount of $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, the company HP states.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenditure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and the president of the agency, who will be in charge of the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than today's HP and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will receive more than $50 billion annually after the company's declaration and "will focus on providing non-competitive integrated technology solutions" to the company.
This will result in the deployment of a company founded in 1930 by the Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who manufacture electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was renamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP was undergoing a massive reorganisation to manage the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that a closely specialised company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that the co-players must get to the injured Jack Wilsher in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilsher that it's still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there's no reason to stop playing Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly lose at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in another summer European championship is clearly not true.
The biggest damage to this latest problem is that Wilsher ended last season strong after the angle wound and then went back to the former shape during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not endanger your career," Wenger says.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's not about anything special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be from a purely medical point of view of the truth, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
The research conducted by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. has recorded 23 different injuries to Wilsher since he had his play debut six years ago.
During the last five years, only 65 football matches in Arsenal from a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the magic circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
"When you return after the injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win a competition," Wenger claims.
Jack's young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal launches a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will probably be on their way.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and let players who need it breathe out," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite in the F group, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of being the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dynamo was also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after they held the "invincible" campaign last season.
In the middle of the night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees.
That was in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions, when he capitulated against Monaco and remained distant from him, hoping to lead the club to the first victory in the European Cup.
"This settlement is huge," Wenger says.
Arsenal never happened.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar displays in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, with regard to suicide among young men up to 15 years of age.
In 2013, it was the only cause of death in men 20-45 years of age in the United Kingdom and remained three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of Men, whose aim is to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help if necessary.
There is a friendship in the heart of this fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that in case the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends represents a half chance of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be possible first.
In this communication through social media with emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, we have doubled our need to look stronger, more loving and more successful, even though we are actually more isolated.
This superficial success is governed by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything on the basis of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and gamemaker explained recently, money really doesn't buy any more luck.
The beauty of the Friends series was for him the source of this idea.
None of the characters have been defined by their work, but by their personalities, which were sparked by friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victim, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's desire for Rachel, all the springs of knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though most of them keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies has truly confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with their friends.
The old order "to deal with it" is strong in that it will be considered weak to open up problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term balance mechanism.
He highlights little moments in a male friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, network of friends and family.
So if this weekend you are going to the FriendsFest scheduled at Comedy Central station, why not take your friends to a glass shop in Central Perk, where the interior for the occasion of the celebration will be completely reworked.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Series Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central from start to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG mix Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after shooting a branch against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in the League of Masters and thus helped PSG to defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in the League of Masters with a final comfort victory 2-0 against Malmo at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the branch less than four minutes after her debut in the League of Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions for victory, but then they threw a few chances until they finally raised their head when Cavani shot the branch in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they are not only focused on qualification in the racing circles, but on improving their trip to the quarter final, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they won three points, it was not the classic performance of the Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic team that was empty-handed before the branch and was later set up against his home team and club, in which he started his well-known career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win out or at home in the League of Masters, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortable in the defense is a good start, although there are things we will have to improve with the season procedure," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot more than one or two.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which kept this weekend 2-2 with Bordeaux in Liza 1, but was shaded by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved the PSG in Europe to a new level after a transition from Manchester United that took place last month, and showed why when he ran to the passport of Marc Verratti for the defense of Malma and with a beautiful finish he sent a ball behind Johan Wilanda to the remote corner of the branch.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off and got into this stage, appeared with 9 internationals in the base and five defenders and two hidden hostages were a heavy opponent.
But in addition to the shooting of Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trappa in 34 minutes, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG itself sought the benefit of the attack by bad play and the miserable ending, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who was unable to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot reached the net shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, it turned out much more appropriate when it came to preparing a chance for his teammates, and it was just from his play when Di Maria sent a shot that ended up in the Willand dam after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayan headman sent the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic played him after the play from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could get something out of the game, and only the excellent action by Wilanda from a very close up lost the hopes of David Luise and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the running Ezequiel Lavezzi was unknown at the end of the game.
Coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the League of Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played a Swedish league that's not on the same level.
Qualifications are not available.
Downstairs for Paris.
It was a catch-up game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion for sale.
Glencore, a retired giant living in Switzerland, was hit by the collapse of commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion on average from the sale of shares under his extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore states in his statement that she sold a new share worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is faced with a commodity price reduction, as Chinese economic slowdown reduces demand and exacerbates clear market distortions.
The rights issue sent Glencore to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on the middle of the price.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore discovered last week that sale of shares worth $2.5 billion is part of broader plans to reduce their debt to $30 billion, which has accumulated about a third.
The company sold a new share in the price of 123 pensions per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
Thus, 1.3 billion shares were released at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
Concerns about the extension of Chinese growth have reduced the iron ore price by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities dropped by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington was visiting Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit of President Xi to Washington will take place on 25 September in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president welcomed him in November, the report stated.
American President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his even Peng Liyuan to a state dinner that will take place after the talks are over.
"The visit of President Xi provides an opportunity to strengthen relations between the US and China and encourages cooperation in addressing problems in the fields of international, regional and common interest and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements of both states," the report reports.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York at the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to solve controversial problems, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyberspionage and its increasing aggressiveness in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shook the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not nearly drowned the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union has decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem: it will instead systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than fighting for future refugee distribution on the basis of quotas, which are increasingly faring away.
Six days after the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redeploy 160,000 refugees, ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to first filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary to manage migration," the text of the ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is in danger in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flood of those seeking asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that there is no free movement in Europe without it.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France also consider this, even though with different intensity.
Hungary's been moving on with this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but it's also blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already moved to their own country.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary during a private discussion.
This idea is not at all new, but there's a crowd coming.
In Italy, two thirds of newly arrived runners have already been registered and identified with fingerprints.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point in its territory, because it is more afraid that there will be no camps on its shoulders where refugees will gather on its account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200 thousand people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which has twice as many as recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after the overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge healing hole.
Athens, who are still in financial turmoil and waiting for a new government, have laid their hands on their knees.
This is the starting point for the Balkan road and the source of now joint concerns for German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Juncker's commission promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not entered any number or date.
"The challenges Greece is facing relate to Europe as a whole," EU ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore a matter of setting up a European Borders Agency intervention team in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum-seekers and strengthen island surveillance.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is coming closer.
The new emergency situation of the eighty-eighth as well as the second issue of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which had been raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament in early years, and which had been strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their superiority.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in the text approved by most of the eighty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise includes the redeployment of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU Hectic Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the avalanche in the Alps, of which three are the Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed the avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who survived as the only one of the affected single group.
The previous media reports said it was Polka.
About 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury.
The dead formed mostly four-quarters according to the AFP.
"The rescue action ended, and the bodies of the victims were also transferred to Briancon for identification," Hautes-Alpes Prefect Pierre Besnard explained.
Unfortunately, around noon it happened in the mountain area of Pelvoux under the top of the mountain Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, the chief of rescuers.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow had been added to a group of eight hundred feet [3900 m].
Meteorological service today did not warn in the area of unfavourable weather.
Tolerance before the Brago match: Finally, the real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, at his opening in the cup, was able to pass through the European League's foreword to the base group with the Liberce football team, and now he is glad that he is using the right Europe with the team.
Sloven to the introduction of the main phase of the competition welcomes the finalist from 2011 Bragu and according to the bitch wants to impress her game style.
After all the nerves in the racing fights, when every goal and every situation could turn you on your way to a dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every hacked branch, we can play our tactics and we're not just bound by a double-cross.
"I am very pleased with this and it is a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
Bragu thinks he's a top team.
It will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the balls.
The opponent might be even more difficult than that he doesn't have such a name, but in his chair he has a player who gives Manchester three goals.
"It's an excellent total at the top level of teams," Trpišovský noted.
But Brag doesn't consider it a clear preference.
I take it we're playing at home, so the outsideers are definitely not.
"I think we've shown both in the domestic competition and in the suburbs that we're strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said a team who lost 11 duels this season just the introductory Superpoch in Plzi.
They believe that Liberec can also force Braze's style.
We're waiting for a team that'll be strong on the ball, but it's not usually disciplined for them.
They play from 4-4-2 to a fast transition to the attack phase.
"It is a very difficult opponent, but we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovský.
In the suburbs, we studied a lot of opponents, which helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to.
"And we definitely want it, even though it will be very difficult to play according to our notes," he added.
Student films dominate the Sand, begins an international festival.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries joined the 15th year of the International Festival of Student Films in Písk this year.
Four tenths of them, which were sent to the final by the commission of students and educators, will be nominated in Portyč’s cinema from 15 to 18 October.
The best of them is the international jury, the speaker said to the Jakob Charvat festival.
Each year, the festival has its special theme, which takes place from festival noise.
This year she's a detective.
The director of this year's celebrations Richard Blumenfeld plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre.
"And of course we also have to resolve the crime that was committed in our travel this year," Charvat said.
Visitors will see the choice of the most interesting of the student creation - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, to which, for example, the winner last year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Festival organizers prepare a follow-up program as each year.
Wattian Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřij Ruml, professional player at didgeridoo Ondřij Smeykal, turbošanson group We are flying?, play band Zrní or e.g. Petra Hapková with recital Life at the bar.
The festival will host two photo exhibitions.
The first to bring the graduate of the sand film school and the holder of prestigious awards, including that from the World Press Photo 2014, Jan Aschenbrenner.
The second exhibition is nearing the atmosphere that dominated Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will be accompanied by his music by Gerhard Gruber and his parents Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the workshop of John Novotno's Sochure by his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříčka, the patron FAMO in Písk, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his link to live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film professions," the speaker said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, graduate several job competitions at once and get a job like this.
The festival is linked to the creation of the Private Higher Professional School of Films in Písk.
Her founders, Vladana's husband and Miloň Terč, organized the first anniversary in 1997.
By the sixth year, he was done once in two years.
In the event of a CK failure, the insurance companies must comply with the customer's claims in full.
Insurance companies should comply with customer requirements in the event of a full-scale decrease in the travel office.
She decided this on Wednesday when she approved an amended version of the travel business regulations.
Travel offices will be able, according to the proposal to be considered by the Senate, to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee.
The insurance companies with the obligation to comply with client claims and above the limit of the sitting do not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development maintains and argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance for travel offices against bankruptcy when the new one is paid.
But the proposal also criticises travel offices.
Without insurance, they're either gonna have to end up or go abroad.
Local Development Ministers Karl Schlecht (for the UN) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full refunds are not Eurocomform.
She pointed out this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client had a claim for full repayment regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information on the management of travel offices and will be able to set the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but must have such a limit to be feasible," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
The bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to finish or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The Chairman of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) did not agree with Kalousk's concerns on the basis of a survey among the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us the lobbying insurance," he said.
The statement of insurance does not consider Ocamura to be relevant, nor does it consider that any of its official written statements do not exist in that sense.
They'll find out if the travel offices are going to join, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Prior to the provision, she also warned Jan Fischer (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the Competition Association of Travel Offices of the Czech Republic, and her side colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke of painting stairs to Czech Travel Offices.
Travel offices according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to release the controversial passport was not approved by the camera.
Nor did Vojtich Filip (KSČM) intend to return the proposal to the committee for alleged opposition to the civil law.
Philip pointed out to travel agencies that he believed could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur, Mr Berdich (ANO), in view of the Constitutional Court's verdict, drew up her proposal which would limit the liability of insured persons in cases where they could not know that the insurance requirement would not cover the whole risk.
The novelty will not initially propose a minimum four million insurance limit for travel offices offering air transport missions and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus missions.
The threshold will remain at 30 per cent of planned markets from the sale of tickets.
However, the limit of insurance will have to be such that, in the event of a failure, the travel office will cover all customer claims.
The standard, even after adjustments, provides that travel agencies will have to re-instate the travel agency which organises the journeys at the premises sold.
Travel offices will have to submit insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, data on the economy and number of flights.
The approved amending proposal of the Public Administration Committee shall also be taken into account with further regular information.
Travel offices will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and the number of vehicles sold, the total price of vehicles sold, and the amount of stocks and markets for and indications of vehicles.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel office has failed to fulfil any of the legal obligations to the insurance, it shall call on it, according to the proposal for correction, or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts in case the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of the customers.
Novela is also intended to re-adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of funding for the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The request will contain a report on the use of state money last year, a financial statement of expenditure and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the draft law did not consider what would happen if the insurance company would declare the CK contract.
This will not prevent the takeover and the customers who bought the takeover before the insurance statement will find out according to the association.
In such a case, the CK suffers significant loss and may even be impaired, although its economy was in good condition.
One of the ways in which such a situation can be resolved by the travel agents will be the claim for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use a lot of softer conditions abroad and then on our market we will act only as agencies, said Vice-President of Jan Papež.
However, the proposal for a new one, according to it, also includes a bank guarantee institution, but so unthinking that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound an unlimited amount.
Furthermore, according to the association, the change in the practice of the past is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, it will be necessary to recast the whole law in the light of the new EU directive.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel offices.
This year, only three CKs have completed their activities.
Foreign travel offices sell annual tours worth about CZK 20 billion.
Merkelová: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must establish a framework for improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of fugitives to Europe.
It was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the German Prime Minister.
At the same time, it reiterated its appeal for the division of refugees who have already arrived in the EU between the Member States of the 1980s.
We need more help with the country where refugees leave, where they stay after they leave.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we are based on decent conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal could also be a higher financial aid or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The congregated countries also support the German government in prosecuting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis on European countries," Merkel added.
Land Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this context at the press conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas for a long time rejects, inter alia, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also expressed themselves to speed up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start with the integration of foreigners more quickly, the military prime minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on running is used to integrate those who have a chance to get asylum.
There will be a need for more teachers to get refugees to handle the German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners can integrate, they can benefit us, he said.
Matt Damon's bazaaring diversity in the movie
Matt Damon confronted Afro-Amatic filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the Sunday episode of the Greenlight project HBO interrupted the actor in the Brown series, stressing the need for alternative views regarding black protagonists in the script.
"When we're talking about diversity, you're doing it by filming, not on show," says Damon.
Surprised, she reacted worsen Brown with mistrust and excited "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martjan were received.
Damon and Brown joined a well-known producer named Ben Affleck and brothers Farrelly to discuss the finals of the show.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think whether the director is anyone else, how they're going to behave to the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black character that's a hooker that's wrapped in a white belt.
The producer of the Dear White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to direct the film; Damon said that their director could "at last give us something we don't want."
After the discussion started, the social media exploded in harmony with Damon's comment.
Twitter user Mr.Pooni said, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that the diversity is so BEAUTIFUL that it hurts."
Tweet got more than 5,000 retweet and 4,000 people since it was published.
Damon's comment comes at a time when precise racial representation in the media is ahead of social discussion.
After the death of a teenager, Michael Brown, a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took national action and pressured the creation of laws and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against the colored people.
In February, the songwriter Prince made a move, while stating the nominations in the album category of the year during the Gramma price transfer.
"Alba is still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, either is still important.
The latest leading Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in answer to the Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as an hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," said the leader.
Damon was recently announced on the list of traders, producers and media of Moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the display of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or met with the pope is not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
A professional watchmaker and pictologist Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home a million dollars.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all obstacles to the track.
During the final season this year, two men fought to the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was 30 seconds of spitting more than 220 meters long ago.
Britten graduated as the first and in the prescribed limit and became so the first contestant that in American Ninja Warrior won the four-parts, however Caldiero won it in full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero provided an interview for the newsE! News immediately after his hard-harvested victory and it was known that he is still in shock from winning a major prize worth $1 million.
"It's a wonderful feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," said Isaac E! in response to my victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the final run and why Britten is not getting any reward despite the fact that he became the first competitor to complete the track.
According to the rules, money belongs to those who finish the track as quickly as possible.
"If more competitors are lost, the best time won," Weed said.
Even though winning a major victory would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he'd have any resentment.
He's glad he managed to achieve what he could.
He got a hot reception from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
It's a hero for your children and your wife."
Geoff said to me, "If there was someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will start filming in spring 2016.
The tigers from Detroit just passed by Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- For Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk of the rose garden.
Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are now in the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
They just turned the Tigers back on their defeat when they defeated Minnesota in the Tuesday match with a close result of 5-4 at Target Field.
The twins missed the chance of approaching the Houston Astros team and taking the second wild card in the American League.
Even though for just one night, for Detroit, it was a return of words to Z, which was so inconceivable for them during the second half of the season.
"To win is always fun and doesn't matter how," said the Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Alfredo Simon's tiger dealer held his offensive appearance and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another one in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed enemy 6 1/3 of fire and 3 rounds.
It was his third game from the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to use in the game when you often sit on the bench and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger Warrior Victor Martinez hit three times and made two rounds and his first landing point from mid-August.
For Martinez it was the first three-point match since the last June game in which he hit four times in the Battle of Seattle Mariners.
"He's been doing a great job," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at the training, fired much better and managed to move it to the fight."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins got the greatest chance to return to the game.
Byron Buxton's middle pole was replaced by two points on the left-hand side of the field.
The real polarist Aaron Hicks got a point with his thumb set and Simon shot Brian Dozier before his left hand replaced Blaine Hardy.
Hardy took out his only opponent, Mauer, and before him he had Miguel Sana, who set the ball on fire and circled for two years and left Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on targets and a chance to remise in the second shift, VerHagen managed to send the third meter over two years.
Plouffe's already got 27 rounds over two years in this season and is reigning league tables.
Detroit held the ninth shift, Mauer got two down points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for Tigers.
However, this right-hand man turned Sana out on three occasions.
Detroit took advantage and won points at the Phil Hughes game.
The tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against the slave rightman who entered the game after more than a month's break due to the inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine such a start,” Hughes said, “but during the third shift, I already felt that I was going to be able to move better.”
After resisting the first shift, Hughes left one point at the second meter to Ian Kinsler.
Two marches for the right polar J.D. Martinez took Victor Martinez, who first circled all the targets.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 series.
The third meter Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another round, but Victor Martinez was crossed when he tried to reach the third target.
The tigers added in the second shift when the James McCann transducer and the Anthony Gose polarist won two and we drew one point and on the result table lighted the score 3-0.
"It's got us in our knees," said the manager of the Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of hits, ended up in the third shift without points and replaced him with the right A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three years, got six fires and four strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, a real tiger climber, the match ended with pain in the right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of injured muscles in the shoulder since mid-August, should be in the middle match.
Sanchez will replace the left Daniel Norris, who will come back after the injury and rise against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced as David Price's left rider, he scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
From August 20, however, he hasn't played because of his muscle.
Tigers and Twins play the third interplay at the Target Field stadium on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is set up by the Minnesota Left Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group whose task is Tuesday's reform of the management.
"China should engage in the mitigation of foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," said about the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group to deepen overall reform.
The promotion of opening up to parents' reforms will add new impetus and vitality, will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi says.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory approaches to the market, the liberalisation of border controls policy, the support of state enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration of the resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises outside the investment limits.
This system will gradually be tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This step is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, states the statement.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and ensure that companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The declaration also states that China will be able to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the State-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed from abroad and provide them with better services," the statement states.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of the requirements and the simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practise and develop a professional judge and state representative was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and lead representatives Li Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as announced after the meeting.
There may be a new bed room in the region of Karlovar.
According to the Heitman of the state of Jakub Panika (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed compartments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the country should be sufficient and partial adjustment should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of each hospital.
But there are also possibilities for expanding care in the country.
For example, a one-day surgery centre could be set up in the surgical department, where, according to the concept, the performance of surgical areas that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours could be performed.
In which specific hospitals should focus on one-day surgery, it is not clear yet.
In the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be created again with the possibility of using laser technology to treat the skin disease.
The concept also recommended the emergence of an apalic centre that would care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility into an island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovar region, is the subsequent care bed, in particular the Long-term Treatment of Patients (LDN), whose capacity in the Necka is insufficient and should in particular be closely linked to the emergency care bed.
The part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends the concept.
As he points out, the next care bed is missing mainly in Karlovy Vary's hospital.
There they could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Recently, in the region of Karlovar, there is a lack of a socially healthy bed focusing on Alzheimer’s disease.
This bed is missing throughout the Republic, so it could also serve for other countries as the Alzheimer's Centre.
Hospitals should, as recommended, also be prepared for the introduction of so-called emergency beds to which European funding will be released.
"This is a bed that will be used in the fields of specialised care and will create room for translation of patients after surgery, for example after cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplant or other surgery," the regional concept of bed care describes.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
