White foot on f3, black foot on e6, white foot on g4, black ferret on h4 - matt! In chess circles it is called a “dure matt”.
White: a 1, a foot on b6, a king on c8. Black: a foot on a7 and b7, a king on a8, an elephant on b8. White put the opponent in a tugswang position, with a row on a6, followed by only two options: take a row on a6 or move an elephant on any other field of diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, white move the foot from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In the second case, the white boat takes a black foot on a7 with the same result.
