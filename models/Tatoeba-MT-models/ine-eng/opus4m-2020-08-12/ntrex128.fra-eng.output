Members of the Assembly of the Country of Wales concerned about "passing for puppets"
Gallois elections are blocked by a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Galois Parliament.
In the political sphere, Members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rails.
An elected employee indicated that his group was concerned that the stamp "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For non-original readers in Wales: in gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Gallois, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, said that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is back to the latter."
The 2007 Law on the Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Galois Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as the Galois Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is thinking in favour of Members of the Galois Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real head start for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name during discussions on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now bear the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a long-standing age between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, indicated that he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that changing the name is only a small price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, Saint Martin bells reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church at every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more than today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to be refurbished.
Today, "we don't go the same way anymore, he explains.
"We used to go to the bar like his neighbor, but that's no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted well before the authorities imagine and worry it: "before or after, they will return to the home."
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be mostly white people who will rush the closing of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left the scene in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which preached in the area, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken back by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were reluctant to use or obtain promotion.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the Church of Saint Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the bells of the poor.
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of question about the removal of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a management body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wished to impose the costs incurred, although it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old girl injured by a shark in a part of lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old Saturday while fishing at home in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends since half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and went to pay for it to get out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out for joy of having a take, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
As he got close to the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I screamed for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Children Council Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to the Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicates that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sansbury's hands are made low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the garnets of rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
Supermarkets are investing in the beauty market today in order to re-use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sansbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will be understood for the first time by such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, increasingly critical among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second whose opening is planned in the current of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to raise their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their online purchases and to go to nearby shops for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly resemble large surfaces, because the supermarket chain is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sansbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed the sale of common consumer goods and the cost of acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetic lines of the British chain were unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to establish a partnership with Boots, but he concluded with a controversy about the distribution of the benefits of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
It was after 3 years of selling its 281 pharmacies for 125 million pounds of sterling in Celesio, the owner of Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role that consisted of introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands into 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the beauty of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes the buying habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Anger of Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an 11 million £ agreement
Star e-mail of the Dragon's Den TV program, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the Holly Willoughby an 11 million £ contract related to his home decoration brand, to dedicate himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the interior decoration brand and True accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand in Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, this morning's animator announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the Star of Dragon's Den, angry by withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration at the last minute, to dedicate himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was angry when the cute child of the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under pressure at the headquarters of the Star's Star Empire of Dragon's Den in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, at the height of 1.5 million pounds of sterling, no longer allowed him to deal with Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The True brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the prize of the animator estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his second residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was one of Holly's priorities far away
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters is full of products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning animal, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions of people to lose their company, due to significant investments in products from pillows or candles, interior clothing or articles, and the risk of delayed launch.
Furthermore, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples shared vacations together and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animator of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A nearby source from Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but finally we are worshiped.
Trump laughed at the media who criticized him for his comment that some think "indecent of a president", and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
He's got a TV journalist's voice.
"I didn't give up anything at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-one had proved to be in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, from far away to the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at the dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho said Saturday to the world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, that he did not see any "corresponding response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain the pressure.
In his speech on the Trump meeting, he offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says the North American president.
We've been messing with the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of the missile fire tests, the release of hostages, and the remains of North American soldiers to their families.
It also justified its unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there are hardly 200 standing in front of me," he criticises, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, foreign NGOs' assistance was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was displaced, but no state of national disaster was declared, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have repeatedly made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children set up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be authorized to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant droughts, the country lacks the means to cover its natural habitats.
In Aceh, shelters have been built, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm siren has delayed in Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been placed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable amounts to report on the roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined the government of Mr. Joko, who was called to represent himself before the electors next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been chased out of their homes, as a result of confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: The attacker of Liverpool Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a failure at Liverpool in the First League against Chelsea, marking the 89th minute, Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was running from 1 to 0.
He shot in the balloon on his left before he escaped a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ends up reaching Kepa Arizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to sit down, get out of the ball, but players like Shaq are always pulling as far away as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible," Sturridge confided in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to pull."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in half after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker scored a step in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before rowing toward the ground and sprinting beside Liverpool.
Kovacic makes a fast go-and-come in the middle of the ground,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that led to Hazard in the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended his race in the row of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the Liverpool gate, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will confront the Napoleons in the group phase of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in Europe UEFA League at 3:00 this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of tsunami victims rose to 832
The disaster management agency indicated on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance report 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 that dried up the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of assaulting a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 p.m., the 44-year-old pregnant woman was found on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the inhabitants of the area who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation is just about to begin, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard whatever it was suspected of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their Dashcam and asked them to provide us with any critical information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a property of Birkenhead in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is underway and the police have indicated that they informed the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just refused access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer has entrusted the entire sector with being considered as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
saying, "it's too horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone who has information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to anonymously contact the agency Crime failure at 0800 555 111, as indicated in the register 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by his Puritan partisans, such as fanatical Taliban.
However, Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "reasonable" and described it as "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "in view of the current debate about the withdrawal of the statutes, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell's stand before the Palace of Westminster was not to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm during English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas during the previous century.
The great representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a cock kills a goat
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a cocoon in a Southeast China market.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the blood-stained artery covered near a Porkerie on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pig vaccines into a pig breed, on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He would have accompanied his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the next door was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutated the lift to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were broken and covered with blood".
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04h40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the farmer nor to his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the animal was sick to avoid any other incident and to allow police officers to collect evidence.
The family of the farmer Mr. Yuan and the market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks of pigs against people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig started a gallo lift on its tractor before his wife managed to get away from it.
In 2012, while an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his cocoons, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
"These are animals rather than players,
Very curious guys... they have no intention of doing any harm.
It is enough to show them the respect they deserve," he assures.
The remains of the Pink Hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the south-east of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is declining as it moves above the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to warnings in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category hurricane 1) since 5 a.m. on the east of Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane should move to the North on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and flows to the East, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, the Rosa hurricane will result in intense tropical humidity to the north, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with imminent depression will create widespread torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden, harsh, torrential floods and potential landslides in the desert.
The peaks will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per location, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including a large part of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains may cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised to take advantage of the desert as a result of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into chained rivers and hurricanes will produce wind flares and dust turbines by location.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country on the Californian coast.
Pluviometric totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low flow of debris and make the floor slip.
This could be the first rain of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical alerts will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rainfall at the four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Major temperature changes are to be expected for October across the United States due to Arctic warming, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or even between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a constant summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the centre and east of the United States should have a warm month start, with temperatures running around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other regions of the north-east.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average season.
The forecast for several days indicates that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first fifty-first October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh's upcoming hearings, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse is losing, the broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday's program to announce a play: an agreement by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford made sure 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had submitted himself to attacks on his person and had tried to withdraw his clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tornado, also claimed to be 100% certain that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million.
The company calculates the number of TV viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial has attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have widely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most popular channel on the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
Next CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras revealed a scene in which the senator was taking part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Commission.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
"Don't look at me, look at me," one of the women said.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are disabled."
Before the elevator doors were referred to, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network chains would cover the session live a few hours later, while the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh by the Senate as a whole.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, which minority democrats claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after consulting Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate charges of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Great Britain: May accuses the Brexit opponents of making the "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project to leave the European Union, to make the "small policy" at the expense of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on cover, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his Chequers plans, saying that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to be at the origin of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect of a fatal shot that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was stabbed and charged with murder at the second level, reported the Baton Red Police Service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the bats carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, branch of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson told the police to be responsible for the death of Wayde.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The law firm of the Baton-Red Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by an injury by a bullet that went through the head and settled in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the state police medical-legal laboratory, the South University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director Joe Aleva thanked the Order's forces for their "commitment and demand for justice".
Yeah, he was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rounds per match during the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "desolated and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're always going through this kind of event," Wade said regrettably.
Mexico : a volcano cracker of ashes
From the ashes escaping from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the Mexicans withdraw from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from the Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine layers of ash covering car pairs in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano level at 72 km from the capital since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalogue: Police and separatists face-to-face approaches to the independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona following clashes between independent protesters and the anti-emission police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided the Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by anti-emetic policemen, masked separatists threw their eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not disembark tourists.
Firefighting also occurred later in the day, while the police were using mattresses to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were scanning "neither forgetful nor forgiving" have faced unionist supporters calling for "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who had minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the 1 October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters have chosen independence, despite a low rate of participation, against the recession that has largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was involved with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for the independence of Catalonia.
"We have witnessed the last year of a great time.
My parents would be happy to be able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although small, at the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had had a hard time keeping up this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be judged for the referendum and declared the independence of the Catalonia.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who is filming the police support demonstration on her phone, thinks politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
"Tension only makes you climb," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison pending a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his candidacy to the European Parliament elections next year.
"This is the best way for me to denounce the retreat of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has brought down," he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men beating a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after having drowned several times on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m.
Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would have also been shot with arrows.
Livingstone wins match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures the victory of Livingston
Recently in grade, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 matches in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox Club.
The goal of Menga made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place themselves in 2nd position of ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which takes 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the European League this Thursday.
With regard to the Livingston team, it has extended its six-game course into the division, and its main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can argue that he has not lost the least meeting yet.
Livingstone missed an opportunity in the face of excited opponents
Holt's team could have made progress long before marking, as their direct approach would have put Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to hunt down, but remained tied to the opposite goal; followed Alan Lithgow's late intervention, on a headway by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers hold the balloon, knowing that it could generate them by working tactics.
That's where the ultimate goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and the Livingston tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to join Menga, who took a touch and entered a goal in the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense, and the target guard Liam Kelly was only rarely concerned.
The second half of the time has the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos has forced Kelly's arrest.
Allan McGregor's Rangers guard stopped at the foot of Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of Livingston's plans.
The Guardian of Livingstone rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two sentences were denied by the arbitrator, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a misbehaviour.
The Livingston - Analysis “Frequency”
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and promising results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to surpass expectations of this ascendant slope.
Their style and the composition of the team have not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit comes largely to Holt to have a team motivated since its arrival
who has many big players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and wonderfully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worall inhaled throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerard, they were not at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and failed to penetrate the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Friendly home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host her in her country.
The cliche that emerges from the protests reflects this double view of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocratic by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident took place around 10:15 a.m., near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the locations of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Kiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police reported that officers were implementing everything to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been established. Automobile drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 injured officers in an emergency
The prison manager for high-security men said that six prison officers had been injured in an accident.
The riot began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-emission agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 prisoners and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison management said: "The specially trained personnel were deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been taken care of for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-emission agents were sent to prison to cause a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Uragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden harsh (which may be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the desert of the southwest with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by harsh suddens.
The national weather service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for west Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with the adverting rains from Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service based in Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm in a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central area of the Rockies and the Great Bassin should record from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures that can reach 10 cm.
The rains of Rosa could be life-saving for regions affected by drought that are not exposed to sudden cruel risks.
Although the flood risk should not be taken lightly, the rain could benefit the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, a little more than 40% of Arizona knew at least one extreme category drought, the second most serious category," weather.com reported.
The Rosa hurricane begins its way on the coasts, in the bass-california peninsula.
Always with a great power Sunday morning and generating winds that can reach up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation may be massive and may lead to a flood risk.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and will be able to reach up to 25 cm," weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border Tuesday morning, as tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and South Utah in the Tuesday evening.
"Torrent rains are expected in Basse-California, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and constitute the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly sudden and torrential floods in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on the charge of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The adolescent was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is now stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police indicated that they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) on the night of the Radstock side.
The agents called on people who could have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh was the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the impotent and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself before Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexually assaulting him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of participants gathered in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he mentioned the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats were in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first final vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, following the statement of a member of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: There are hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunami, and the balance sheet continues to rise.
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them were driven by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake followed by a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They led many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The earthquake, of magnitude 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not escape immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone. It brought cars, wooden pieces, houses, it took everything with it," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing the trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as an enclosed water mosque.
The replicas continued to rescue the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have broadened the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found lying under the ruins of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more significant at 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dongala, the nearest epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donghala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," La Croix Red said in a communiqué, adding that her staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could well be exacerbated," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had touched Palu, although officials had stated that waves had arrived at the time the alert was issued.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building that provides a front doorway in the street with a tsunami approach.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate images.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a general electricity panel that cut all communications in Palu. It has therefore been difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to reach out to Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has returned as part of the relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: The Tsunami victims' balance sheet is estimated to be more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of the World Vision of Dongala arrived healthy and except in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters established in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explained Mr. Dosseba.
"They have told me that many houses have been destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to bring relief to the afflicted, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had no right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance may intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the loved ones of the missing would still expect a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days near her mother's body.
The trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As an ancient in the discipline of the paraffin, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when reloading an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extortioned $26,750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities is requested to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Yes
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Old known as Kanye West."
At the age of 41, West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
Its participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled her coming for "emotional reasons," explained the creator of the issue.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this nickname also has religious meaning for West.
"I think "Yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, referring to his album with his guest Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means “the only one, ” to Yes, the reflection of good, evil, confusion, at all.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, Fr. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union and the capital.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against civilians, almost fifty years after the bloody reprisals of the forces of the order against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on the place of Tlatelolco that he would "never use the military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student benefits and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the innovation leader IA by 2030.
"Twofolding IA research funds would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next major discovery in IA," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Sinovation Ventures PDG, which invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the American Othello player the best. He then integrated the management team of Microsoft Reasearch and became chairman of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and has asked when the next competition would take place to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that suits academic leaders, it's business," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on the IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support United States IA efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically awarded to researchers in IA," he said.
The State Affairs Council of China revealed its plan to develop artificial intelligence for the new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industrial and academic partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year for research in the IA.
At the same time, American legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on behalf of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voice at a referendum on the change of name of their country for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute of decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a right in its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the Macedonian slave population, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50 per cent participation required to validate the referendum.
The issue of the referendum was, "Are you for NATO and the EU membership under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
According to the parties to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
The Electoral Commission of State announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the voters who voted in the ballot.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the change of name to open the vote to join NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
At the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to receive the necessary investment. The country's unemployment rate exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Zaev after submitting his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation to 57%.
70 per cent of the participants who intended to vote said they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes should be cast and one vote should be cast.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the policy of the pro-western government since its adoption in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, breaks a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's defenses in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the world's simplest action for the player.
The Argentine butter received the balloon in the middle of the ground, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green petals.
He surrounded a defender before defeating the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling on his left.
The English front took advantage of this to send the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guardian, Mathew Ryan, with a right-hand arrow on the right side of the wire.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the chance that he had noticed at this point."
But it was Sterling who had given the first advantage to the Skyblues during the First League game,
29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second pot.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before sliding out of the ground.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the parties against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was removed from the playoff race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western National League division.
The Rockies took him 5-2 in front of the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game has no problem, we want to dig the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a starting launcher for Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
Washington's director is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 marches and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation he had given his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, referring to the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That is why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible radical group of democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means.
They care about those they hurt, those they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are tasked with "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats of people "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which he deserved to be treated by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, sure.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community that it was.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from my local party Momentum voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party who are considered not to be welcome, all for having expressed our ideas.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received the same treatment because she has been raised against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I've been censored because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself was in disagreement with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly notice said on Friday, "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night were for my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, it is not today the case of many meetings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is deemed to be acceptable by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought to share a common political vision began waiting for me to return to my dress and take positions against my convictions, whether regarding national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abuse of social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more likely than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were political.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a dissatisfaction with sexual or racist speech every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted to the series of challenging motions and changes to the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not about acting like I'm doing politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school, because thatcher's government neglect had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and by my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday, is that the country is going to a Brexit that is going to affect homes, businesses and public services.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father remaining invincible
Two late tests may have faked the final result, but no doubt above: Air deserved this triumph following the intense day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team of the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way in which they seize the opportunities that enabled them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
"So far, we have been tested, but we remain invincible, so I must love myself!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Good for them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's trial, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Air in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish team Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the figures. Jason Baggot got out of an unprocessed test.
Climo made the situation worse for Air with a penalty, before, just in half-time. He marked and transformed a solo test to mount the score at 17-5 for Air at break.
Melrose well started the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who left the ground on a civilite. During the resume, Air took the front again with a Stafford McDowall test transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, interim captain of Air, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed trial of Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having hit Climo while he didn't have the balloon, since the penalty touch, MacPherson touched the back of Air's affliction, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the resume, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry to the far end for the fifth attempt of the team home.
The Star of Still Game launches in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the Star of Still Game, decided to take a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and coanimes with his long-term partner on stage, Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the ninth show will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the next Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flowering environment of the restoration" in Glasgow.
"The sea is for us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a armoured ship in the general area of La Paz.
Public buildings are building a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea comes from right.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for Chile during a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still present. Like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
This hope has not been so tangible for several decades. Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a wide-screen basis throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will take a decision in favour of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will have to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign transition to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous charismatic president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has much to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think there is little chance that the court will speak in favour of Chile and that there will be little change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations Forum based in the Netherlands was unable to agree on a Chilean territory, and provided that it would not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated", explains Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the past four years may have even caused him harm.
"The problem of access to the sea has been averted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales saved all of Chile's good will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to trade, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will provide Bolivia with "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales - who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political nightmare.
"Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, stated that his country would not withdraw from its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri expressed himself at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two river countries.
It was expressed when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be relaunching nuclear diplomacy over three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong One, currently ruling in North Korea.
Ri states that it is "chimerical" to think that the maintenance of the United States' sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will make North turn.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious resignation to an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows reveal the latest cover trends, perhaps soon available in your store
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, don't look again.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their obsessive hat collections at a PE19 show that honored the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
More and more extravagant hats each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
The parlour of Valentino was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a wide edge evoking a pen, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
The other obsessive accessories included jewelry-made pasta, a walnut hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips ringing and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than High-Courture.
One creation looked like a dive equipment, with tubes and lanterns, while another thought like a deep ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you have a chance.
According to style observers, the top taxants could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL chapters follow the silage of the "Bomba", the wide-spread straw hat that the stars pick up, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-bear hat that has flooded the social networks has presented another of its pheasant creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathroom mannequin that carried it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the master's play of the show PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Stylist of Celebrates Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags arriving in the shops for the next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be a demand for obsolete accessories."
John Edward: Skills in languages are essential to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school directory of excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new results of excellent reviews reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and establishing a comprehensive school programme, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to establish relationships and establish a trust relationship with the inhabitants of other countries.
If you look at the excellent results of the exams this year, you will find that languages are high in ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as materials are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 revealed that 17% of the difficulties faced by employers in recruiting candidates are related to skills in languages that are insufficient.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
No matter how much you choose your career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future through this sustainable competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by 4000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not control a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be better able to find a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on traditional contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of major importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will begin with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who look at LeBron James' beginnings in the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play on Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, early in the week, James was asked to have his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Campaign of Trump and West Virginia (New York City)
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
Other scales, including states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are envisaged.
The vote confirming the vacancy in the Supreme Court is being postponed, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the vote in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. (East Time) this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of candidates' hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's vote of confirmation in the Senate should be postponed to one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans to win from the ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the President of the United States stated in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is such an essential element of its programme that the president will become in as many States as possible at this start of the election campaign," said Reuters a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media".
On Saturday, it will be the second visit in a month of Trump in West Virginia, a state that it won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is on the way in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to relaunch it in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a specialist in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hopeful of the simple approach of Sunday
After three simple, Saturday afternoon fursoms could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The movement to balance the waves is an inventive sport concept of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this.
Where, then, would they find the light now?
"They took six points forward and now four, so this gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four points of advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having some wind in the dome and have every reason to be encouraged, including by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can pretend to have got each three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be terribly effective from tea to green and set an example.
The energetic joy screams intensified as his game progressed. A crucial whore allowed him to equal the fourth part while Thomas and he were taken two down after two holes.
His whore, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, caused a similar scream, of those who tell you that he still believes the American team in high school.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on his game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players right now.
18 holes to get rid of.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the story of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European couple won four matches in four and did not have the right to make a mistake.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a Saturday afternoon bogey, but they also escaped there on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine doors on Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliberating them, designates them as the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom a potential European victory is drawn while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourballs, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine times sent Spain and Sweden into a hole they could never break.
On the other hand, on Sunday nobody is here to help you.
The furballs and fursoms are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can bask in an eyelid.
Europe has been better teamed up so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursomes session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe takes 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 in the United States during the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took over with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Well decided to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by placing 3-1 in the morning's fourballs, in front of a disturbed American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the fursoms and won two victories, but they have failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must necessarily drop eight points on Sunday 12 at simple times to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to break down four points of membership, while Molinari and he, named "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair of the Ryder Cup history to get four points during their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair of American beginners Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of 5 and 4 even more categorical.
Woods, who was trained during the two Saturday matches, shined a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven fans.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning furballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the fursomes, winning victory 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, number one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, under a fresh but free time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas drew up the reference for Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved victory at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had no more than to make a zero match to preserve its trophy.
After being a second for two days, however, they may not give up a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be possible in "no case" unilaterally.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen its confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had last year taken " important measures of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear testing and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he regretted
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known complaints from North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" denuclearization approach that North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, its statement was important that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the very first summit between an American President-in-Office and a North Korean leader, when Kim undertook to work for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected requests to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and accentuate pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposed to "the declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can cause us to rain don't know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our distrust."
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump held before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the party concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a rush."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after President Trump had described Kim as a "missile man" in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not commend this year for the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea was disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump stated that no time had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it has no importance," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo has already gone to North Korea three times, but his last trip was a bit disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight the growing machinist trend that consists of studying caffeine consumption all night.
One professor noted that most of the best university students in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is said to be the first of the kind in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on the learning that his idea came from
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why are you telling me this only last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
Spended for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee dishes, dishes, basketballs, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus containing interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of “a white night” still exists, and it adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a major problem.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, has he said - even to avoid taking weights, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in inanimate mode, making them hungry permanently.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and moved him to insist that it be offered to the whole campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar study programme before joining the institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm both for bedtime and wake-up hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : The goal of Menga causes the men of Gerard to fall
The Rangers have come up with a new blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack on Steven Gerrard's disarmed team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team was hoping to record its first move victory since its 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team hit Gerard with his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team to drift, eight points behind the Hearts, minors of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers team, in short inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now falling in sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind the Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, Arbitrary Calum Spence who had to be treated for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which shot Air in the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as for him, chose the same Livi 11 that drew a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team immerse its opponents in each turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have marked in two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on the purpose of Allan McGregor, but the ground environment let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a powerful blow in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pot
The Rangers succeeded in taking control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was sure that he should have benefited from a penalty after the frank blow when Steven Lawless and he got into conflict with him, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson had ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-frozen to choose Menga for an entirely simple end.
Gerrard responded in half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the oil appeared before Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingstone has nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long-term dances on long-term dances.
Holt's team could have benefited in the last few moments, but McGregor got a good deal of trouble to push Jacobs before Lithgow gets past the target.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was being taken with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
German: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE JOURNAL COMPUTER... was born by the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger Count has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
One man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released in the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, of course it doesn't matter, there!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
During treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognise cancer cells
This technique is to extract and modify a patient's immune cells into a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract and modify a patient's immune cells into a laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "protein causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovary, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has proved itself in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coffeinated with a MAGA casket, Kanye West was launched in a Pro-Trump Diatribe after its transition to SNL.
That didn't happen well.
Kanye West played on the platform after a chained performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to present himself to the elections in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again, West took over with the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to whites and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's a racist!"
"Well, if racism was bothering me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood video mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been disseminated, the recording of West Diatrib was released on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was gonna mock West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the hives because of his helmet.
"They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They pressured me!
And then they say I'm in a cage," he says, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, do you want to see him?" and said that he would wear his cape of superman, because no one can dictate his actions.
Try love."
His comments drew him bones at least twice on the public side and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety report. One on-site person said to the magazine: "A death silence has fallen across the board."
West had been called to replace last minute the singer Ariana Grande, whose former little friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has fired many people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: Thank YOU FOR HAPPENING TO THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the emission animator, tweeted that West was just "loyal to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and spills a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and stated that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg brought the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name as a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the screenplay of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his final blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that this type of role on the screen often brings young boys to a hard cook to respect themselves.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit indicated that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at #MeToo time.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, the Coved of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, agreed that he had "firmly" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think deeply that we have damaged masculinity."
"What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, compared to the problem they are facing now?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behavior has been conceived?
What do television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think they have to behave like this to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is, of course, something that fits.”
In the interview, he also agreed that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series would end next summer, stating that it had ended with "the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be the seer of a realisation of True West, of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that would happen to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the character lover of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV / AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its population affected by HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been substantially reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
However, from one year to the next, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected persons in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remained widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmission cases are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters deplores the fact that an employee of the GOP has disclosed data on senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the American Republican Maxine Waters reported allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three republican senators on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extremely right" websites.
"False lies, lies, and even fake lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the information released included the addresses and phone numbers of the American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie".
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information."
"This false accusation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly aroused online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press connection.
"This denunciation is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament required to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
She doesn't have to be a challenger.
She must not question the accused's motives.
She has to stay calm and calm. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the implementation of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my team."
Johnny English still hit. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, sub-doubt spy
It has now become a tradition to search for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this resume of Johnny English action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance be the new opportunity for our country to export?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with the eye scarred and face rubber, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates above all that it is a great comic created designed for a non-anglophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charmer, has a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that executes a small note in The Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in television advertising Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and that the rotor poles hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is emphasized, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and impossible Mission themselves are composed in confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more focused on children than on adults and, for me, Johnny English's colorful measles are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's moving movie jokes in Bean's character.
The never-ending premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the British spy super-secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, in the great development of the agents in service - a weakly large role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the taste that makes the vase pour out for a prime minister who is a positive character on the edge of the crisis and who already has a political impotentness: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there's no big deal to put under the tooth in the scenario.
Its advisors are informed of the information that each active spy who has been compromised will have to get someone out of his retirement.
This means that Johnny English should be disturbed by himself, who is now employed in a chic school as a teacher, but who secretly teaches lessons about how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful spells here, because English offers a high school of espionage such as Rock Academy.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and finds Bough, his former long-haired partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey baton role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who cause great distress to His Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the guise of the billionaire technology charismatic, which is said to be capable of solving Britain's computer problems: the Jason Volta disaster, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of colorful jokes: under the dequisition of servers, they set fire to a shining French restaurant; they create a chaos by fading on Volta's luxurious sailing; and English launches a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
All orders are secured for this last sequence, but yet there are not bad things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, as for Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to draw up a plan to allow British workers to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's working party needs to examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still touching the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not take place overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that will match the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers and its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
The Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the last week's Labour Conference to provide details on his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain power at the hands of "anonymous administrators" and "beneficiaries" in public utility companies.
The plans of the subsidiary also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their position, as the labourer government may operate "deductions" due to alleged deviations of conduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into corporate boards and to create an inclusive equity fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will cover up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed from at least one week after the FBI's investigation into charges against him and raised the question of whether the findings of the Office could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a public interview Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes" program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was resolved, determined, without any doubt."
However, Graham's vote appears to be engraved in the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I can't see anything else that's changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palm trees and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people heading to the Great Lawn in Central Park in order not only to enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of defenses that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or making any other effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organisation still achieve its objective in the 12 years to come?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think about making the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" on the part of its supporters, who are in favour of many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of more than $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed themselves to "helping children develop their full potential", while promising to help Rwanda 35 million pounds of Sterling to end malnutrition in this country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ulllman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions to request the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights defence movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will be able to do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animated the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner, revealed.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are located in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the event by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is defined as the "power consumers' spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
"With regard to Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one string at its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed itself to dynamizing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including American President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" in Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I think we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has generated negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to become involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting herself to the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman must be at the top," she says.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and the candidate to the Supreme Court of this one, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI inquiry before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electors did not believe that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts's "probable" voters claimed that the senator should not present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of well-known democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin during Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes back, I can relate it to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," she told the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the subject of taboo" and said about his son and other former combatants that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering whether they respect what their friends and members of the Air Force, and each other military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla's police service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of marital aggression and violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the district of Colombia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18 States and the district in Washington filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, violent gang members", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
States prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and marital violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrants Appeals Board that authorized clandestine immigrants fleeing marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the district attorney general in Columbia, stated on Friday that the new policy "does not include decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curiae friend in her memo.
Lawyers have also supported in the memory that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants nights in the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "supply the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions on June 11, in its announcement of that policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day throughout the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while double deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, in comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center of the empty city.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen going to their ruined homes, collecting property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the back and shoulders, lay in front of the Palu military hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was destroyed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris entrusted to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidating" by "advertising advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published four pages listing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to join the US parliamentary elections on 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump noted what US officials have declared to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign carried out by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "is in the process of double its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, at Beijing's press door, you will find little controversial voices and will not see the true reflection of the differing opinions that Chinese people may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path, because the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans alienate electricity from the mid-mandate election approach due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially in women, could occur during the next half-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell University School of Syracuse said "we cannot go back".
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute's efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI inquiry were enough to calm down the voter's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," she said last September 28 according to Washington's newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic report, the protesters sang "The month of November is coming!" in the Senate corridor while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"The enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be measured out," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the electors of the banlieus and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even though they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be alive if Republicans were to advance confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said early last week that "It has become a mess for the GOP".
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps elected democrats, in the television newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans appear to be divided on the credibility of the two parties, a small majority hanging on the side of the latter.
A new YouTube survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed in Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent said that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford vowed last week to the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate at the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a whole new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's solid free platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorised to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in fun that Inrupt was intended to "dominating the world".
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own online personal data store or DPL.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The privacy of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's PDG, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working contractually on the project and a voluntary coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and his team are not yet in touch with " Facebook and Google" to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely chambled in a moment.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the [inrupt] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an ecclesiastical celebration of the First World War decorated by the Victorian Cross
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and ignored that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons uncovered a memorial stone at a show in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said he was "bright symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploitation.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on Saint-Quentin's canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of cannons and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the firing line and, with the "greatest bravore", led the line before making a cannon jump to him alone and catch three detachment soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing to the height of which I will never be, but which makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the show run by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann trusted that he felt "very honored to be part of the show" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
The fans of mixed martial arts were awake all night long to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine, you spent all night looking at a filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, six of them on the main board, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK television viewers were seated when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to be awake until the first hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the passage to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Regarding the transmission, the Chief Vice-President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation has 6 a.m., this content was not adapted, so they had to go back to children's emissions."
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include future British television viewers.
“I think that when I think about the rediffusion, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning one Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went down, there were lots of messages in both ways and they weren't all friends.
We were trying to repair, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have lost everything.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" on sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley claims to have grown up sitting lower than others because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he had talked about the issue of the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular broadcaster, Kirsty Young, took a leave of several months because of her illness.
Apparatus as a shipper in Laverne's first show, Daley trusted that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed to succeed."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about their sexuality, he wanted to prove that it was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallion is now a renowned LGBT militant and has taken advantage of its participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to ask a greater number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt that he was able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion said he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old graduate last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he believed it was difficult to find someone of the same age who knew the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his prospects" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I only thought of winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal, it's Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first grade.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be here any more to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing and die so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - who accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to make it right to avoid that it is a miserable step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the 12th time, a record, was removed by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-thousand great champion shared his day between the role to bear and the punctuation of his game at the stand in order to remedy his evil.
He has never been the largest of the minors, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough is systematically punishing the beaten.
And as if the course wasn't quite adjustable in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who teamed this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple games, take a good start, the Mickelson game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tap in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has great confidence in him.
It's a legendary champion and he's added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should do it.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the biggest number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven sentences for his assets, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to laugh at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does much more than play.”
European Selection Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that an unmindable advance before the simples of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Danois competed in his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally jumped to the top of the ranking with the lowest possible distance on the finish line, with 141⁄2-131.2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were going to Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brooklyn, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but with justice," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Class victory 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to take 10-6.
The story will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep in there tomorrow.
Go there and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you've got the points on the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is where we need to stay focused.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Ravi's performances on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of stains.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that will be presented and it's different.
It's fantastic to be with a team when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're tested to the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to pass to players, it's to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he must go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk himself knew the two ends of these revolutions of the last day, after becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing at the end of the "Miracle de Medinah", where Europe has won.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how the captain, Ben Crenshaw, had done to rally his players the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've established our training accordingly and put the guys as we think they should, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple terms.
The new warship of Germany is still being postponed
According to local media, the new Fregate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman, the implementation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of all the new Fregates of Bade-Wurtemberg, was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Marine in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four boats of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing frescoes of the Breme class.
It is certain that they will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-navir missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as a radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent brakes for a period that can reach two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the constant delays mean that warships - which should enable Germany to project its foreign force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the curse F125 Fregate made major titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and material defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment in a combat mission.
The weaknesses of the software were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the Bremen class's old frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the capacity of the Navy to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the “Rehinland-Pfalz” of 7,000 tonnes weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - becomes also a problem.
It is said that it reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to $2.2 billion at the start.
The problems associated with the new brakes are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, earlier this year acknowledged that the Navy is in fact "short of ships capable of deploying".
The manager stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships had been declassified but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg Frogs could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of the storks
New research carried out in an area of the Scottish Highlands is looking to reveal how mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that comments will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano piistrels as well as brown eardrums and Daubenton in the Inverewe garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property in order to monitor the activities of mice throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of the stork crises as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their conduct on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for mice and how these are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for mice and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, slum populations have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the perch and cause the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as deadly paper and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks by pets.
The mice are not really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated education to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the mice very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspections to search and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scottish chauvres on the Thrave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which covers eight of the ten species of Scottish chauvres.
David Thompson, domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have an ideal place for nuns," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about the storks, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what the storks need to prosper."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of mice before the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without it a single nest of motherhood, the death of 400 females and small ones, or the disappearance of any local population, could result.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our sister-in-laws and, as far as many of our species are concerned, we don't know what's going on in their populations right now."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges of rape against him as “false information”, and claimed that people “want to get to know each other” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid $375 000 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing her 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, described this information as "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, and no.
What they have said today is a false information," said the camera the fifth winner of the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to make the pub by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to continue Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to a proportion of the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the past few years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 following the hotel-casino in Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting in a box at night, Ronaldo and Mayorga appear to be back in the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good man" at "99%", but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly regulation because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer, he joined the Italian giant Juve as part of a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if it had lost its status as world leader of car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK stated to the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the possibility of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures the Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that car manufacturers pose risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The production line of Toyota is operated in "tend current", which reaches all 37 minutes of UK and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured on control.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and gaps in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than one day at her factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these controls at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but other manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long the production would have been stopped, it warned, however, that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the United Trade Union at the factory and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "As I see it, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected for a week", while the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Interest in Elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstacles to the President's justice.
The question of whether Trump will return the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of carrying a micro to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
Last Monday, however, he presented himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Sunday, Trump's press connection, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we are retiring for another week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the press up."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an aberration for the "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they run away from the gallery."
Then she made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without quoting any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We have verified the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can speak to the President of the United States."
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, by making an uncontracted appearance and by the time a strange appearance before the assembled journalists.
On the concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and wish to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman sent a letter within six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, the negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and should reach decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate the extent to which I consider the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christian Abercrombie, the secondary of the Tigers of Tennessee, was urgently operated after an injury to the head on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the middle of the day.
"He came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a civière and taking it for another examination.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was no "explanation on the type or extent of the injury" and that the Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete student, is on his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five plates on the total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total from the season to 18 plates.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamps if they buy a property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasurer expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling books a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help homeless people.
This surplus - which is added to the current stamp law, including the highest levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could reach 3%.
The Treasurer expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books per year.
About 13% of the new London buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents prime access to the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, including capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy occurs only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in the stamping right to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies to maintain the real estate prices at a high level by taking over land without using them, he invited May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "real estate dissatisfaction" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rentals and the elimination of "no fault".
He would also like to give advice to the larger powers to build new homes.
May said: "Last year, I stated that I would devote my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our market for broken housing.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing property has become remote and the misery of homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland Technician Jack Ross explains that his "final ambition" is to become the Scottish selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reinvigorating the club of the North East, which currently occupies the third place of League 1, at three points of the leader.
He picked up the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the First League Scotland last season.
"I had to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following the Scottish games in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only be presented if I succeed in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's electors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician said he didn't hesitate to rank behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably not consider myself a success here unless I can get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to return from a religion in the third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the side of the religion, into a major winner of the championship next season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's support "was without a doubt a real carefour," he recalls.
"I really thought that being a coach was better than playing.
This seems strange because I've been very good at it, I've earned my life, and I've enjoyed some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of detail to fix every week.

The summer cannula has made the income of British pubs difficult, but has increased the pressure on restaurants.
The figures indicate that the groups of bars and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent of their sales in July, but the revenues in the restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Board of Directors, who compiled the data, said: "The longer permanent sunlight and the longer Britain's planned participation at the World Cup made July follow the June model, where the bars had experienced an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had suffered an even more important shock.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in June in the restoration sector only made it worse in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are the most vaguely, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that come down.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to come out for a glass.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an expert on recreation and RSM hotels, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors with regard to sales on the outside market.
It is no wonder that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% on average per annum is particularly painful, in addition to continuing pressures on costs.
The long and warm summer could not have been less timely for food operators and the time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we knew in August will give a well-deserved return."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the plant.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds Sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one child in five - some of whom are only 11 years of age - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show their parents
A child of five - some of whom are only 11 years of age - opens an account on the social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed rapid growth of Insta's "false accounts" - a reference to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a clean "main" account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “violently rape me”.
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11-18 have a double profile, half of students who recognize private accounts.
CSM head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don't find them."
Eilid Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience for ten years.
"Eilid enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and World Athletics community, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the trials of 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors have said that only time would tell whether or not I would recover.
It was a trying job, but I recovered completely, I've been able to walk again and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online, an advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a dairy company compares breast-feeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "the first silent milk shooting in the world", Elvie, a large public technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom that its new milk shooting offers to breastfeeding women.
In a cow farm full of fur, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed it, these are my breasts, not breasts."
The refrain continues: "Pow it, pump it, feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, help the women with milk."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has created an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days following their birth," one of them wrote.
Elvie milk is discreetly adapted in a breast-feeding support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It is understandable trauma to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a milk shot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "So-called off advertising."
Others advocated advertising, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarante".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still hanging out.
Pumper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a bit boring, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's fun advertising for mothers who milk their milk (usually on their place of work or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not advertising that commends the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they danced with the discreet ski-drags in their support-gorge.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use dairy milk say they have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie milk is completely silent, without children or tubes and is discreetly inserted into a breast-feeding support, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother's commented: "Elvie milk is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a funny and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie milk is making one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly settled in a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has greatly increased although the number of monthly crossings at the borders has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the severe speeches and policies of the Trump administration have made it difficult to complicate the placement of children in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by bringing a child back.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made an application for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the persons arrested had no legal precedent.
"Approximately 80% of people who are respondents or members of their families are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconference, rather than by anyone, to challenge their legal status before an immigration judge.
Non-eligible persons will be expelled quickly.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted over the past few months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw from the field.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which are trained and advised by both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the scene.
Moualem said about the refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "promoting irrational concerns" that deter refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria as long as a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fort in Idlib has made political negotiations progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "precise time" and hoped that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will be given a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal television viewers would expect him, destitution and scandal would lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At this point, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the rates at the end of 2014 have been more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large hours of listening, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the “Rachel Maddow Show” of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a presentation of the ABC's "Designated Survival" drama series, who speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a famous comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory for his part.
She remembers taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Mrs. Scovell said.
Chaos have a funny value.
Obviously, contrary to everything that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, this is far more than being an informed citizen when we look for a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his Fear book, on Paul Manafort's 15 000-dollar leather vest, and the consequences of the extravagance descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If a part of what it does gives the impression of seeing a television show, it's because it makes you feel like something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about changing teams and returning to Trump's daily situation (fighting with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the draw.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we animated all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The external money invades the most closed mid-mandate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of the congressional districts that allowed two holders to compete in the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh Bay, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who deposed his seat in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who rides heavily the new 17th district.
The cards were reissued when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided, in January, that the former rounds were unconstitutionally handled in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district led to the launch of a confrontation regarding the financing of electoral campaigns between the major sectors of party financing, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for the Republic of Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice last March at a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to the democrats.
The United States planned to penalize the Salvadoran Government for its support for China, and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management of the Trump Organisation.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to convene heads of American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, department spokesman, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions have only been imposed against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, in particular to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, including reductions in financial assistance and visa-oriented restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against the Salvadoran.
Vice-President Mike Pence has now expressed himself at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats have made known.
And the three American broadcasters are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new severe messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of the anonymity.
Their speech was corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study history
The next pillar could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also point out his investigation into the issue of the convergence of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be required to report to this body at a time when he is prepared to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes' there, and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and re-embarked the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that have followed.
The course of history revolves around these cliffs and the inexhaustible march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cliffs.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president secretly and offered assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times report was incorrect.
"What will we do if the recent FBI inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask for accounts for Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will last a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who occupied my ambassador's residence in the past.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles on the table of the Swastika.
With this legacy, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorans des Rangers, confiding to the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villareal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of its first participation in the season until match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is convinced that Rangers are able to pull the best of such a result to carry out operations.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old attacker.
"We went into the game thinking about getting something and we split it with a point.
We might have been able to bring it to an end, but in general, a match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we got back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, but I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes brought to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their retirement savings
Even though participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be taken care of, few people raised the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't want to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you prepare a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life-saving hybrid insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the pass.
Provide a health care department that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also an inquiry into your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that you pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There are only the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place. ”
A man has been injured several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air gun while entering a nightfall.
The victim, aged 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove region of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Policemen described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries didn't threaten his life, and the police called witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance sheet should be revised.
As the communications were paralysed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dongala Regency, an area located north of Palu which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis took place.
Dongala is a regency that is over 300 km (180 miles) north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, and in particular of the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times for a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic circle of fire and is regularly dried up by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main disasters and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which took place on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that ravaged 14 countries, killing 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, outside of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A earthquake of magnitude 7.5 destroyed one of the Mentawai islands beyond Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake has shaken the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes have shaken the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
Sarah Palin's older son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, aged 29, originating in Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned for suspected marital violence, contrary to a report of marital violence and arrest-resistant, according to a communiqué published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken a phone call from a woman who tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre and is under unsecured security of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, it is certain" when his appellant was asked to do so, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a class B minor offence, punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska vet court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness related to the incident.
His companion claimed he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking the violent behavior of her son with the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are on the verge and the victim's balance should be balanced in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video broadcasts on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami landed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the alleged attacker of New York who has victimized eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck hired at Home Depot to attack a cyclable track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, crashing on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov has "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and "intendedly" suffered serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intention to apply for the capital sentence filed with the South District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts of charges, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "minor preparation and pre-meditation", said prosecutors, calling the method used by Saipov "hate, cruel and devious".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in pursuit for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years that followed the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to courtrooms.
According to the police, he indicated to the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been encouraged to commit the murder after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display Daesh's flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "evidently disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to "sensitise" Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's Members suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Mr. Peter Bone, the vice-conservator, said during the walk of Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have been released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been stressed by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union that have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping his Chequer's compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of hostilities - and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone indicated at the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Cheques".
He believed that Mr Farage should have become a partner and that he should be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left," he said.
Member of Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing its opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been delivered to world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion had evolved since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to remain completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who walk the streets and make us choose first.
Quit the Cheques and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises."
"Mr. Farage indicated at the meeting that politicians should be led to "sensitize pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of confidence between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and we're telling them today, "We won't let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the popular army of this country, which has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of militants have fired conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His workman counterpart Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of the security issues relating to the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Democratic of Massachusetts discussed its future Saturday at a public assembly in the West of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice with regard to President Donald Trump, presented for the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that could confront Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked whether she intended to present herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrest at death by ball of Sims of the State University of Louisiana
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by ball of the Wayde Sims basketball player, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Red Baton Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m.H. Press conference.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Yes, 20 years old, was killed by a football Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to his head and hit his wounds," police chief Murphy J. Paul said to the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was beaten by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody for the police service of the Parish East Baton Red.
Yes, a young 2 m who grew up in Baton Red, competed for 32 matches, 10 of which are starting last season, and totaled on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading for the world title after the team's guidelines have allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became evident from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified in defeating Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's signs would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and fooled Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two towers, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the peloton's tail tower, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes went through the stands one round later and found himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeled action that saw the Ferrari pilot leave the inner part counterclockwise at the risk of resistance after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race, but now his tires aimed at speeding up and forwarding Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th turn, but was not able to speed up the pace in the eight remaining rounds, Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get one or two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual assault to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate these last days is when we see anger, when we see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they saw the disclosures and the leaks, they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't disclosed anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the Senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the escape was coming from his office.
"I did not dissimulate Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, said The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the assembly: "I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the machinery, they just know who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control," said the president in Mediate.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has set two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their match on Friday in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by crushing the match back to Dundee 5-3 last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard evened for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had fought Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed during the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage at the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford served Beauvilier who doubled the launch four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the service of Cownie, at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard once again equaled with a goal that gives a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the head for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
A Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as heroes after his death by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many others were killed after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, Antonio Gunavan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his position in the tower violently shaken at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri of Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt she was going to collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency in the country indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance would continue to grow because many bodies were still under the debris and a large number could not be helped," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies back.
The clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are picked up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived at Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia had been wiped out earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man was missing after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that was running.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane crashed trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had come too low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes says.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the plane's escapes were running.
He claimed that the crewmen had panicked and yelled, and that he suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy stated that seamen working close to the improvement of a quay had also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the land before the plane ran in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea during the last two decades, but none were affected by Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The charge acceded to his record on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the Department of Justice of the United States Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a mobile phone to track the movements of the accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which was contrary to his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was in Chambers while he was claiming to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford showed up at the Saturday bar and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed SMS, calls and coordinates from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleas Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by improvising its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip political hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom thanks to such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black?!
A New York Noun prosecutes a couple for being licensed after a "racist" text
A New York Noun prosecuted a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message by the mother who complained that she was "another Black".
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates persecution to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her confusion in 2016 by finding that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black at her arrival for her first working day.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ANOTHER NOIRE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her pocket, "bad at ease", Plasco-Faxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining that her former nephew, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Philippines instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day, then returned to her home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice is pursuing the couple in court to obtain compensation for her return and claims an amount of 350 dollars per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without contract.
"I want them to understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained in the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that she would not be able to trust him after she had done him wrong.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in the Post.
"But would you hand your children over to someone you've been immoral with, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see! ”
Assembling the trial with an "extortion", Plasco said his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," the business banker added.
While the case is still underway, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers did not identify themselves to a bear that spoke, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bear in the bush, would remain optimistic about the rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a taste of "soft-yellow" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was quite a calm man, and he wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
At the landing, her daughter had been taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowly draining and getting out of his system.
She died a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going on.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was aware," she said.
"I had my head down, and I would cry all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women deposit postcards to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who have lost themselves by suicide are trying to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed, on a gallois bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel about the daily," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and staying in Lydney, said his son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any part."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I constantly fear that there is an effect of training."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and to whom you can talk, even if he is a friend.
Don’t be silent. You have to talk. ”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was down, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we found his attitude changed.
It was at its lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She pointed out that her death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to get out of it: "It's disgusting for the family.
It destroys us.
But we must all go forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was under way while the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would not "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, or 6 November. If, as planned, Republicans carry out a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush disbanded the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and, through him, met his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We still do not know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to separate the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters "fall" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Department of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 desserts had taken place last year, against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger tariffs were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be hidden migrants rather than refugees and often raptures.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of interviews focused on the negotiations on denuclearization that remained so far suspended.
This occurred after the historic meeting of June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, has charged US sanctions with the lack of progress ever since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as " hysterical", and claims that he is unable to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as " hysterical" and stated that he was unable to sit at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have treated her as " hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he would sexually assault Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh became very emotional and sometimes failed to scream and amuse himself by referring to his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations regarding the "gross murder and coordinated" organised by liberals who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was inadvertent to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he has dealt with Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if it had been confirmed and whether the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth at Congress or the FBI, he is not only in a position to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also in a position to sit in the court where he is currently," said Pelosi.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "Isn't that wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that flow, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We will cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a frame somewhere, who told me that she would also cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and would cry: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as exuting to anger, in part because they are basically not understood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I found myself crying with an unexpressable rage, was to have been caught by the skin of an old woman - a cold manager who always had a little frightened me - who led me in a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry at all," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They believe in you sad and happy because they have you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been arrested in an extra-marriage case on board a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a mature decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been late in fundraising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her partners who normally gave $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they believe that I am entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration towards the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt embarrassed.
"You'd think I was depressed," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
"Did she cry?"
How trade between the United States and China could benefit in Beijing
The first saves of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although the battle was far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit in Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), thus charging half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, with a recent rate of customs duties of between 5 and 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will fail.
To put Washington back, it is to surrender to the demands, but to surrender publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one country or another is in fact much more dangerous than what observers previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security reflection group.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Mualem, stated that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now being met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been deserting the country since the war began in 2011.
Six other million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by fighting the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team broke the bar of the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, sank his start in the water at the 16th hole in three, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was the least well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe at all times with a total of 25.5 points of career.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to recover the cut.
What matters is that the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passed the flame to his compatriot John Ram who won the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, Sunday last.
"I feel an incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has decorated 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklus.
The United States team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've left.
Thomas's hat.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We've got to get in the way.
We're getting past it."
