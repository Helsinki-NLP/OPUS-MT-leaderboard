Traffic flow is a study of the hospitality of individual walkers and walkers between two places and the conversation between them.
Unfortunately, it's hard to study the traffic patterns because a hundred percent of the people are sure they can't estimate the behavior.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly between limits; thus, there is some sound consistency in the traffic stream and can be presented orally in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the use of traffic, relationships are set in three main properties: (1) volume, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links help to plan road facilities, design and hire systems.
