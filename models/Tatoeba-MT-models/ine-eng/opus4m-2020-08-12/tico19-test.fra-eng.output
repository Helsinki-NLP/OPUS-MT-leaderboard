Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, as well as, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 in need of care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown etiology pneumonia home was reported in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been baptised with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people affected by COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 has a more severe approach requiring hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (U.S.), and compare it with that of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons coming from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (USA) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases reported by COVID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as health ministries, national and regional health authorities from different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data have been used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to establish a comparison with Italy's experience.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 p.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The changes in the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the United Kingdom have generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative impact of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This change was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries had a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that by 15 March at 8.00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purposes of COVID-19, including for seizure tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected regions in Italy indicated that about 10% of patients affected by COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not provided).
However, there is a need for a systematic collection to complement the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed an important difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds for 100000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care for 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalised cases associated with a risk of & gt; 90% excess capacity in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since the cases were so far grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, case data and intensive care beds should preferably be established at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients affected by COVID-19 in need of care, and in particular for intensive care, as well as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, through a response approach to a mitigation approach, in so far as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases could not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country will be able to strengthen its monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The disease epidemic with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mice and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this subject of research.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will be better understood and eradicated.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, has never been observed by the Chinese, who have been forced to stay closed for the entire duration of the gold week and for weeks to come due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly approved for coronavirus (COV) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; that is why SARS-COV-2 was baptized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review seeks to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in the long run.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronary disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also make the point of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some issues still pending but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common rheumats 4.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for man, namely SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of the recent history of coronavirus.
As presented in Fig. 1.1.1 of the then unknown pneumonia homes were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical trial on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the marine fruit market of Wuhan, considered the starting point of the infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO identified the global emergency epidemic.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig. 2).
To the extent that the situation is rapidly changing, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and on the outskirts.
The mean duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 per cent CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the mass displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple brin RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the human being belonging to alpha and beta.
The Glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope is associated with angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, the genomic RNA is accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins in the form of vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, with more than 99.98% of the genetic identity of 10 sequenced samples taken from the epidemiology site, the Juanan marine fruit market in Wuhan.
The SARS-COV-2 is genetically closer to the SARS-COV than the MRS-COV.
Using the electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of the human epithelium of the respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receiver of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orphan3b as well as a secreted protein coded by the orphan8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orphan3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orphan8 does not contain known functional areas or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the CEE2 Cryo-ME structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of a Sunday and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug cribling in order to eliminate the infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Original host and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-Cov and MES-Cov came from slums and were transmitted to Man via the civettes and chamélides, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the mice have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to break the species barrier to infect the human remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from the rat to the human through the snakes, which would involve an homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, pangoline - a long fly mammals feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-COV-2 if genetic homology is judged to be 99% between a coronavirus discovered in the pangolins and SARS-COV-2.
However, a 1% gap between two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, conclusions should be expected to produce concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-COV and MES-COV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
The SARS-COV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fats, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first acknowledged by the immune system ingested by its molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
By various means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dental cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate cells B that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
T aid cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, with supplements such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized the MRS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious lung damage and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multi-visceral failure, even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is often accepted that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally than 3 to 7 days after a study of the 425 first cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic individuals from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of the COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, swelling, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat disease, rhinorrhea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoglycaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Regarding serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiographic anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had a fever of 98%, a dry cough of 76%, a dyspnoea of 55% and diarrhoea of 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies conducted on a family and on a house that was found following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilation assistance, much more than the patients who achieved COVID-19, which is consistent with higher COVID-19 mortality.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
With regard to SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat disease (13%-25%), and that ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 worldwide confirmed cases.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% from 5.71-7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 reached only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-COV-2, MRS-COV and SARS-COV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-COV-2 has a more important capacity to spread than MRS-COV and SARS-COV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MRS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The appearance of a house often occurs in a family or in a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected regions, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can be carriers of the virus without however presenting symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients can be carriers of the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most of them had a high level of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimmer rate, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Thoracic radiography abnormalities have been observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by unparalleled bilateral shadows or depleted glass opacity at lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surface rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to inflame and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocytes decomposition, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of synthetic multinucleated cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with viral infection and SDRA pathology, and is similar to that of patients with RAS and MRS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical backgrounds, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive valve within one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MRS-COV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of restored patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies are all involved in developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-COV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at an early stage and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure constitute the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extrabody membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary drain technique used to treat heart or critical respiratory failure.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive response from the immune system has been found to cause cytokine shock in patients affected by the SARS and the MRS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include the modulation of the immune response by T cells, the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, the inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, the cytokines 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids have not had any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus affecting the prognosis considerably.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate-dose corticosteroids has been recommended in patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg-induced diseases.
As a result, redesivir has also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-brin RNA viruses, including MRS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead sent the composite to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Furthermore, baricitib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury, and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of patients recovered and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have been treated with a contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Rehabilitation patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight the pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus removed from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related adverse events should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a cytokine release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the request for plasma to treat severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies sufficiently quickly to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate cells B of restored patients and identify genetic codes with relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would enable the production of antibodies to increase rapidly.
MTC has been used for millenniums in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
At present, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of COVID-19 treatment were observed in Chinese provinces that had used the MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the Hubei province, which had used only 30 per cent of the patients affected by COVID-19, had the lowest rate of healing (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and a combination of treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It has appeared that the time limit for return to normal body temperature, the time for withdrawal of symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were much shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); mortality was also lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be specified through larger-scale and more centre-based controlled tests.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 usually experience a deep concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the side effects of treatment, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact research and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for patients regarding the effects of the contagion, the quarantine, and the stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to persons in contact with these populations, and to any other individual in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates to SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animals and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to produce strong long-term neutralising antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subjected to lethal provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical trial has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SARS went away 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic MRS homes continue to be reported in the Middle East and in other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for the MRS with the help of inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective for the control of the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the significant time period (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic changes in the coronavirus.
As this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development across thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MES, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a predictive model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies carried out so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the predictive effect of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% more than 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 to 51 years), suggesting age as a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-COV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 needing intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients affected by SARS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive CCE cholangiocytes2, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a potential predictor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis was also proposed.
Furthermore, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the forecast.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially at the heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue injury.
Thus, they are traditionally marked with cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in combination with the other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in support of infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the high dose of corticosteroids has been widely used for serious cases of SARS, many survivors have had a vasculous osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and quality of life.
Therefore, when necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often have long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of loved ones or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and support over the long term in order to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of the SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively replicationd in the higher respiratory pathways and does not or does not present any symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as coronaviruses originating in common rheumats.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current epidemic of COVID-19 is therefore far more serious and difficult to control than that of the SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of the almost total population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the growth phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that the COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than the SARS, will not extend by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-COV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal cornet and the throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their exit from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode such as influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the initial estimates, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infection to eventually spread or develops into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MRS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
The SARS-COV-2 is highly transmitable by the toxins or the elongations, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, thus revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Care should therefore be taken in order to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense possible to reduce the risk of infection lies in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of 10 to 80 nm virions, with only 5% of fully penetrated virions; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, both measuring approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation bubbles to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor appeared to be infected in SARS-COV-2 even though he wore a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated his body through the eye because of inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also carry transparent visas or protective lenses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain limited to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new human virus, its high degree of homology with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China as a high alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control and Prevention Centre would reassure the population by stating that the new virus was rare, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a significant release, particularly at the time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was lacking.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data than expect formal reports of doctors or official organizations; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than to try to reassure the population; and (4) be more targeted and relevant in order to raise awareness of the population on epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the response system of society.
The epidemic of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of drafting this report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of the SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 is born as an impression of already seen.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and to treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also more important in older people.
SARS has a mortality higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while the SRAS was mostly transmitted by patients who were severely ill; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-COV-2 spread much faster and much wider than SARS-COV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may prove negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be once again positive for the virus.
This increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain pending, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses derived from mice, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropterans.
What is the intermediate species that has allowed the transmission of the virus from the original host, such as mice, to the human being?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how does the virus enter exactly into the respiratory tract cells and how does it involve pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve at the genetic level during interhuman transmission?
Is it going to evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all of these questions and to many others.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only in rare immunodepressed patients had a severe respiratory infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Regardless of the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lympopenia, false liver function tests and high kinase creatinine are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of suspected SARS.
Alleviational lesions, spread of epithelial cells, and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research on HCV.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in HCV-NL63-induced disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal collection of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is actually present throughout the world.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized man due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory disease.
Generally, when these HCVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogen.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS and are characterised by an evolving acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients suffering from MRS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MRS compared to HCV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories have been reported with a high death rate, or 34.4 %, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-COV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more communicable than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCVs (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of cells.
However, the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its long-term spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
The four community HCVs cause moderate symptoms have been well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of the previous HCV pandemics.
In order for this to happen, HCVs have to replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that make up the host's restriction factors.
In this respect, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more people infected are important, the more likely the virus is to adapt completely to man.
If appropriate, the transmission between men will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other control measures.
For many years, the four COVs in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple rhyme among immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, highly pathogens, have not been well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
The SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to the SARS-COV/MERS-COV and the four HCVs acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCVs acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to human beings and will circulate among them without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origins of HCV, it will be useful to discuss definitions and characteristics of evolving, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCV.
An animal serves as an evolving host of an HCV if it covers a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often been well adapted and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a guest tank covers the HCV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemetics.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
In particular, since 80% of Guangzhou animals have anti-SARS-COV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as amplifier mid-range hosts cannot be excluded.
These surrogate valves are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that mice are the host of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that the WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that the surrogate valves are not the immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV.
That's why mice can't be the MERS-CoV intermediate tank host.
In addition to the studies conducted in the Middle East, it has been shown that ruminants were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing the MRS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excregate the virus not only through respiratory pathways, but also through fecal pathways, which also constitute the main route of excretion of the mice.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-COV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less important than that which separates beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-COVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could both be derived from coV of chauvin-sours, while parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically associated with another COV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while chamélides were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When the HCV-OC43 broke the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-species transmission of HCV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-COV of close HCV-229E cauvre-sisters have been found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with mice in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Subsequently, alpha-CoV of HCoV-229E-related mice are numerous and non-pathogenic in mice, while alpha-CoV of alpaga has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-COV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, mice are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that mice can transmit HCV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-Cov of the mouse is used as a genetic reservoir of the HCV-229E, alpagas and drifters could be used as intermediate hosts transmitting the viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MRS-Cov.
The MRS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-sero-humans.
The evolutionary origin of MRS-CoV found in mice is known for its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present at the sidewalkers for decades.
It has been well adapted to these camels that have passed from intermediate guest to stable natural reservoir.
Unlike the role of chameleons in the transmission of the MRS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-COV is highly pathogenic in the pangolin population.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, mice may be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share an ecological niche with the mice via decomposition or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus by detoxification and consumption of meat from hives.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species, both in contact with mice and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-brin RNA viruses, the estimated COV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per site, according to the adaptation phase of the COV to new hosts.
However, CoV mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the VOCs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-COV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to man.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another close host of humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which has been well adapted to the tractors.
In theory, the genetic derivative is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, the CoVs randomly and frequently change model when replicating the NRA through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as for COV observed in animals, such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor affecting inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit means that the affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscope study indicates a 10-20-fold affinity of this relationship compared to that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Additionally, HCV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but to a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E, and silica 9-O-acetylated acid for HCV-OC43.
The diversity of host proteins between humans and HCOV natural reservoirs, such as sluices, rudders and rodents, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
New HCV Emergence: Return to the departure box
The diversity of chauveau-souris CoV offers many new HCV emergency opportunities.
In this regard, the HCOVs are the genetic reserves of HCOV.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, given the isolation of SARS-CoV-related seroviruses, but the coding of different ORF8 proteins.
This removal breaks the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presented as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in the nsp9, in most of the nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced recombination episodes between different lines, which occurred among road users in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in mice and chameleon viruses associated with HCV-229E, the alpha-Cov of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a decomposition of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the mice were infected by CoVs, indicating a mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the mice.
It appeared that the mice were well adapted to the COVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology initiated by the CoV.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and causing highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogens could also develop by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence if three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as mice and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more the pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have a beneficial effect on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is a failure in mice.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide homology coV with SARS-COV-2.
Beneficial pangoline beta-COVs similar to SARS-COV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that bine-COVs of pangoline may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-COV-2.
CoVs were returned to the ramp because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the driver for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
As a result, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MRS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MRS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MRS-CoV in camels, associated with other control measures for infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the COVs of scurvy, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of contagion arises.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of COVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
First, if mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with mice.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true midwife, it remains to be clarified how he interacts with different species, including men, nuns and pangolins.
Whether it is a nurse, pangoline or another mammals, we should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rheumat, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the rate of child mortality in domestic deliveries.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap wash.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who make nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impeptigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of hands can lower the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to ekema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dementia, and especially frequent among health workers.
Excessive hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
The deparasitation twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser as lipids and proteins, which are soil organic substances, are difficult to resolve in water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antibodies or disinfectants allows the target of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the strains may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tense agent and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts from plants).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that regular soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, tidal and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of thied water did not contribute to reducing microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mussel for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ELVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and hand soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations using benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Cinderella or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than braking them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when not available.
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to differ).
Mouse a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frosting action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and frosting longer removes more germs.
Rinse plenty of running water.
Washing in a pond of stagnant water can lead to hand contamination.
Dry with a clean tray or in the open air.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, fist, space between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and extended nail paints can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the occurrence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, flushing water from a well or a suspended and pierced well and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in rural schools or areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels often found in toilets.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and by 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying by hand with air jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the straws of 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dry-hand manufacturers, and dry-hands have been compared to drying using paper trays.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hands wet and fry.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the valve (and open the exit door if necessary).
The purpose of hand washing in health structures is to remove and avoid transmission of pathogens ("germs").
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
In this procedure, hands and forearms should be washed up to the thigh, usually for 2-6 minutes.
During the washing, it must be avoided that the water on the forearms does not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing frequency above 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing in soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fertile odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sewers in public toilets and office and airport toilets.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thinking are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after every meal.

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the virus genomes, which are very likely to result from the pressures exerted during the selection, including through the host's immune system.
For example, the complete loss of ORF4 can be cited in the HPov-229E prototype family due to a two-nucleotide deletion.
While an ORF4 could be observed in mice and chameleon viruses associated with HCV-229E, the alpha-Cov of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a decomposition of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the mice were infected by CoVs, indicating a mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the mice.
It appeared that the mice were well adapted to the COVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduce the pathology initiated by the CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting the natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mice could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and causing highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogens could also develop by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not a coincidence if three new HCVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as mice and camels.
They respond firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the more the immune response is strong, the more the pulmonary lesions are severe.
On the other hand, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have a beneficial effect on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammation is a failure in mice.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-COV-2 appeared in accordance with the general scheme by which SARS-COV and MERS-COV emerged.
While a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a 96% nucleotide homology coV with SARS-COV-2.
While civilians and other animals present on the markets have been discovered as vectors of the same virus in SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Beneficial pangoline beta-COVs similar to SARS-COV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangoline may be one of the intermediate hosts or that bine-COVs of pangoline may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was designed by man, whether voluntarily or by accident.
CoVs were returned to the ramp because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoV in mice and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCOV to humans.
Many fact-finding data have shown that SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the slurry and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civilians on the markets, the closure of the fresh product markets and the slaughter of civilians there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of numerous beta-COV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-COV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the studies to be followed.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the driver for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
As a result, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MRS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MRS, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MRS-CoV in camels, associated with other control measures for infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the COVs of scurvy, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic coVs to evolve and recombinate, causing the emergence of new coVs more communicable and/or mortal in the future in man.
The culture of the consumption of wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the disasters caused by the SARS, the MRS and the COVID-19, a better plan of preparation and intervention should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity of contagion arises.
Although mice have many positive features for the spread of viruses, the probability of man contacting mice and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of COVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 are known yet.
First, if mice transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances mice and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mice play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with mice.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true midwife, it remains to be clarified how he interacts with different species, including men, nuns and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-COV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a nurse, pangoline or another mammals, we should be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help to elucidate the evolving SARS-CoV-2 path in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for “suspected” and “confirmed” cases of COVID-19 is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCOV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest CVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge progress slowly on the basis of the results of the ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the CVID-19 diagnostic and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have met seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially amended.
Our directive, which received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and we thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Directives (SEVID-19 test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case should be associated with one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations for complete analysis, or should correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with confirmed cases of fever or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases involving COVID-19) such as fever and respiration, etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of an infection in COVID-19; (3) total number of white blood cells indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count at the start of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case shall be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) PCR test in real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody; or modification of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from a negative to a positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nuclear acids in respiratory pathways or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth edition (February 8, 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find an optimal nuclear acid detection kit for a rapid diagnosis, as well as breath samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, increasing evidence reminds us of caution when it comes to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people who did not have clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance on how to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a record of virus mortality in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of persons infected was 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined to the home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On 19 March, these three people had already been restored.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronation exceeded the million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the border of the city until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronation viruses
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCOV infection could be.
Most HCVs come from mice that are not pathogens.
Host intermediate reservoirs of certain HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of animal coV-host interactions could also improve understanding of human coV.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that mice and rodents play the role of a genetic source for the majority of alpha-Cov and beta-Cov, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-Cov and delta-Cov.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
These include HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-COVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
The drawing of the zoonotic origins of HCOV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motor forces and the restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier, with significant implications for the prevention of future contagion.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of classical rheumatic disease, including headaches, everlastings, malaises and throat disorders, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
The HCV-229E and the HCV-OC43 are both present in the world and appear mainly in the winter, in countries with climate.
Stores in Australia reduce quantity of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Woolworths and Coles store chains reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and a package per purchase in all national stores, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently collected reservations for fear of COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock breaking at the time of delivery", and described the demand for "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, described it as "unawaited".
Sales experienced a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco shop in Canberra also restricted the amount authorized to two packages last week.
In order to reduce more poverty, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector of the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores re-supply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous article, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [bought] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce the panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures the Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioneer in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because the buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Work Party.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page outline designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were at first reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, in which they announced that they did not intend to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization describes COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2).
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to encourage Governments to take action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries test, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations in response," said Pedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are very concerned not only about the alarming levels of propaganda and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a speech published by CNN in February, he stated that "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed from its appearance to its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "And we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be mastered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding the epidemic: "to make the situation worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronary pandemic is an ongoing coronary disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to touch, staying away from other people, and monitoring and limiting people suspected of being infected.
The world's authorities have responded by imposing restrictions on movements, quarantines, fires, risk controls on workplaces and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic disturbances, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other Asians of origin and appearance in East and South-East, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in atmospheric pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown cause pneumonia home on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan sea-fruit market and it is therefore believed that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to the coronation of seroviruses, pangoline coronation, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have had symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear link to the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
In the case of the first house reported in December 2019, the two thirds were linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be returned to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old in the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly to increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, including those with positive symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19-year-olds and less than 2.4% of cases in the world. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before being able to achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases indicate the number of persons tested at COVID-19, whose test has been confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to test only positive symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that up to 23 January China estimated 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections, and that these undetected infections were the source of 79% of documented infections.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first baseline reproduction rate (R0) estimates for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people affected by COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not cure, the time between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official estimates of deaths related to COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have died who have been positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it could not include untested deceased persons - for example at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the excess mortality rates during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the U.S. sub-evaluation. Such under-estimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-of-death report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to the statistics of Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide death report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the fatality report decreased from 17.3% (for those of the symptoms between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those of the symptoms that occurred after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the mortality rate (death rates), which represents the percentage of persons diagnosed with a disease and the rate of infection (infection rates), which represents the percentage of people infected with a disease (diagnosis and non-diagnosed).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination after disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the rate of infection for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on the estimates of the mortality rate.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of the University of State of Pennsylvania said: "Uncontrolled, generally infectious epidemics stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease is missing from available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen.”
China's Chief Medical Adviser Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries were able to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to eradicate the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (in perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—disappears completely" and that it "may turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of odor, swelling, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemopathy, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six is severely ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDCs) review emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and face or bluetongue; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, then researchers have issued recommendations that persons who have had close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and the onset of symptoms) ranges between one and 14 days; it is often more than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their odor was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly by close contact and by droplets produced by touching, nursing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that touching without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during expiring, especially by speaking, although the virus is not usually airported.
Postillos can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus cause air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by the cells, the risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, however spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days prior to symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you do not yet know exactly the extent of the spread of the disease, one person is usually infected with two to three other people, and the virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Exactly, the virus could be detected at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and at the end of four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that may have been affected by infected persons.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, originally isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan's acute respiratory disease home.
All features of the new SARS-COV-2 virus exist in the coronation-related viruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-COV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, the sub-gen of Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains derived from the mice.
It is the same as 96% of the total genome of another sample of coronavirus seroviruses (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the sequences of genomics between pangolin and human viruses.
To date, the overall genomic comparison revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangoline coronation virus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is performed by reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase (rRT-PCR) of infected or scan secretions.
A study comparing PCR and scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner is not used to test or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within hours or days.
Generally, this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sample, but a gorilla sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on radiographs and tomodensitometry (scan) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical asymmetric depolar glass opacitys and a lack of pleural expansion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international database of confirmed case imaging results.
As a result of re-coupling with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free imaging is limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to PCR and showed that if the image is less accurate for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, recommending that it be taken into account as a detection tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in both imaging and radiography.
The strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include having overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and touching or sticking in a mosquito and throwing the mosquito directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who had already been contaminated wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or decommunicated all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how it was contaminated. Health professionals are advised to take care of someone who may be infected to take usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and to wear protective lenses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of data on the location of mobile phones by governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for limits to such monitoring.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteering, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user close to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, brushing your nose and scratching your mouth with the bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently in the soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when the hands are obviously salty; before eating; and after being wet, touched, or eternal.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing at least 60% alcohol volume when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in a minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71 %, isopropanol at 50-100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 %, and povidone at 0,2-7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crack, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with a fold or a spoon when they touch or everlasting, and to throw away any spoon immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the posters designed by speaking, perpetual, and touching.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "to wear a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene." The use of masks has also been recommended for those who deal with a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks for healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example if they are dealing with a disease that reaches COVID-19, even if it recognized that wearing masks can help people not to touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of throwable medical masks for healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or bound places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public entry without a mask or any other means of covering its nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered that any person entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask port on interurban train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made the port of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a craft mask for those who cannot buy it.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes measures to control infections aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by reducing contacts between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distance methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting its travels, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social exclusion in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the United States government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and at least 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Adults and those affected by underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious disease and complications. They were thus invited by the CDC to stay at home in areas affected by the epidemic as much as possible. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify the goal of reducing physical contacts by preserving social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the belief that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation not to have sexual intercourse with anyone with whom we live, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to the most vulnerable groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a COVID-19 disease and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to sit in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of an epidemic are eradication or eradication, and mitigation.
Endangerment is established during the first phases of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate the infected, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Contingency and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to address the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what we call the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and makes time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masks and individual quarantine; public social distance measures such as closing schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; as well as environmental actions such as cleaning the surfaces. More drastic measures aimed at smoothing the epidemic have been taken in China as soon as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and quarantine, and has issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have become quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the provision of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that the slowdown (slow but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and the elimination (reversing the development of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and death by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The elimination may be privileged, but must be continued for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs in the first instance), because, otherwise, the transmission is rapidly rebounded when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without an order against rheumatism or alcohol consumption and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may make the results worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and handicraft medicines" may reduce the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in the capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients affected by COVID-19 is described by WHO as a key response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by cancelling non-emergency interventions when possible, by separating and insulating patients tested positive to COVID-19, and by strengthening their capacity for intensive care through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories about the place of origin of the first case (called a zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could be returned to Wuhan on 1 December 2019 in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the large market of Huanan marine fruits, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, which informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were accused by the police of spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was charged by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan's health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. In the first phases of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Chinese Year's migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pole and a major railway destination.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases on one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by displaying the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were cured.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movements and established border controls.
National responses included measures of exhaustion such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or bordering orders) and fires. On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were subject to a form of bordering in the United States, more than 50 million people were confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world knew a form of bordering, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would go back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home for unknown cause pneumonia on 26 December, which she informed Wuhan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
Initial patient genetic tests on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan were warned that they had "prepared rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "manifest evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "war of the people" to induce the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine of human history", a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the New Chinese Year (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built as follows: Leishenshan, in order to treat additional patients.
In addition to new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to initiate the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of spring holidays.
The universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been established in several Chinese regions.

The methods of detection included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, virus detection devices issuing the results the following day, and an increased test capacity to allow the test to be performed by nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in the control of the epidemic, although it did not put in quarantine the entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided into the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.

A report by CNN indicated that the combination between the important elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all persons affected by the virus to date could have contributed to the high rate of mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus was first seen as one of the most flexible of the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had imposed no form of social distance or a measure of forty mass to its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and vitality in response to public concerns.

Despite this, the United States has taken time to start testing, which has hidden the true spread of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were carried out by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the absence of federal approval for non-governmental (university, business and hospital) screening kits until the end of February and restrictive criteria to be able to claim a test by the beginning of March (order of a mandatory doctor).

On the other hand, Chinese assistance has been well received in Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and eradication of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of dissipating efforts to prevent and end up, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic in the wake of the New Moon Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that although it was not "a recommendation from WHO of course", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the most concentrated epidemic" and spoke of a fact "without precedent in the history of public health". On 30 January, following the confirmation of an interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic constituted an urgent public health emergency of international scope (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the 2009 outbreak of flu A.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of movement restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason for measures to interfere in vain with international trade travel and trade" and "the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute up to $675 million to support strategic preparation in low-income countries, calling for the urgent support of those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect persons who have contracted the virus, even if it was on display".
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our lowest e-mail" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow". On 11 February, WHO established a press conference that included the name COVID-19.
On the same day, Pedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the overall response of the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide their expertise to manage the wider social, economic and development implications of the epidemic".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was activated in China to accelerate international experts and WHO on-site in China to support national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in the urban and rural environment". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", indicating that although it is too early to talk about pandemics, each country should nevertheless enter the "preparation phase".
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint on-site mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the assessment of the global coronation-related threat was from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO emergency management program, said in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you must be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then stated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement meant that "we accept in absolute terms that every human being on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be qualified as pandemic.
The Director General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction". WHO has faced important criticisms regarding its management of the pandemic, considered inappropriate, particularly due to the late statement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative response was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts focused on respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Experts stressed that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, elderly persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations face the economic and social impacts of the crisis of COVID-19.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of Michael Gove and the son of the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) have been reported for their functions following their management of the quarantine in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from the popular anger in relation to the coronary plague.
Some high-ranking Chinese leaders, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronary virus epidemic would have started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would keep its origins from the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has described the coronation of "Chinese virus" or " Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has now become a global pandemic", which has been taxed by some opponents and aimed at "disturbing the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast has provided a telegram from the U.S. government setting out the main lines of a communication strategy that appears to come from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including during press conferences and television apparitions." Press agencies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a campaign to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "generosity policy".
Borrell also stated that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner”.
China also called upon the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending priority to aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting assistance from other nations to their own country.
Other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of breathers for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by the coronation virus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said that "China alone had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high political source" that indicated that 80% of Russian aid was "not even useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio denounced media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medical aid plane to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said that "by offering his assistance to his American colleagues, [Potine] shares the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have gained speed, they will be able to do so if necessary."
NATO's military "Defender 2020" exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's greatest maneuver since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticised the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many European participating countries, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with almost twenty members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political personalities.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders to seek help on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country had a problem fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called for the United States to adopt common social policies to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal children's care program, a paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's reelection chances during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan's "forty-and-a-half efforts" after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in forty-two weeks on government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided into the response to the crisis of President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be accused of mismanagement of the government's epidemic or to pay for its reaction. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt an emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until new order, to suspend parliament and elections and to punish anyone who would have been accused of spreading false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruption, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and an interruption in the operation of plants and logistic operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increase in consumer demand and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of first-time products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, and scarves.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the application for individual protection equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This application resulted in an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also resulted in a shortage of individual protective equipment worldwide and WHO warns that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trafficking of essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its important agricultural production, Northern Italy has not found a significant decline, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays have been emptied only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government have opened up pig reserves to provide adequate support to the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy have been felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales have dropped by 20.5%.

Many think that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in due time by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to the bans on travel, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of governments against all travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has never been seen before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with New Chinese An.
A number of events involving important crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Moon Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until 10 February, imposing on most of the workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The distribution sector has been hit at the global level, with reductions in opening hours for shops or temporary closures.
Business visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a 50 to 60 per cent decrease.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43 per cent drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people with extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs during the outbreak in Wuhan.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers have been trapped in domestic or landlocked provinces in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The Indian border has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) to unemployment. Angus Reid's survey observed that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their employment in Spain since the border imposed by mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees grounded to a part-time activity plan funded by the government called Kurzbek.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both waged and independent, at the global level.
The arts and cultural sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (usually funded by the State) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public and support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world were closed to new orders and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The cinema industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place last week of the Christian period of the Carème, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, and on-line or television while others propose to practice their worship on "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square, which had been emptied of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also cancelled their services and limited public assemblies in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League of Champions, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 season of the LNH.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other world-wide casinos closed and the live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to sign up online, and many online games sites have found a significant increase in their number of new entrants. The world of the show has also been touched, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" designed to make artists perform, broadcast and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet posts on the theme of the coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction over uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a resurgence of prejudices, xenophobia and racism has been found against people of Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dated February (although most cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a warranted punishment.
Some African countries have also found an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to sensitive new countries, Italians living in the first country of Europe to suffer from a serious epidemic of COVID-19 could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has raged over Twitter.
The Chinese and the other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in the levels of racist insults and aggression.
American President Donald Trump has faced criticism of having described the coronation virus as "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, who share a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronary plague.
The president of the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which describes them as "false". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were exposed by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign wastes" which should be "emissioned".
Many access papers paid have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory detection of coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods of virus detection and detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too light to be reported or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited detection, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngitis ecovilion or the waiting sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngitis is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Then, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken in deep respiratory pathways by aspiration catheter, or a crates (expectation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using an inverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), and constituted the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency authorisation of the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their real-time RT-PCR diagnostic device to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test of three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a test clot to the Atlanta CDC. Therefore, an average of less than 100 samples per day was successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it is only at this time that federal and local laboratories have been authorised to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorisation.The US commercial laboratories started testing at the beginning of March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced availability at the national level of COVID-19-based RT-PCR-based tests.
This Diagnostics has also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and treatment of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test in COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out in large quantities within 3.5 hours, allowing for approximately 4 128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isothermal amplifying technology for nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically related to the nucleocapid protein (protein N) of the new coronary virus is under development in Taiwan, hoping to provide results within 15-20 minutes, as a rapid flu test.
A bibliographic study in March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary radiographics have a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive even before symptoms occur."
Typical symptoms on the TDM include multi-lob side glass opacitys with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Sub-pleural predominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imagery results coincident with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TDM is not used for screening or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".In March 2020, CDCs recommend PCR for initial testing.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to the infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity and within the framework of population monitoring.Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (TLC) or by test on the patient's hair (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
High-voltage automated systems from many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, a single sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For the POCT, one sample of blood is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to analysis.On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have informed the agency properly and which can now distribute their antibody screening tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test kits capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the PCR test of the viral RNA.
The antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan where the suspected cases may remain at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", the patients crawling inside, sending it back and receiving the test result later. British NHS has announced that it conducts a pilot project to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will not infect others by becoming hospitalized or needing to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the COVID-19 test for suspected cases, a health professional takes a sample taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres enabled South Korea to conduct one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Disease Insurance Doctors stated on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
Costs are covered by sickness insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technology and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the same time, bringing together the samples and only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this detection capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities as a whole.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Origami Assays developed free models have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without a liquid-manipulating robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reactive have become an obstacle to mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine protocols for the preparation of samples which involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes to continue testing.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was currently testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and was about to intensify the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive tests and the purchase of a high-flow laboratory at the population level with Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for producing low-income kits that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centres was published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the testing kits at the start of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to respond to the demand and recommendations for testing of health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronation virus.
The detection capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programmes as a better way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The strong demand for large-scale virus spread has led to the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of fossils and chemical reactors have been exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs had "defects".The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that impeded private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would remove the missing kits and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Turkish Health stated that the test kits that Turkey purchased to China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits to China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were useless.
The screening, followed by forty of those who have obtained a positive result and the tracing of persons who have been in contact with the carriers of SARS-CoV-2, has produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death related to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of about 3,400 people, within about ten days.
Nearly half of those with a positive outcome had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movements in the community, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 crown virus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less rapidly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools opened at the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive borders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that had performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only slight symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Possible in % of Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that does not test that persons admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other factors are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is done by cleaning your hands to remove salads, fats, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted via the oro-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or rheumat, for example, by not washing your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning the cheeks of a baby or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you don't have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands on the ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
After changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after wetting or tossing/eating;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the rate of child mortality in domestic deliveries.
According to a 2013 study, the improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap wash.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by close to 50%.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhoea episodes by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands in soap reduces diarrhoea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRAs). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, who make nearly 1.8 million victims a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilets can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the deaths due to diarrhoea and one quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects from impeptigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent washing of hands can lower the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing could lead to ekema or dermatitis at the hands level, characterized by squamous skin and dementia, and especially frequent among health workers.
Excessive hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands in the soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (micction, defection), after cleaning the cheeks of a baby (or changing its beds), before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly to prevent transmission of diseases, including before and after having treated a cut or wound, after having eternalized, touched or wetted, after having touched animal waste or manipulated animals and after having touched orders.
In many countries, soap hands cleaning is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 with 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of a table (77%) and China was showing the lowest rate (23%). Today there are several methods for changing the behaviours and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In developing countries, it is also advisable to offer schools to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day in order to make children habitually do this.
For example, the Department of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "primary health care program" to promote children's health and education.
The deparasitation twice a year, associated with daily washing of hands in soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the micro-organisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser as lipids and proteins, which are soil organic substances, are difficult to resolve in water.
An adequate flow of water, however, facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are dumped with the mouse.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that “automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable”.
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health status.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antibodies or disinfectants allows the target of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which are resistant to many types of organisms.
Therefore, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, the strains may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tense agent and skin protector, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts from plants).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's Public Health School indicated that regular soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, tidal and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils with salads and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of thied water did not contribute to reducing microbial burden on the hands.
A disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the twenty-first century, non-aqueous hand hygiene products (known as hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or mussel for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ELVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present in the hands 1 minute after application.Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The thumb and back of both hands, as well as the interstices between fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, should be lined up until the liquid, mousse or gel dry.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are clearly salty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of micro-organisms; however, they must not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and hand soap.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emulsifiers caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions tend to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing in water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove the organic matter on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since they remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends heavily on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, the formulations using benzalkonium chloride have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness is reduced after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means to buy soap, and who use ash or land instead.
Cinderella or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases rather than braking them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when not available.
The United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper washing hands to prevent transmission of diseases, as follows:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not appear to differ).
Mouse a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frosting action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and frosting longer removes more germs.
Rinse plenty of running water.
Washing in a pond of stagnant water can lead to hand contamination.
Dry with a clean tray or in the open air.
Wet hands and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, fist, space between fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and extended nail paints can accommodate micro-organisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; skin dryness promotes the occurrence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, flushing water from a well or a suspended and pierced well and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in rural schools or areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a rope, and a pedal that allows you to pay a small amount of water on your hands and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is to discuss.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric towels often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air jets.
After the washing and drying of hands in the hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the thumb pulp and by 254 per cent on the palms.
Drying by hand with air jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp of 42% and on the straws of 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper tray, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on average on the thumb pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which breathes air out of the appliance at an announced speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling the micro-organisms of the hands and the apparatus and possibly contaminating other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment in a diameter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows the spread of micro-organisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dry-hand manufacturers, and dry-hands have been compared to drying using paper trays.
Washing hands with disinfectants is an alternative during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The washing of hands in the medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of hands must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hands wet and fry.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing through the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean dish.
After drying, the paper tray must be used to close the valve (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting back into contact with the surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health structures is to remove and avoid transmission of pathogens ("germs").
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which facilitates the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from internet users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
Commercial devices can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicines or antimicrobials) provides the hand washing agent with an action to destroy the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "break" hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching them with your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing them, a sterile brush to fry and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
In this procedure, hands and forearms should be washed up to the thigh, usually for 2-6 minutes.
You don't have to shake your hands for 10 minutes.
During the washing, it must be avoided that the water on the forearms does not flow to the hands.
Once hands are washed, hands should be dried with a sterile garment and a surgical helmet should be inserted.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the wash, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the hand washing frequency above 35%.
If hand washing is compared to an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A virus (H1N1) and difficult clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care facilities, it is possible, among other things, to train hand washing personnel, to make more alcohol-based products available to the patient and to send him written and oral reminders.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap washing is considered to be a low cost and essential tool to preserve health or to eat properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits rather than to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap-washing and awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, convey the benefits of this practice and lead to a change in long-term behaviour in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation activities are needed to complete this approach.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to the promotion of hand washing in schools, one can cite the example of "The Three-Star Approach " of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand hygiene campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural development.After the 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies examined the overall cost-effectiveness report of hand washing in developing countries compared with the number of years of good health earned (i.e. avoidable DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing in soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have recently been hospitalized or injured soldiers, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nurses" in Britain.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fertile odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of porcine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to a greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to take care of these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to the sewers in public toilets and office and airport toilets.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It is derived from a Bible verse from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is busy washing her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her bad conscience with regard to the crimes she committed and that she has urged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some people, after remembering that they had committed acts contrary to ethics or had planned to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thinking are less inclined to take other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of the use of water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the rituals of washing hands in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and the Woodhu in Islam. The religions also prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is obligatory to wash your hands after going to the toilets.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after every meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls on the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace refer to the implementation of health and safety methodologies for the control of risks for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest risk exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic anti-infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label and maintenance of a clean and routine disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contacts with people without a COVID-19 suspected or known, but may be infected due to a Community transit or international journey.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume detailed environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic glasses, and the provision of individual protective equipment in case of encounter with a person affected by COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19 as presenting a high risk of exposure, going to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen sick, have to take care of other people or fear a possible exposure.
Commercial models can change, both with regard to the goods requested and with regard to the means to acquire them (in particular to run their races outside the peak hours or to use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and community context and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also forget the controls necessary to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Plans for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be recommended nationally or regionally.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of the highest risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy is a global framework used in health and safety at work in order to group effective risk control.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally by individual protective equipment.
Technical checks involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour; they can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in employment policies or procedures that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual Protection Equipment (EPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI shall be selected according to the risk to the worker, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or subjected to any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and minute washing of hands, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose for touching and elevating, providing mosquitoes and garbage, preparing for work or working hours as needed, deterring workers from using other tools and equipment and maintaining the cleaning and disinfection of the working environment routine.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that workers with acute respiratory disease symptoms remain at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptom since at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other medicinal products acting on the symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible disease leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs involve those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of persons without a COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to a community transfer in progress around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with a widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume detailed environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastics and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of person meetings by virtual communications, the setting up of extended working hours, the interruption of non-working travel and the installation of non-essential areas on the basis of employment plans and the provision of assistance to agencies, including agencies for the development of emergency services.
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the disease from the other by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to take care of the disease and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with mosquitoes when it touches or lasts.
The cabin crew shall carry medical gloves which are cast when handling a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other disposable articles must be placed in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and the contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include the postponement of the journey in case of disease and the automatic isolation and immediate information of the medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring must take place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare facilities, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has entered a school building, regardless of community distribution.
In the case of minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, assemblies and other important assemblies such as physical or corral education courses or canteen meals, by increasing the space between offices, by scaling up the hours of arrival and departure, by reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate nursing facility for children with flu symptoms.
In the event of an important transmission in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, an extension of school vacations can be considered. For the order forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Officers of the command forces who must contact persons with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the port of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service compartment before reuse by means of a brush or spraying detergent house and follow the standard procedures for demarcation and reception of used EPIs, as well as for demarcation and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be of high or very high exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Procedures producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk funerals include workers involved in the preparation of human bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when conducting aerosol production procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients enter separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPOs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who perform aerosol procedures.
In the United States, N95 filtration respiratory masks approved by NIOSH or higher shall be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect breathing samples, take care of or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective lenses or a facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of procedures producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a site occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his care, using the necessary EPI to the specific task only, continuing use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of EPI and deterring the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare the future
DATE/ DAY OF REVISION : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is a clear demonstration of our global human connection and of our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and strengthening of the Community at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and well-being that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable witness to the incredible human beings we have the chance to work with.
I could not be more grateful and proud to all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared her gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play here, we will make adjustments as a result of how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this discussion, we considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We were primarily concerned with eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff members, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work time target will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until a new order.
We will not declare a holiday: if you are able to provide more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the present time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, run a race or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say it.
No disease arrest or paid leave required: just prevent your superior and help your team to revise time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have a positive diagnosis at the COVID-19, please avoid Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department so that the T&amp;C helps you and ensures that your situation gets the necessary attention from the management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we will reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow staff members.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their work as a means of eliminating their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we are waiting for and can take the necessary steps.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust & Amp; Funding Security and Collection teams (among others) carry out an essential work that may need to be strengthened.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each and every one of us, we're just going to focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt any longer.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to catch the lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to take additional hours to comply with currently unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new objectives and timetables where appropriate.
What is the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, to take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of the deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with excessive caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They have used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator boxes leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which shared with us and with all staff based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our habitual colleagues at remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce meeting time to a maximum of one hour or two.
If longer meetings are needed, consider assigning them in several days.
To clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and forward the documentation.
Make videos the norm, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instantaneous conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for breakfasts.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community subsidy to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Edith-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understood that our applications for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be punished in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both of sadness over the upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As far as possible, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns all of us and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all the information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about moves, events, important workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations HR.
None of these changes should be regarded as abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is to recognize that our work and our obligations will probably have to be adapted in an unprecedented way at the present time.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to help our movement, and to provide the service that everyone can rely on to the world.
Our planned work will be here to wait for us at the moment.
For now, it is time to step in and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to get there, that's why you need to protect yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself at the time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).

The human version of the enzyme is often designated as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a Peptide N-termination M2 and a C-terminal amino acid transporter.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein whose active enzyme field is exposed to the surface of the lungs cells and other tissues.
The extracellular area of the ACE2 is elevated from the transmembrane area by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: the ACE2 is primarily related to the cell membrane of type II pulmonary cells, the enterocytes of the grilled intestine, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the arterial cells of the soft muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 RNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
The ACE binds the angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
The ACE2 binds in turn the amino acid phenylamine at the end of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cause several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral SLC6A19 amino acid carrier and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronavirus cells, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SRAS-origin virus) ; and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 specular protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzyme field of the ACE2 to the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in both virus and enzyme transplantation in endosomas within the cells.
This entry process also requires the start of the S protein by serum host protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently the subject of investigation as a potential treatment. This leads some to think that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells may help to fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continued standard treatment with the help of ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the evidence subjects."
In addition, "pneumonia risk has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with CVA and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less evident than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 recombinant human (rhACE2) is present as an innovative treatment for severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the porceles of acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (lasting) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for people who are intolerant to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRAs) or for patients with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 by infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronary pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (“contacts”) who may be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and in some jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed to design contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on the geographical location of application users, raise issues of privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality that will support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as far as it is concerned, chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it was provided in an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures the tracking of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced development stage and could be deployed over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering setting up applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geoperage application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, raised a number of possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Some private life-protection activists have expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such monitoring.
These organizations laid down eight conditions for compliance with government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of control and surveillance should include exclusion clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse should be provided;
The “significant participation” of all “stakeholder stakeholders” would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, both eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to gross geolocation data present important potential privacy issues.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows respect for privacy (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected tracking information from various sources, including data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they have then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made information of localization accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of the profound changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of the MRS affected the country.
This information is accessible to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The drawing of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the proximity of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols encompass Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that the identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matching devices are carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy techniques in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace Platform, a company that develops privacy technologies based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition TCN was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alert applications, a key factor in their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that would enable it to preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official coronavirus-respecting private life tracing applications
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system by updating the operating system and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Reposition of a medicinal product (also called reorientation, reprophylaxis, re-appointment or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of an approved medicinal product for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfer of plasma of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each having several binding sites.
Analysis of these link sites offers the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaine type protease, NRA polymerase dependent, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is also an antipaludene medicine used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that the associated chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four medicines studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquin phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the US only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have indicated using this medicine "when there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a safety and efficacy test for the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen indicated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Agency for Medicinal Products has reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicinal product is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to care for patients affected by COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump to take the medicine. The medicine can be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to produce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded "that no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by linking it to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for drug repositioning specially developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filos, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that re desivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by the University Hospitals of Cleveland; one on people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on vitamin C intravenously for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controls against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The State of New York started the trials on azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on Teijin alvesco (cyclosonide), a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronary virus.
An angiotensin converting enzyme form 2, a phase II test is in progress with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 years and over who have been diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish instructions on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for prior epidemics such as the MRS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical trials, many development attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus of disease origin at least 18 months ago.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic occurred worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECIP scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were carrying out research and development projects at the beginning of 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform in Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate : CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovarial vector)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at the first development stage of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) are confirmed as assets and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A Phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and conducted in several centres, all with more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a group of witnesses, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the assessment phase on the human person (research "preclinical").
About January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular-pink vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a Quebec biotech company, indicated developing a coronavirus-like particle through the partial funding of Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong amounts of money to gain exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19", which caused the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a NRA vaccine.
The candidate for BNT162 NRNm-based vaccine is currently in preclinical phase with the beginning of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian company of biotechnology, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of his final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Epidemiological Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium to seek a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total ECPI investment into the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to 29 million US$.
The other ECIP investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started tests on the animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifier NRA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the shipment of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including a number of Vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
About the same time, the Canadian government announced an allocation of $192 million for developing a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to establish a national "bank of vaccines" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School indicated PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, saying that "subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 administered by micro eagles triggered an important response to specific antigen antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
With the aid of bacteriophageals, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce in offensive particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-based IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia is planned to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective during development.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement level 3 biosafety limitation measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MRS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS which has both demonstrated its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MRS.
When the MRS spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could be used as a model for developing vaccines and anti-MERS-CoV medicines.
In March 2020, one single MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in man and three other vaccines were currently underway; all were viral vectors, two were adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and swelling.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in moderate symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by drops produced by touching, nursing or speaking.
These droplets are produced at an expiration, usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than present an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the infection is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommending their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, swelling.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties in breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, walking difficulties and face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as elevation, nasal flow or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, the failure of several organs, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that all infected people will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary elements suggest that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptom infected people is currently unknown and studied. Korean Disease Prevention and Control Centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections detected today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectation and saliva can both carry important viral loads.
The fact that you talk much frees more drops than the fact that you talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that touching without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors located in the corridor outside the patient rooms produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-animation (RCP) can spread respiratory secretions and thus cause air propagation.
Although there are concerns about the spread of seals, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if you do not yet know exactly the extent of the spread of the disease, one person is usually infected with two to three other people, and the virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus could be detected at the end of one day on the carton, at the end of three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on copper at 99%.
This varies, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, thus deactivating and eliminating the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five patients out of six, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus related to nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-COV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spicule (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan hospital in China and are more common when the disease is more severe.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial lesions may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients with COVID-19-infected intensive care unit and may be associated with unfavourable prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
These are in particular GM-CSF secretive T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or waiting sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken within two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction tests (PCRs) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development but were not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed only 60 to 70 per cent accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test at the nearest patient on March 21, 2020, to be used at the end of this month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobular glass opacitys with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the start of the infection.
pleural domination, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar supplement) and consolidation may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleural, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, atypical atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
Pneumonia in the course of healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavitys and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuko-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding bottled places, often washing hands in water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mosquito when it is touched or everlasting and using the inside of the thigh in the absence of a mosquito.
A proper hand hygiene after touching or everlasting is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered by a fabric in public places to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and canceling important groups of people.
The distance directives also include compliance with a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known drug to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemimatic peak, which is also called "plating the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently in the soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilets or when the hands are obviously salty; before eating; and after being wet, touched, or eternal.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for hand-based alcohol containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where hand-based disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulae for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an active antiseptic substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and the support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carriers of the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extrabody oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy nutrition were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of persons hospitalized for COVID-19.
Reanimate and Pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in conditions of care where the implementation of procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an insulating chamber adapted to airway infection (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and airway transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the individual protective equipment (EPI) guidelines during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (in facial masks) are privileged.
N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or last resorts, handicraft masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal tube or positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is unknown whether one or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal tube. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted into intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during the COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering high pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen output and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are the subject of clinical trials.
Redesvir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several currently tested drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antivirals may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to plasma of validated persons as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "near contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quantain, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of massive data from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of suspected persons with the coronation virus.
The measure was aimed at respecting the quarantine and protecting those who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate data on telephone location with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that he had been informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 per cent of people continue to move".
The German government spent a 48-hour hacking weekend with over 42,000 participants.
The Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronation virus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increase social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have moderate changes with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 according to data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data are missing for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly advance to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney and liver injury.
Coagulation disorders, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal failure observed in 4% of the patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have a high rate of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of between six and 41 days.
In a study by the National Chinese Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples present widespread alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high levels of troponin or a cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing diseases. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The numbering of moderate cases may lead to a reassessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and were at a higher risk of intensive care or death than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration has observed a 20 to 30 per cent decrease in respiratory capacity in some people who are cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to an intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had long-term effective immunity in the health care sector.
Immunities are considered likely to be based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of patients treated with COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an exacerbation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by the spread of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively caused by a human transmission to humans.
A study of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary in regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO has assigned the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for confirmed deaths in the SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COVID-19 diagnosed with a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in the SARS-CoV-2 confirmed laboratory. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time period.
According to statistics at Johns-Hopkins University, the worldwide death/case report is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed who die from the disease and the rate of infectious mortality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnised or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination after disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 have not been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been started.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, the difference between men and women who are only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent in men and 1.7 per cent in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government did not collect data related to COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS differ between men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means crown, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), to an animal species or to a group of persons, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, in China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended using provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCOV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
In view of the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment as well as spare parts and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency breathing valve and the supplier could not provide it in due time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on S-specule protein that helps the virus to infiltrate into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid-based vaccines (ADN or NRA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines resulting from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven studies evaluated treatment already approved against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on re desivir in several countries with reports expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of vaccine and medicinal products against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of redesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with redesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some are requesting an independent analysis of research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that the double dose is highly dangerous and may be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by means of an emergency authorisation for the discretionary use of doctors caring for patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin, or amifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the follow-up of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial specular protein starting with serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE receptor 2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at subsequent stages of the COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-chocdal properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines for treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study has been conducted.
Phase 2 tests are under way at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in individuals with a severe form of disease.
Associated with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokinic shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to be the result of the death of some affected persons.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the syndrome of refractory cytokines reduction to steroids induced by a different cause, treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of CSC.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of persons who have cured COVID-19 to persons who need it is under study as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are under development.
The serum production of convalescent individuals, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, then contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
