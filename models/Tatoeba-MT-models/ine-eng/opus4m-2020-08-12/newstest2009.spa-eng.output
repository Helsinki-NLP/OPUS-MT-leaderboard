The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ operations reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday's trade, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell by approximately 6 per cent.
The drop this time is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
It also expresses the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives which refused to support the plan for stabilization of the Secretary of the financial sector.
Dropping of shares in Asia
The shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the index finally softened part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked almost four per cent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing down by almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by 3.8%, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sidney's Stock Exchange has lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses have dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Secretary of the Index, went down to 3.6 percent.
"The ransom actions programmed in the United States are insecure and this affects the financial market of the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Coin Office Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, independent of the Central Bank of China.
The interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
In other words, there is a threat that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial support plan to which $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions lived in a bloodbath and mainly the stock index collected the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent. A similar decrease in volume was last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the Assembly proposal was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: The U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a comprehensive agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have created a gap in the discussions on the adoption of the ransom plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with an amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion).
However, it is not yet earned.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can publish the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He told the agency Reuters, Barney Frank, president of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the ransom plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disastering" will be achieved through the complex mechanisms that the market will also achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolve our discrecent views on how the market stabilization package should be implemented" said Democrat Nancy Pelosía to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the Government Fund.
It should buy from financial corporations unsold mortgage assets that lead financial corporations to long-term losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already on it," Paulson said.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the stock market that is rapidly decreasing.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing their utmost to ensure that the Congress will finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to calm down the business of investors in front of the Asian finance market, as these are those in the first hour and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, there is now nothing clear about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even if they will not stand in the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it felt that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would amount to another $100 billion and later to the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President may veto this decision but Congress may exceed its veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the purchase of bad mortgages whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to end up paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy".
Limitation of the bonded contract
The chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, chief of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the programme's money for the protection of taxpayers' taxes, a relaxing closure of the programme's financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and set up a committee to have control of the Fund.
He should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also has to help home owners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments that it purchases in order to lower the monthly charges for payments within the deadlines of debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the economist head of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will happen but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and what price problem assets will be bought at.
This will be crucial for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or in the beginning of next week, according to Marek, it is not so relevant.
"More importantly, this week Congressmen agree on their support and give you a good vision as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that comes to that approval is, at this point, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed hand combat: MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost everything mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to buy only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demands of the future owner.
It'll probably be hard to buy the most modern toy to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP discs are no longer out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not even one objective reason for continuing to understand them.
If the vinyl discs with music of art rock, jazz or blues are swallowed in their barns, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this kind of music.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just like for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the 20 crowns of the market.
Two ends, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which not even most of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as phone call, texting, can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and can even navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle because no fridge knows how to make a whistle and no television can take pictures.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
How many more functions are used on the mobile phone before the display indicator will be lit by requesting it to be reloaded.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy tragedies.
Few mobile phones can play more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly greater performance.
Therefore, take into account that cheap mobiles will not reproduce for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, above, they constantly call to get still, for more safety, a loader for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when you write music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the USB universal connector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reading units can connect the small memory cards used on mobile phones.
In the players, with no exception (iPod), there is no need for any special software.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order only in the musical library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, gender, or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure similar to a Windows Searcher and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Crown, intelligent phones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific team, it is interested in the resistance of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and will listen to it every day only for a moment, as on the beach, then enough with any cell phone you play.
What practically gets really any mobile.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player reproduces the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, almost all of the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most extensive and with the exception of the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
Less include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough through the mobile Internet to visit the operator's competent pages (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could be just a weight argument for acquiring a mobile music.
Regrettably, operators' offer is miserable and most are limited only to the subject of the leaky success of the radio.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this particular way of selling music (whether through GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will in future dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends whether you always carry earphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile though it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already get a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic earphones.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic earphones, cost up to 15 thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really manage them by anyone.
The minimum functions, your handling similar to the previous current tapes or also the touch drives are obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that, by mistake, we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, the giant has low data.
Which device to decide by
Even cheaper mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card it will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, take a look at Crown, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (up to 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding lovers of music to have the hands of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line mobiles have almost identical use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most mentioned brand brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, here we still need something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna be long before he gets here.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed this by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming rates, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than sending them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is an extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, has already expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the virtual operator's entry into the mobile telephony market brought a marked decline in prices, at which the classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
However, there is no need to look for examples too far away.
In February of this year we informed you about the exterior of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
Only after half a year did this operator get over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta group is located which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic owns U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is possible to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they are sufficient with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this kind of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, often contrast with the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers at least half of the cost of SMS with respect to competition.
However, as shown by the example of Mobilking in Poland, it can also be a good blow to bet for a trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically addressed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if such a concept as Poland could fit into our country.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepík says: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively saturated"
There is no possibility in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say.
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
It's about Mobilking's launch in other countries in our region," said Jana Studniková, spokesperson for the Penta Financial Group.
He indirectly ensured that current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic definitely did not turn their backs on this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition emerges.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition for Phone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward at the meetings," said the group spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe they're wasting better times.
It seems that, for non-official information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field," said Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To this day we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table a specific contract that could be studied in as short a horizon as possible."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the own requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepiký adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this concerns the allocation of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider it precisely the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet in the mobile."
Offices responsible - with operators of sheep and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would increase competition which would lead to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
Then why facilitate entry to competition?
When operators want to get something, they're able to pull out of the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U:phone came up.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on ČTU was at the time of the entry of U:phone by the T-Mobile company.
It is witnessed by public information available on the ČTU website.
But right now U:phon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, it is not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile telephony market was opened to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be for him and, above all, for his large services."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, she expressed her typical attitude to this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the UOHS, added to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices which should represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that they should note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their market entry contributed to the lower prices of mobile telephony services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the lowering of prices is not within the interest of the UOHS.
Indeed, the dramatic shock in all this case lies in the dissatisfaction resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of petrol in the gas pipelines as it is clear that it is work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTU, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another view - to get a virtual operator out is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must be necessarily dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators appear attractively similar.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in the ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which UOHS washes hands in this whole matter.
We've already met with him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the extension of ČTU's competition in the field of commercial tenders was recently tabled, even when a number of experts promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of UOHS must know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine when nobody sees
At the same time, unconsciously it continues to work as well as a pseudo-virtual operator that in Czech mobile networks there are already a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile telephony services which, however, are only one part public.
This is usually about companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephony services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the company carrying a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those mentioned could be found to be infringing on the terms of the contract that could be translated at the end of the collaboration with the company concerned," answered Martina Kemrová to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that an activity of this kind carried out by mobile telephony operators would reach responsible people.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they achieve nothing despicable gains and, at the same time, - unlike the true virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows for speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a significant percentage of customers.
These should also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of operators."
This is exactly what the ČTU should think at least strange.
In addition, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephony operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why block the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and, if you do not want to, should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases have defended operators but their clients.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to emerge the first virtual operator and with it they started to appear more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all this happens as if it were a burning key.
For our experience, we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributes in these cases is good for them.
But we won't despair.
If this information between builders is correct and the virtual operator really reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is probably beginning to move again.
If any of the operators allows any virtual mobile telephone operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new official record of the hymn Where, my home, on the occasion of the Czech official celebrations.
The new hymn recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, another with Coro and another instrument.
Del canto is responsible for Katerina Kněžinková y Adam Platetka.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said before that he deliberately chose for the Singers Alone with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and later, also with the Coro, which will be fixed in the word so that the text is understood well, so that it has consonance," he said.
The Czech official hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my home sounded for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škrup.
He gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Prague MDD brings us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this time by nearly one hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time load it on their chip card in the info centres and stations of the transport company at the metro stations, Museum, Mostek, Nádraži Holesovice, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonuses can be bought from yesterday on the website of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget the ticket sales points in the metro stations, where so far they had to regularly queue to get a regular ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared staff that helps interested people with the purchase of the internet and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesperson Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on Opencard in the exhausting automatic machines that are located in some metro vestibules.
How are these exhausting machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticketing machine, and the passengers will probably have already been fixed in them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
Electronic bonuses from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on bypass trains and bus lines from 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the central Bohemian localities.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bonus zone," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which establishes the timetables for the collective transport of Prague.
Circuit buses have their reading cards mounted on the driver’s cap.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the bonuses there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on roundabout buses and do not remember when they finish the bonus validity can be directed to the exploding machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the computer screen, you will see information about the validity of your document.
The South East wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
The German Sudets requested in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the scientific library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some German groups from the Sudets were allegedly directed to the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters stored in a particular file that are stored today in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of the "Shumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want his word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as deliverers" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the destiny of Shumava in their hearts".
Given that the association of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans is presumed - according to them the Czech national character - to be a hope only in brutality, neglect, incomprehensibility, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president who assumes Shumava for today and forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that it fully cooperates with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumed to be the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the U.S. suspected doubt about this idea of the Germans, he would simply organize a referendum on whether his inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under his patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with our current knowledge of post-war history, can sound a bit childish, some experts say it is closely depicting the expectations of the Germans of the south-east of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least bet that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Swedes.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
Even Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
This was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, wrapped up in the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and placed him in the camp of prisoners of Holstein, dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Bene Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The minister's office, Aleš Răbíček, promises to deter drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
The driver should be deterred from high-speed and from alcohol to the steering wheel.
And also to remind them that before they start, the belts are attached.
He wants to get to the knowledge of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and ultimately also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embitter emotions.
And to that end, we've been witness to the "sacrifice" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "Do not think" is written with large letters on the record.
And in a blood tank is the word "pays."
This should symbolize that the man at a time of departure can pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Sonian lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
Promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and milk for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and milk system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and so saves time.
The latex is a threat to the fine or the accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says hospital psychologist Na Homolce, Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign is needed in the press and, above all, a negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all areas occupied for peace
The President of Israel's provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke of the return of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely, West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all lands (occupied) if not all," Olmert said in the newspaper.
"We shall certainly be left with a few percent of these lands, but we shall have to give the Palestinians one percent similar (of the land of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of a return, Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as he did to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several dead and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" located within the ancient city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won't work," he insisted later.
Removed from the Highs of the Golan
Olmert also spoke of the withdrawal of Israel from the High Gods of the Golan, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose closing peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to get rid of to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hizbula (the Chita movement), they must dissociate themselves from the permanent support of Hamas (the Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Are the bus rides illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long bus
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises as to whether azafats and passengers can be moved by the bus during the trip.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the soda is opposed to the road traffic law," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which he died last week was twenty-two years ago, obviously caused by the truck driver only when the bus crossed the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the safest place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the right time when the soda distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with standing places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have places to walk, as confirmed by the company's director Radim Janchura at Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is in progress if they have a seat," he said.
Azafata doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafata - no legal provision clarifys this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term 'Vehicle Auditor', whose rights and obligations are not defined', adds, less specifically, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks otherwise that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
"It depends whether the bus has the approval allowed to have standing places.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the towns, where there are places to be on foot and at maximum speed, interurban with places to be on foot with a greater speed permit and those from long distances without places to walk, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a seat belt.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's expert on transport safety, Jaroslav Horín, does not see any significant problems with the movement of azafat on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on aircraft.
You don't even have the certainty that the turbulence comes and that the soda can hit your head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops obviously that physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the ferry.
The security of the roof must be resolved by the internal rules of the transporter," he said, and he also believes that from the point of view of the law this issue is unresolved.
Janchura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter that offers the azafatas service.
He employs two hundred.
The Director, not even after the accident, considers this risky work.
"However, when I have the impression that the ashtray position is at risk, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can get it, passengers, when they get in.
I would even save costs," he says.
In the interest of safety, it is the reason Asiana lacks azafat in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have affluence, we've been against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago to Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Happened
In the accident of the line joining Naples, a young Pilsen fan who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking car blocking the bus pass without using the intermittents.
His driver tried to avoid it in a fast maneuver, however, he struck with the right front.
Janchura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the azafata were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to claim the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but will also wait for the financial costs of the guilty.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring more precision on the movement of the soda on the bus in which thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working for a year.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to the buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the journey," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the azafats to be a major threat to the safety of passengers," concluded spokesman Hanzelka, saying that security control on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Security Office at work.
Dusseldorf's hope is based in Frankfurt
In the letter from the Bank's West LB Board of Directors for its collaborators there are few words missing.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with DEKA bank can form a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group, as the writer says, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability capacity, would enter into such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That is how the text is understood when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like the West LB before it is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services recently made clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time, also on the part of Frankfurt, much has been said about the union of this type between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse’s customers know about their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after a year and a half at the end of August, said he saw no sense in the bank merger, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA's Board of Directors, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned a joint directive to start negotiations with West LB on joint commercial activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said in the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003, the situation at one point seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
Only plans were made public, Hesse's government expressed itself against Helab's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Board of Directors, said that he was opposed to the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different public law banks is necessary.
So when the elections of the Bavarian Parliament are to pass, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will miss the partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it has been much better than the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich property had done.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the North LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be decomposed, but that is, of course, not the bank's own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the Board of Directors of the Bank, it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole Bank
As the coexistence between individual parts of the bank can be combined with DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend of Italians"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena attended him as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, a barrel of 5 litres of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Octoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a palm tree, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the parking next to the train station Porta Nuova, tonight at 23:45 three buses, `Munich direction, the beer festival', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are intended mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the parking areas next to their flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leatherfork and glasses with silver-colored paddles, belongs to these buses.
Five years ago they came to Octoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
From night on the way over there, during the day on the prairie, at 22.30 p.m.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made under the Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and the German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the quiet reigns on the bus, the passengers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
They go to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration take another break on the bus 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has expected to arrive at 6.30 p.m. in the parking lot next to the Teresa Prado, there are already about 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "coscersivaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign shop are opened, that means marching!", Marco yells in the morning.
"Go!" Go and take the back seats in the campaign shop.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all with yellow hats don't sit on the same bench, all over the space!"
One litre of beer, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the propina
Show the security people that we have good tone!
Just get out of your place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to come here!" Have you understood?
And now they're all going to October party.
One, to mark the way, even the yellow hats in the trees, traffic signs and even in a cartel of the elections of a large Bavarian Popular Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Octoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who travel on the Alps and who storm into the campaigns, 10 per cent of all came especially this weekend of Italy.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria, which makes statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with over 200 medical assistance, face the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The best shop in the Italian campaign is called Hofbrăuzelt.
Nights without sleep for the creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, only Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed last week.
However, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking area would also be affected by critical trends.
And that's what happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's real estate finance, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to withstand market disturbances.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The share of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use must be of interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as public law banks.
The cause is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, the state finances with the money that was lent to long-term projects had only been financed for a short period of time - which is now no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of the year, the capital reserve of the bank in cash has fallen by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital also delayed slightly from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income of financial investments and net profits of financial transactions fell to zero, the income of the debtors and some securities also those of the disbursement of the provisions of credit business declined by more than 70 per cent, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high income of the reimbursement of the costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest under the federal tax code and the business organization for the consortium companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit of approximately 16 per cent more.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financial at first lost itself in speculation with industrial real estate credits, which served as a basis for the Aareal Bank.
Since it was not possible to make a lot of money with the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as state (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Real Estate Hypo has to make amortizations on the value of the branch that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of the group's losses and profits, it is said very precisely.
It is a fact that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they had already been cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became a significant state and financial asset in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, in comparison with other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans has fallen essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year, the Hypo Real Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a portion of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not capable of functioning"
Other sources say that, thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of the Hypo Real Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is guaranteed from now on.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the urgency of the crisis, there is no constant.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
I ran the voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary rescue can not at least calm the concerned.
The stock price dropped to 75 per cent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While the priority debt remains almost unchanged, the loan rates according to the position in the ownership register are clearly lower.
They are mainly affected by the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and for the sake of which the loans go beyond 2009.
Following the remarkable growth in the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, so far it can start from the depreciation of pensions within the deadline.
Or something's going to happen, which is not likely to happen to anyone -- the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But when we see the news cross on partial stabilization, now the security that is already within its limits has become a legitimate hope.
That will be a reason, because the creditors will spend the night without sleep, breaking their head over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use the transport to a new account of the losses for future payments of income tax compensation on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibano High School, the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she counts Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to college, I was afraid.
I live at the border of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go on a train for 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, lucky I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as strict as in my home in Baja Sajonia.
At eight in the morning students come, at nine or twenty begins a small meeting with teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
Moreover, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and in a week will be my birthday.
I was very happy at this moment because I had been studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have kissed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her about my Mangas.
That belongs to the Japanese girls' survival dictionary and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I slid fast in my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gang sounded, I felt really upset.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked many questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation everyone took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lancebox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, pepper salad and algae, fruit and something like meat in tofu.
In most cases, I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are weird and they have a new taste.
What's safe is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marine shells in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools the benefits are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a poem in a very artistic way for a boy and is given it in hopes of getting to know him better during a rest period.
I read about that in my Manga Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year's school.
Then I always said:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to understand comics and culture better, one day I started studying a bit of Japanese.
For me, it was absolutely certain that one day I was going to travel there.
Also because I have a flake for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a country of severe, disciplined and traditional nature.
As everything is well organized, I still haven't felt lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a neurology scientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they feel the same when they behave in the same way as we do?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else could prove it until now, although we can not even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, so some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contaminate our subjective animal experience.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex (due to their participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead to conduct).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than in other primates, and it seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primates.
Another particularity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is connected to the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though the consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created at all, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has special hardware, nor is it analysed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the experience, but there is also another aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated regardless of their content, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that followed Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing is to pass the neutral correlations of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the brain cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that the emotional system activates a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the brain cortex, which distinguishes the primates and above all the man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations continue because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to describe the states of others together with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the brain cortex responsible for the body feelings and the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Panksseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons, I can't go against that, but I don't think it's likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, perhaps that feels in two cases too: but how can you control whether rats and men behave similarly?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, can you be afraid?
I believe that the similarity of behaviour is not yet proof of the similarity of experience.
True, the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, the shells on the other hand do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to prove it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how he can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as it is measured equally by rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and the consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward rather than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
The President of UEFA Platinum: a period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, Deputy Prime Minister, said preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's confidence in its ability to organise Europe's championship with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin, and there is much to be done in both countries."
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is cool.
The number of stadiums is likely to be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work very quickly," said the president of a Ukrainian Grigorij Surkis association.
"UEFA won't take away our eyes."
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
After many scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is unable to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"In a letter we have assured the President of UEFA Platini that the preparation for the 2012 Europe Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many first division clubs were convicted of downgrading, and finally the division council had to be postponed.
Enraged Dennis Quaid Contract
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's angry and he's attacking.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan's ex-pair and Dennis Quaid: eight years after her divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after her divorce.
The reason why private things were revealed was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," said 54-year-old man to "New York Daily News".
Among other things, it is very "momentary" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is newly married and recently is a twin father.
And so ends with his statement, pointing out: "Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's okay."
Flight and hotel ticket prices are down
In the first half of 2008, flight tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's tickets.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Flight tickets and overnight stays at hotels were made cheap again - these are the results of a study by the provider of American Express travel services and financial services.
The company has analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter has seen a major change in the second half.
After many years of rising hotel prices in the market, overnight stays in many places have become cheap.
Compared with last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased by an average of 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 per cent compared last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that "the interests of American tourists in travelling decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, hotel prices increased to 26.3 per cent and thus made a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, flight ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene, the passengers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long distance flights were even more expensive up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of air tickets in the class Economy, compared to the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 per cent, but the changes in prices for the Business Class and the FirstClass were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 in the second half to 23.6 per cent.
According to one study, prices for national flights in Germany even decreased to half.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the increase in the fleet economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market by plane demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankrupt - 24 airlines were only in Europe.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:1
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still doesn't come out to do the demopressive goal.
Kristoff Klein presented very well the forced landing of the player of the Marko Martin national selection.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed with a goal.
Everything I meant by reacting exactly to what happened could be clearly read from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," says Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the stadium in Hamburg.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the guests were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who formed part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach sat down with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of consent.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the chief coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Go, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," Marcel Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard also wanted to have it "more relaxed".
Result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also the situation that Gladbach's team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday the Hamburg SV will meet its 121-year-old.
On Saturday the viewers had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the changing table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcel Jansen.
It provides that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the league's vigour than to the dominance of its HSV.
The quip with its players forced late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric and Jansen who were taken from FC Bayern need time to join, but the quip can still not shine with its success.
"We need more of the feeling and the dribbling," Jol demands.
After the loss of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the bank's bailout package dropped down to 700 points in the Down Jones period.
That was the loss of the biggest points during one day in their history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little bit.
At 20:30, one of the world's most important stock exchange barometers quoted a 5 per cent deficit in 10,579 units.
Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this moment, the biggest loser in the Dow Jones was American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank almost lost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The rescue plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called mortgages "poridas".
But the sum is going to be paid by hit but step by step.
As a compensation for this, the State must receive the option receipts of shares for financial partnerships that can be charged during the course development to reduce the financial burden of the State cash.
The course of action in Europe and the US continues to decline
The aid of billions to banks in Europe and the United States does not reassure investors.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and negatively affects Dax.
Despite the rescue of the state-designed financial market, the US Dow Jones index is still falling.
The losses of the speculative shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, Munich's property finance has lost two-thirds of its value for a period of time, the Commercial Bank has lost more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 per cent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets all over the world have suffered a fall.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with considerable losses.
Investors fear that the $700 billion bailout package from the U.S. government is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to remain at 10.809,25 points.
The United States House of Representatives wanted to vote on the draft rescue, the Senate vote could be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia the main Japanese index Nikkei after benefits fell to 1.26 per cent in 11,743.61 units.

Following the announcement of capital expansion, Arcandor's shares lost in MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the trade and tourism consortium announced that the shares in Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter influences the trajectories of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has led researchers to doubt: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relativity Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying around the universe.
Because fuel pipelines are now freezing to death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has led to confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a way of trajectories of space probes while they achieve acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, such as the Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
They are more frequent in terms of speed.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
The physicists couldn't explain this effect until now.
It was called anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the manoeuvre.
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of Albert Einstein's Relativity that describes the attraction force of matter by the bending of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, now believes solemnly as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during the gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in which the astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe know the existence of the Dark Matter for only ten years.
It is supposed to possess the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
Germans always fall back into the attention of kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE magazine tells about the most important cases.
In view of this, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is provided by the State Egyptian television, the broadcaster of Al-Arabia's Arabic television and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control your health status,' Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are safe, inform the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reason for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the guard said.
It was just "receiving the hostages" when it suddenly arrived "this surprise".
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the redemption of six million euros; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, kidnappers intend to release female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The Ambassador of Germany to Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Patriarch's abuse "carried to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by their ancestors led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquisitive study, knew that he had regularly attached his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had committed suicide in her house at Mutley's Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season that the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise moved back to Cornwall.
His window moved to Plymouth.
However, the court was aware that Mrs. Randle, who spent most of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had suffered twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "refused to life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terraza Randle, found the woman dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concluded by saying, "I used to pull her and throw her eyes away.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for his victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim by taking his own life.
Even more clear, it is that if she had not done so, the issue would probably not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I have noted the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
BBC was informed that an official of the Cabinet who forgot some secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the waterloo train.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is certainly the least serious burden under the law and does not imply any intention to commit a crime.
The BBC correspondent for the Frank Gardner Defense reported that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause referring to the protection of information.
The Real Legal Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee on Secret Services.
The missing documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than 80,000 pounds after the rescue/salvation of Bradford and Bingley.
In fact, the Government provided 14 billion pounds of sterling to protect deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savings.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the savings money, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that the companies and their members must pay.
Eventually, the 14-billion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages have been redeemed.
However, the interests that become in-house are assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with caution ... are called to pay today the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81,000 pounds of sterling to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that acted prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data that indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members in view of what could be a relevant price," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, this will be a full year of required interest, which can be almost twice as much.
As mutual-building companies and no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey road will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of milk products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two thoughts in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February was in 2002.
Freedom denied on bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail by chargeing him with 50 million takas ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various corruption charges against you.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of this month.
The return of Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the government of the country, supported by the military, grant him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while he was given conditional freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear what are the terms of his release or whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said they would appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad under parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her defenders argued that she needed her freedom with confidence to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her homeland after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, supported by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to benefit from a recent anti-polyomyelitis vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that children could not reach some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said that despite the pledges made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or impeded thousands of officials during the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Commission of Competence after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the ITV rival broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals that it will have to reduce its participation in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests impeded competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its package of actions in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ITV by BSkyB had doubts about the independence of ITV, and urged the Competence Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, noted that the obligation to reduce your package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, he would have surrendered his voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of American Lawyers
The Attorney General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of the officials of the administration.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Grand complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," said Attorney General Glenn Bellas in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But it was later assumed that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others, and many observers concluded that dismissals would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the prosecution of Republicans, members of the Congress' high profile, while others had refused to investigate complaints of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under the pressure of dismissals, gave up his position.
A number of other officials from the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Attorney General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and he stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the unemployed, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, Bush's former collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic of Honorary Child
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf won in 1977.
The Coldplay group is conducting nominations for this year's prizes and is categorizing the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell by Meat Loaf remained in the classifications for some nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for her heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Afterwards, he emerged as having a cyst in his vocal cords.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-term local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the North of the First Street – before I found the Second Street – between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This calculus, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty calculus more than an active route.
There's no sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on the First Street
who wants to renovate Extra Place and create a clean walk to shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-date neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncheon carriage simply because it was one of the last remains of the past of the block before the fitting of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has street control, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee on Land Use held this month, representatives of the Avalon Agency drew up a proposal to buy the street.
However, the Committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as the Community district manager Susan Stetzer said.3.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider Avalon's proposals to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some for use as coffee, waiting for renting the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned street and the possibility of converting it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee on Conservation, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was the development of property rather than its management.
Compared to its most colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The rear door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, is opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that comes up on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"I was full of trash, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the siege of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest ones, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a king of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinctt"), has made available a talk about the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow and out-of-the-way street, also dark for the day and marked by doors of oxidized and counter-window iron storage, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat would take care of the back of the street and stand near the door used to enter the CBGB and now host a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22° were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested they could get a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid and dark places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, "bilingual transition education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers teaching in languages other than English in class, is effective in eliminating distance in the final results.
For example, we take Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of the Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematical review
and almost one equally amazing 93 per cent has dominated the English language test and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient than that of Mr Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant assessment of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of apology.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of the Sixth Street, the school's approach to English education for students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We've had extraordinary success with students like this one who came from Mexico and that if you came into class 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their own constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama's prediction of the response.
While it is true that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by allowing people to stop worrying about the legislation that is written only in English.
Instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was dramatically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American ransom plan for financial markets might not be able to reactivate the economy.
The crude oil shares decreased by 7 per cent, reaching $99.80 per barrel in the morning ' s negotiations in New York Merchantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before returning, once again, due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety was taken over by investors, once again on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the ransom plan, the biggest in history.
The news was clouded by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of the Watchvia Corporation, as the government said this Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frenzy weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem to have not been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, a decline in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
"The prospects for global equity, interest and exchange rates will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products cannot escape this infection.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread worldwide and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, such as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction by 20 per cent by 2009.
Second locator room: team set record
After having passed, during the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
So he saw things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets turned a non-notation party into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played in the shadows of the clouds.
At this point, the Brett Favre quarterback found Laveranus Coles achieving a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect presage for one afternoon, in which the relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one when one cornererback fell and the other arrived in the middle with 10 seconds.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre from all the steps that went to Cole.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, no matter what people may think."
While Favre and Cole were in custody, Cardinals' defense was mistreating Kurt Warner's quarterback.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last tournament, the flaws imposed by Bowens might have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the bigger points that the Jets never made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he was answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third room - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Retired Gebrselasia heads its world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider her the greatest runner in history, surpassing her own world record in Berlin's marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to race 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After victory in the comfortable race in wool at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established world record number 26 in an impressive length career so he has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the counter-clockwise race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using average cuttings of 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that she had suffered calamity in the pantorrilla two weeks before and that she had lost a week of training.
Clearly, the suspension left him fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
The athlete has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Oriental rival - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the marches as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassie's skills as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after her marks decreased.
But just before three miles from the target, Gebrselassie took a last boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and establish her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation career, leaving a quarter of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to take a head and then recover them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and trials of the life of color
Hidden from the expansion of the park on the theme of the Great Orlando, just a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet town, where pride and the complications of African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city fully inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and the place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the year Zora! Eatonville Fair to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by its inclusion in Florida's travel guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, worthy and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going to be lost."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many remain cautious in front of the foreigners.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of the whole life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the claim of black people and a community of almost 2,400 people living below a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black South - sometimes neglected, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It's no wonder that those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as nobody here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten into the history of black people and the human drama.
With the face of cement both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, care for Howard Miller, as he can only read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sales drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts into relation Eatonville with the autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
"People are always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin continues.
But she adds, balancing in her chair in a backyard overlooking the Sabelia Lake, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most people in the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think his contribution to the world or his heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapping in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The officials of the Orange County wanted to put a five-carrail road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-carlet street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, inter alia, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred for the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went through the city pulling oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car sandwich."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston wrote the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents say today that school deregregation, positive in some respects, has weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the trust of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - it was used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because she was white - there's a cultural flaw there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boycott, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, a famous biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing her into American cannons.
The road project came just when Eatonville's most famous daughter went under the reflectors again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community started planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the opening event two years later, and every January, many return to celebrate.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The new idea of the five-way road would have been to put what you would call bending speed, a real civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd just said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a renovated and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, you may sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come to search for the history of Eatonville, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit is required in advance to do most of the interviews, and some things - like the walls in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of Christmas pride has also emerged.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, dumb and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the 18-year-old nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if they dare go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at your history, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee-keeping offices above their heads, bankers and fund managers who monopolies New York face the worst "bad day of the office" every day since 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the chairs and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, as well as human mules, with 50 eccentric stamping shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their food to take in the morning, and it is still impossible to pick up a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees are still waiting for their luggage to be put in the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic predictions that exist, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although it had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm of the end of the afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer's service bank, where life-long customers order their check-ins, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "personal banker of trust", and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them off, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), from credit unions and from savings boxes in their hometown, whose whites only work within the state of ownership, and who say to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, went bankrupt, and as the New Yorkers headed toward their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the ransoms on Wall Street.
Officials in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed executive director, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, 50 and something in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my purchases to the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in funds from the monetary market.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Pronounced Muslim graves when Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, participates in a demonstration to present the organization "Citizens Against Islamization" in Amberes on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent the mosques with a red line that crosses.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties on the right-wing extreme made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in which the police believe it was an organized action.
Offenders forged Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think this may have happened because they try to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the defamation, which reached Muslim religious people when the month of Ramadan was over.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that reached almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Party of Liberty and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration violence and some of its slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the vote, campaigned against the headsets and burkas, and also expressed opposition to the foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties seek to prohibit the construction of mosques and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have forbidden Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of earlier Glitter ' s convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Judge of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judicial Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Judge of the Magistrates of Ashford in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad, such as France and Spain, until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad because he was under the registration of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to communicate to the police the expected date with seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent's police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or possible stop point of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: "Kent police will do all they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the residents of Kent is the main concern of Kent's police and we work in close cooperation to monitor the behavior of sexual offenders registered in the county and to minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through the passport control and he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably reached Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Court of Justice, west London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for having images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, calmed down and rejoiced to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"Capto to the teacher out of the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No tacons, no steering wheel, no outer clothing.
The essence of the great Flamenco teachers, deprived of concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman.
The artist's side.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimate, at such times outside the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of a hand, neglected because they are not going to come out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theater of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of the Flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Flamenca Month of Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, most of every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flemenco-people" "can be people any but, when viewing the pictures, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These portrait people "on the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... captive to the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures from the scene.
Take your personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big ones of the Flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey in 1.997 to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, giving it modernity, which reflects how Bauer himself understands the Flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the dance, song or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who captures with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the idea that it becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant work of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment in their lives, whether long or short.
I think within the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don't even know, or who just leave you a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco carried by the title "Flamenco-people" is shown at the Gallery El Fotomata, located on the number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a fear"
It is located in places that he does not yet know and spends on unknown matters, but still Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to moving forward the new project he is working on, a novel that he has as a protagonist to Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite Nobel Prize of Literature confessed yesterday in its passage by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that concerns you today "is a fear" and that "everything indicates that you shouldn't write" the novel.
"If it were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he's seen passing through the city of Acueducto to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was one of the highlights of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the "There Festival" award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the audience of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a public handed down to him the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how he was born in him of his literary vocation, derived from the "extredinary adventure" of "like to read" and "live more than what he lived"; how he writes of "disciplined manner" to provide his "inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and reversing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are supported.
The Spanish novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "make people more inconsistent", so he asked the writers "not to give up on cowardice" and "take responsibility" his vocation.
Climateology takes care of the Pozoblanco fair that also remains unrestricted
The district party that closed the subscription to the Pozoblanco fair was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced reunioners that the square floor was not in the best condition.
Thus, according to Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the company decided to suspend the competition.
Meteorological highlightes have faded with this fair, since at last two of its three parties could not be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the second expected bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a closure of Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a party.
In him, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That very evening, Alejandro Talavante came out with two toasts and one ear, which gave the tendons more than his tore.
That's right, even worse was The July, which passed through the Los Llanos thing without suffering or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief pheasant was won the bronchon of a large part of the public.

The agents prosecuted them and detained one of the two inmates, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., as reported in a communication to the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public document.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in the N-1, in their passage through the town term of Arminón.
They were willing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, hurriedly and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle was stopped a couple of miles later in the arcene, when their two occupants appeared to flee the race for a forested area.
The Ertzaines finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachis they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they moved to police units for a thorough inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, the officials verified that the registration had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrester had also been charged with an offence of falsification of the public document.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation into the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as stated, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant due diligence and will be available to the court within the next few hours.
Stop Heather Locklear from driving under the effects of any medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers when trying to get out of her parking in Montecito, as people have revealed a spokesperson for the California road patrol.
The witness has stated that over 16.30 hours, Locklear "was treading down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car from the parking front and back, and walking back passed several times over his sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first seemed not to recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol surplus was discarded from the first time, although "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medicine".
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of any substance that had not been specified and entered the local prison over 7 p.m. although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
You call on the Andalusian federation of UI to take over its competences in the Silva case
The U.S. General Coordinator and United Left Member Gaspar Llamazares today assured that it would be the regional federation of training that should take a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting family favors.
"I am a very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," Callazares said about the action that the party must adopt with which it has so far advised in the Sevilla Consistency.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for "transparency" is present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have done: "IU has always defended that these kinds of matters have the highest degree of transparency".
In the same line, he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public officials".
'May Blood', Garci's epic bet
In inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci rescinds the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangres in May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros in budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide list of interpreters.
May's blood, with a metre above two and a half hours, is drained this Friday into the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures us that he has fulfilled this "childhood dream", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to rotate a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, which he accepted whenever and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets which the Community of Madrid has made in its entirety constitute for Garci a "single opportunity" to environment with the decorations and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "an Atlantic Spain that was wrong as a leader to fight, because the struggle for independence led to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker laments that he has not had any funding such as that of Alatrist or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of the Mayan Blood, so he has not been able to round some scenes plasamed in a script signed next to Horacio Valcárcel, with which he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the Director of Back to Start has fallen into what is his usual form of work, the stage with the actors, with whom he usually tries before starting the round and those who don't cast, because he seems to be "humiliating" and considers that "part of the director's office is to go to the theater and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he meets in the May Blood repeat to his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranága or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions – one of which he won – Garcia believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind giraffes, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "that is what must be known," he said.
Garci doesn't expect prizes with this movie.
"At first you think you work for the poster, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you agree to make another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional travel.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevilla Dancerina Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will also honor a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and mother and mother (Georgia Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He had an exciting life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corse that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the midst of wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and it seemed amazing to me."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to count his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," she says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one in his performances, just as he did in that of "The Open Door"; and with the Master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes of Tortola the major, the character of maturity.
I am happy because I have accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pajaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which makes the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divine in all their extension, and are always in love with them".
The work also includes in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think it's those women who have a huge influence on a particular time and now no one knows and much less value their work," Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 20.30 o'clock at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" also closes the Trienio
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reincada" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez contracted marriage to Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Andalusian Board of Culture Council to celebrate the "Trinion Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize of Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Zenobia and Juan Ramón Trienio" comes to its end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This drop of light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through different Andalusian provinces, will be scheduled to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Andalusian Board of Culture Council has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Renewed Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malicia", and gives the idea of the disappearance of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the impressive idea that Newman has gone.
Look, it cost them an Oscar.
And it was withdrawn since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
It's still been a massage for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without virtue the men and very few beings you admire remain, it doesn't take Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was incarnated for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation to combat drugs created in honor of his firstborn dead by overdoses to his brand of home and organic food.
All a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood's admiration neighborhood without paying attention to nationality and passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that he had not killed a man but an age.
Another Englishman, poorly charged director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more than the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us a very high profile," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping high the requirement of probability and having a serious and private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful when he was probably left with no chance of being.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger out of the house, if I have yarn in it?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he sees the pride that his daughters in the earth coincide with their fans, something so unusual in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, none was as proud as of a devoted husband, loving father, solithic grandfather and devoted philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there are Olympics in Madrid and, after the 2012 crash, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's career, I say no!
The perfect career was called, and in my opinion it has been the worst career I've ever been in.
A pile of misunderstandings that would, from time to time, have been taken into account as an assessment and I would have examined, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go from start to end.
Disposals begin with the collection of the backbone, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn't sound bad to me, but if you're already getting it all out (including the chip to avoid loops in the race).
So no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the backrest (first unprohibited, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second unprohibited, because I need an XL size)
What kind of world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a little bit compared to those in the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the bag.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was expected, the race started and we had not yet left the bag, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain lessened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was combined with popular rebellion connotations and assaults on the tape.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my exit correctly.
From then on, if I was asked about the perfect career, this would not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Receptionist (virtual)
At the conference of Emerging Technologies of Microsoft MIT has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move around the company campus) by listening to the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the discussion groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be there soon.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example, in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been spoken much over a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the necessary rather than commercial trash loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
All a find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome left the network, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for hardware and software to be understood.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but you have to think about the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox or the Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come on the system used for?
It's less.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and is finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft employees' rest rooms in Redmond, early in the month.
In the fridge a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by shooting in 2010.
In Microsoft you will certainly look for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computers every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to be billing.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lit one in Edward Zwick's 'blood diamond', the same as Al Pacino in 'El Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that pungent bigotry force that lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it's nothing more than the typical men's underwear shirt in cotton, ash and no manganese.
The 'tank', which call the speaking angles, but the Fabuleus Marcel de Bruxelles ranks over all the others.
First of all, because of its rebuffing name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sports because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loves the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, back boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, marine shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Takes thought for the comfort underwear.
Even though it's a shame to leave them as inner clothes.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't care"
His huge appearance with his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is often but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that the company Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Healing and shy, win in the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that we have invented my sister Penélope and me for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both love the movie from the 1950s and 1960s; from there we draw many references.
Then I really like to miss a city and watch women dress up, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything unites and has many links in common.
I liked my clothes as a child; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to urinate in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers like to do our class and test stylism very much, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the dress is when you really find the character.
So everything goes together, that's right, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You've done a few days ago, have you ever been in a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with less mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think of being a mother or not?
From then on, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body asks me for it and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son great happiness and educate him with love.
As for the movie, you're hanging out with a couple of stars that you've circled around last year.
That's right, and I already wish they could see the light.
I, who am a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I want everything for now and of course, cannot be.
I'd like them to stretch out 'Last hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like.
A few days ago you debuted on a passageway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up to a gateway to make a model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a beneficial show for her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show - I took two pieces from our collection to Mango - was reluctant to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things about her are said that, I know her, I would tell you that many aren't true.
Besides, I'm staying so good with that part she's involved in.
He asked me to show up for such a noble cause, but if I could ask him to do the pin, so too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, what is needed.
Alcoholic drivers must install the 'alcoholic'
The interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, he has to install on his vehicle a system that prevents him from getting drunk, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney-General, according to which it is a pilot project with a duration of one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so that the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicle (FITSA) will participate.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once driving drunks take the car back.
The alcohol would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the spirited air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow up; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would run on behalf of the sanctions officer.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce offences to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviours before they arise in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and however, the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform of an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
It is precisely tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the time scheduled for the programme was scheduled to land at the Presidential Hangar at the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF the Spanish Air Force plane on which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
On foot of stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge that hour... she's from here or so...
- No, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport attached to the red carpet and a military valley made up of 27 Marine soldiers who interpret the rescue of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the Princess, wind melanin, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told her that in the DF he was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a scissor to the photographers before going to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the hotel door where they are staying, one of the four majors of the city, there is a reporter waiting for you from the Mexican television station.
The best-equipped fashion award
There may be no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there may not be a more exquisite and good-lived live live live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new fashion talents.
It has a 300,000-euro prize.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's escape at number 54 of the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept for the emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, made us finish at a luxury dinner in the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, shines even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart pounded with grief and making her brother's heart tripled, put on a suit of the House and a few ELAH addresses, which cut the breath, and the arm of her son Luis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner of honor.
Andik, the owner and master of Mango, did the honors and he's such a gentleman that he ended up, next to Rotchil's bar, without a jacket, because both of them had been lent to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the shop with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she turned herself into a long black sexy dress, excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, taught us the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, stuck to one of the bars and made a hiding of 'big pile'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace's dependencies, but before he showed us pictures of his son's mobile phone.
The following morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves on the bike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his shoes, towels and having previously requested that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And if it were small, they're all gathered in a book that will bring the relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The Awakener almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine wrapped up in the troubled rhythm that imposes the present life.
The office is called tension and the back pain computer.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the working world.
No, the number goes up, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or ‘spa’ treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book an entire ‘menu’ of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers it impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' disproves such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and concentrate on reading.
Speaking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited telling us something that happened the previous day, but to children who speak being asleep.
The first time that happens to the best you've had a shame, but it really doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of the dream that is called sleepyloquies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them told him he spoke the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They often relate to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (dwelling on floor) or sleepwalking, but you don't have to be like that.
As we have mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fever levels, stress situations or excessive excitement.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a study.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that you speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or all the contrary (screaming, screaming, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is very intense, the child should be observed and consulted with a specialist, to check whether there is any matter that is causing much anxiety and gives rise to it in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another alteration in the dream that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to bed.
So find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are fearsome or a bit violent.
With children very nervous and costing them a lot of relaxation, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the dreams appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing about what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's unconscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You won't get anything, because when you're asleep, you're not aware of how to organize your thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say, with which you are very careful about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
You never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeuern at last!
The football club, Islhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having done a good match, the team created many times of goal and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting where the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rove the squad with a shot away, Islhaeusern quaasi was going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of his foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Denmark.
In front, we didn't let the middle camper pass and we only left Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two times of Riahi and Temporal goal for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illousiens goggler can't enjoy his happiness for a long time and he'll be forced to go back to the closet a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illusians who have retreated a bit to "press" their defense, except in the last few seconds of the game during which, after an important lighthouse, the balloon passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a round of Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several British and Norwegian ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère last Tuesday morning to find their representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and expect him " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " set up by British fishermen to achieve measures against rising gas prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elíiseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to be competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors " .
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused jams of almost 10 km.
The sport port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors had already shown their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the Brest, and Lorient's fuel deposits, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Mancha coast, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the buses remained at the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the block of the important Donges Total refinery.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting, which will take place in the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " fishermen have not abandoned " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on petrol, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil at a price of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and a destiny " has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also hailed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian airline has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed Embraer's president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market in particular for the sale of aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would like to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group, which has been obtained from US monetary authorities, aims to sell more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, which is specified in this journal.
The AIG Management Board met last Sunday afternoon to consider any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to be separated include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer and its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, prosecute the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly conduct liquidity to repay its loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at risk of the American authorities taking 80 % of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion of the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss ever seen in the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, or the day when exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, to a technological dominant, decreased to 1.983.73 points and the expanded (extended) index Standard & Poor's 500 to 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have been able to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the media they requested to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
" This is not a good signal sent to the market, which the Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piezza, of the FTN Financial.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," said Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive "too late."
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the lead (the U.S. central bank, the Network N.) in managing the crisis, which would make credit conditions more difficult," warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance of the Global Insight.
And with more emphasis on the sense of urgency, " every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piezza stressed.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, triggering emergency interventions in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the United States but a global crisis", the analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The return on the 10-year-old treasure bonus decreased by 3,632 %, against 3,827 % on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year-old bonus by 4,161 %, against 4,357 % on the evening.
Obama, winner during the first television duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House took place to find out who triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Surprisingly, the republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory on this television duo that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to slow down in the polls at five weeks of the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives five points of advantage for Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who came out well.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm its advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of its member of its own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with its rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts," however Bill Clinton said this weekend.
Seventeenth General McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first issue.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
" I do not think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday on Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without arguing, he proved himself to be concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he said, this weekend, a democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
" During the ninety-nine minutes of discussion, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable person to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipitation.
" Next week could be a decisive episode," I loved, yesterday, the influential and democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama ' s " good economic instincts " with that of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that despite the fact that the US tax would be reduced by 95 per cent in spite of Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of any energy independence in the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a 45 nuclear power plant park from here by 2030.
Wisely, both candidates ignored the issues related to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted by the Congress last afternoon and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents protested last Sunday afternoon at the main square of the Belarusian capital to anticipate rejecting the results of the legislators.
Hundreds of Belarus gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closing of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: " the dictator must resign " .
Some admit that they have not voted: " why, because they will do what they want with my vote," says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has put foreign observers in a good position in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean for observers.
They weren't in the opposition.
" We have been placed beside the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroup of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change, notes Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition come into Parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But your entry to Parliament can mean television shows, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore get into the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) favoured manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to Parliament, who are better suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again to the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased to see their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the world's safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And above all, he regained public confidence that he had been seriously paralyzed by the scandal of the blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, in February 1994, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer occur.
While Judge Krever was delaying his relationship, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all the other provinces and territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, nearly 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," he said, proudly saying that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebec population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary nevertheless recalled that " trust is extremely fragile " .
Since its creation, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle on 28 September 1998.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can arise from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of persons who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the tests of nucleic acid that enable donors to directly detect the presence of the virus in the blood rather than antibodies against the virus, in which the tests used so far were based.
Nuclear acid tests allowed to cut the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period within a period of less than a week.
We have thus substantially reduced the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, every 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, more than 24 years will pass before a case of transmission of HIV through a blood product occurs.
I think today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover your health without any concern," says Hema-Québec head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion that, for example, the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
She has to be constantly vigilant," said Dr. Décary before stressing that, in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" The needs increase because the population is ageing.
Since anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to inject red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the network of blood donors, which in the medium term regroups only 3 per cent of Quebecis eligible for blood donation. "
However, all persons with good health, aged 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In the medium term, 14% of those who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we have managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poor people are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since the present life is very slow, we rarely find time to spend an hour to donate their blood," says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone ingestion, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the introduction of our thousandth blood sample from the umbilical cord and is expected to extract more than a thousand of these per year.
We should start to propose it for ingestion at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this blood take program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this, " since Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on Semifinals
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) on the coast of the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the series of final rooms, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central camper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal on either side, the middle camper David Text and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who spent Matt Jordan on the Sounders.
We remember that during the first party of the series of parties going and going, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a defeat for 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, Thunder lost 3-1 in the return party to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps reached the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should face Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – The winning goal of Kovalev
The third number one of Canadians is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn, composed of the team, encouraged the attack on a 3-2 Canadian free-shooting barrier against the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this profit, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, before the Russian.
"I need another party to feel comfortable."
He tried to play as fast as he could at first, notes Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the party.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party concludes, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to make himself elected during the partial election today.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while staying on the main lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
In three huge screens, they showed spectacular images of hydroelectric embalming, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his time was very full.
The " North Plan " is the fourth side of a " vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a " new economic space " which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister was limited to explaining why the North was " a gem to enormous potential " but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could, above all, be more developed is, in particular, hydroelectricity, forest, but above all the mining sector, affected by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, five, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " according to Mr. Charest ' s enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France " is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the stream towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, stated the prime minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments have repeated.
There is a border line in which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion comes, I repeat that position of the government," he said.
In addition, " with climate change, we need to reconsider our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will be opened each year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would pay great attention to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former member of the Quebec Party of Ungava), have already started consultations with nearly thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting where " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan " will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly " , he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuing with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded him.
" Like the previous Liberals, we have thought otherwise to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the re-appointment of the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"By Godbout, who created HydroQueebec, in Lesage, who made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party was supposed to forge the future," Juan Charest said.
At the press conference, he called for another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Speaking on the subject of the project of Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric embalming, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment was scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I expect to be there," he entrusted his militants, bringing applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of holding a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his timetable was, however, full, particularly because of a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problem accepting: the Liberal Party of Quebec demands in particular the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec Party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Québec North Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, abandoned to apply it.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec's Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Government's Northern Plan.
"But what you want is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastian Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacations today.
Letras - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (Oh irony!) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "glory" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who has taken an incessant fight for justice and deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated his national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts he was charged with occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhumane conditions.
The only person who has a false justice to assess the guiltyness of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't matter if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exacerbations.
We still do not realize that, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word Harper continues to repeat and that doesn't make sense.
The time has come when no morals exist any more: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far as he wants to be a minority (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what our country's reputation and dignity was doing.
Mr. Toews' shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest arifera company attempted a six million euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
According to Barrick Gold, why would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to maintain a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the dispute is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defenses and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost out of the mine.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, often consist of ruining the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will soften the opposition in addition to fearing anyone who will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by beatings.
It was enough, therefore, for the mine to open its books, files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects requests and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he could ask for a "public" debate, disregarding his views?
According to the Vice-President, this word appears to refer only to very paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; it represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing this because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not within what many people perceive as a persecution-moordage (following the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just filed a claim with the authors of Noir Canada encouraging them to stop using this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to have a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease this world’s wealthy companies in a country like Canada, under much persecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's relentless persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to place devices that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan that aims to halt the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months still needs to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the invested public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses covered by the lack of payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the assisted companies.
The American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
" We have made great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the ordinary economy and Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis," the democrat explained.
" This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances about the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they were afraid of the effect that would lead to a new failure in investor humour.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting, however, to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this end.
Senator Barack Obama provided him with certain provisions to reach the agreement, in particular which would enable the owners to preserve their home and the wage of the leaders of the state-surviving companies.
" When contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned in another chain as to whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that " I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for them. "
" The important points I read [show] that it is something we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said that the option to do nothing is not acceptable."
The 700 billion-dollar plan aims to buy with the taxpayer's money the suspicious debts, the assets at risk and the indemnibles of the US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the collapse of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage credit risks before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a divestment of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican electors who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have been out of custody since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With a view to limiting expectations for everyone at Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which 100 other billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get participation in the assisted companies that will pay you dividends in the event of profits and that will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on the metallic compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, stated to his voters that " with all the evidence Washington does not want to understand ".
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of benefiting from contributors."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an encouragement to a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the route to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for $11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas informed that he had refused to buy his bankruptcy competitor since he lost $2 billion ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that the savers and the families now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley and over €41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes thus represented his triumph.
Did the American actor with a charming smile ever get rid of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
Their smell, their sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the register of power that the true holy monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, because of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American movies over the years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he seemed a lot and who was long considered a rival in the cinema, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the collapse of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No unbiased ego, last quality mark.
Because in him was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the war of the Pacific, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television and soon at the cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked in second place at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star also disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the filmmakers to be the target this weekend, while his great roles were intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual shift parade through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the cowboy with the charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Cata on the zinc roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we call upon your sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of the cinema.
This Rocky Grazian, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer at Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangrove in the sussuous film The Sting (El Goppe), Oscar at the best film in 1973.
Black billar player and vindictor in Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), will repeat the character at Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 was awarded his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This guy that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
The eras change during their career.
Young people especially know him thanks to Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on little orthodox ice.
His fans returned to see him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as patron of the Irish mafia at the Sam Mendes Road to Perdition in 2003, the rice was raised.
Unlike several movie legends that soon left the race, Newman remained a lot in the world of the movie, reporting Hollywood, his gold, his fasts and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge living in " the underplaying " and judging its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, he often interpreted the role of young gallon less than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, goats or desperate, whose features reflected rebellions.
As a performer, Newman revealed side by side his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward on the main role, described a female melancholy portrait.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his movie Harry and Son in 1984, a work of smell and sadness.
" Among the many honours that were set up yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, deeply saddened: " My life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestant against the excesses of Hollywood is also hidden.
We've seen a lot of his face reigning over wine-growers, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a bad taste method, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than being content with his myth, he will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In summary, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
It accuses politicians and their partners of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes to justify on many occasions the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and the councils - in total some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the Fiatal Balladal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the recovery of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices, from which there was no real execution, the various associations had never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To this end, the Talonaries were obtained in the Józsefváros District market and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the falsified invoice should be made was decided among others in that tour by the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent to István Sides.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he should choose hotels and restaurants.
She asked for invoices for her consumption and they served as a model for making invoices that were presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the Capital Board.
These invoices were signed in most of them by István Sides and his associate András Khartoumri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his colleagues, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit together in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövârt Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel in Badacsonytomaj town had only three rooms and more than ten people couldn't stay there in one night, but the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of big fantasy invoices also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomic center. Because in the book-holder of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövōért and Hoppá.
The manager of the company, Gy.z. Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and showed him the invoices, he knew that they were false documents.
"On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that a hundred people were accommodated in the bill, since there are only eleven rooms in which there are not so many people.
In addition, food was included in the invoice, while the restaurant had not worked for a long time.
Enthusiast invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organizes exclusively travel abroad, so that in the cash invoice they pointed out as service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the agency's billing practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, although travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövöert Foundation, since the services of the company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel employees only extended invoices made to the machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" also made other errors, such as in the case of a company where they put in the invoice as an activity carried out by road transport, to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - the company does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp is known to be false invoices sent to Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, to XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and to Biztos Pont.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to send these invoices.
The falsifiers also failed to note that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation process, so the liquidation process manager - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
The invoices were issued by conscience
Another group of false invoice manufacturers were made up of those who were aware that they should send fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták, sent invoices worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évesredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - According to the accusation - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, convinced him to send fictitious invoices.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his associates the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices worth about five million HUF to the Jobb Jövört Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny Association Egyesület, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to include them in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictional headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuel and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth about 18 million HUF in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer resources.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he sent invoices on behalf of the company for Atlas, Hoppa and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány by charging the amount itself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian Albanians at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies did work properly - according to the accused - to whom they did not receive employment.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his associate, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for Atlas and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor considered Kubatov to have received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of the company in charge of Szi-Beri to send fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 000 HUF from the competition respectively, but did not use the money for the purpose of the competition.
To prevent this from being discovered, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemexei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting may be the confession of the chief accused János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
Because his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to speak of everything, he has not done so until now.
The question is: what interest does it have?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zusi will assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, could have been offended for these days, since in order to relieve his prison conditions, he requested a house arrest, but he was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous authors of very high-value economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least wait in their own home, he has no chance of that.
Psychology of the answers: Why do we spend more money?
The participants in the auctions are willing to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological bases - economics of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in skills such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists have tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in a auction and as long as it was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is a fundamental element to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located below the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-prime" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention to avoid an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups betting against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and its members were betting.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more in prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of the loss of the auction, even the members of the group lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group that played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deducted from any previously existing economic theory.
Because those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods have helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schutter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms appear to be very common; they are characteristic of liver infection and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis virus depending on the pathogen is spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humour (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is recommended for travellers to be protected by a vaccine against virus A and B, and against C no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, it is manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appears in the skin and in the white of the eyes the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Each year a million people die in the world of cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people do not know that it is sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
Since this disease can also be detected with routine laboratory control, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the body, so you can eliminate the infection and prevent cancer.
On 30 September, it was the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to a recent study, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the context of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting by the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of studies in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis took place in the following way; they fixed a chispanzee instrument at the patient's left hand, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at it in two paintings; the 17th-century work of the Virgin Mary and the Lady of the 15th-century Armor of Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the performance of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while choosing Leonardo oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a calming effect.
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while observing the painting of the religious theme or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people "they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts".
When they observed the picture of the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impactive image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality" - added Wright.
After these amazing results, there remains one question: What effect would the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size have on the regulation of pain?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary cast even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In his tenth birthday Google can say: you can find it both in the people's pocket, and in the sky above his head; you know where their vacations went, what doctors visit, and what they care about.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as many personal data as possible on its users, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "we gather in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that it turned on the world is still at the beginning stage of its efforts to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen within five years Schmidt answered: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would the job be best for me?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple while there is not enough information for users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their navigation on the Network, the keyword search, IP addresses and pages are carefully stored when the search is finished.
For example, thanks to Customized Search that started two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-examine what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic the Recommendations will be based, on which the system will offer us products and services based on previously defined and stored preferences.
What if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearsome and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that not only do they retain, but in justified cases they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google provided the Brazilian government with the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who are concerned about the rights of persons were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated to the court that he was right in his dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has reached its pretext to strengthen the Child Protection Act adopted years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory in Google's view: those who fear to provide their personal data criticize it because they think it harms their privacy, their privacy when they start using Google's services, and rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as the world's conqueror, for much that both struggle for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the software package is constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborating than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that has just been produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, to leave targeted trails behind us and take advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures vary individually, the essence remains the same: show us ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even combine them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their music habits, then they can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, where the latest photo galleries that are stored automatically appear on Flickr or in Picasa.
We can learn many cases of those who find out that, for example, the bride, when she sees the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, she finds out who happened to her cheating boyfriend last night or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his honest opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows herself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least try to ignore Google's monopoly, can do it (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but doesn't leave any traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid finding them, but you can replace Google's "on-line" applications, from text editing software to image and read news applications with alternative versions that don't connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion almost expects to open the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($14 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced increasingly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the senior management roundly rejected the employee's protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare facility, considered too much of the unlimited number of employees' food, but this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google submitted to pressure from the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, filtered all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it was already ready to work, which is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to revolutionize the world: while some believe that the Google's book and magazine project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of its health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogel, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which only a man of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to wipe the tracks of the author of the double murder of the city of Ozd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd who, according to a well-founded suspicion, helped to wipe out the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Commissioner General of Public Order of the province of Borsod.
Young people recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently charged with crimes.
The two minors - according to the information provided by the Hungarian News Agency - are two girls - are free to defend themselves.
Because of the complexity you can get up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive custody since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The accused didn't want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed the victim's daughter.
According to ITI, the young man was prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden in the crime scene.
The police are analysing with an expert on the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - per cent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, although the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which within a few months wishes to sell 60 per cent of the shares.
The Czech Economic Journal E15 reported that the Polish offer was the highest among those offered by interested parties in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not dismiss the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a participation of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments devoted to the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - La República de Roma - the President has not even been able to obtain the support of his own party for the draft law made urgently, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which was spoken of by multi-millionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is better to speak of a "second 11 September".
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of El World, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that led to the world economy on the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the US monetary system is growing, and then this will affect the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote, the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You cannot ignore this threat - points out the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw a life belt at the thumping financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if more banks are demolished, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis only received more than EUR 100 billion on Monday - he recalls the Der Standard Vienna, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans have done, European taxpayers must also pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far taken seriously the crisis that is taking place as a pretext for the Old Continent .
The "saviours" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a major harm?
The Smart Car Imitates the Flight of Affliction
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, that of the poor.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the aberrations gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of BR23C-like cars of nature, to which the characteristics of the misfortunes were given, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that could escape all collisions.
During the flight, each accident creates its own particular oval space that actually looks very much like our security protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of the bees that are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the length measurement system for laser beams.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that is immediately transformed into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds, the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the movements of the misfortunes, changing the direction turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any system currently existing, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react with enough speed as to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, within which any kind of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what makes a disadvantage to avoid other disadvantages.
This process must be carried out in an open and closed eye.
However, unlike the apex, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities that exist for the misfortunes to escape other misfortunes, here they only used the rotating movement and the acceleration as a possibility for the car robot and the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have greater energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important is the instinctive and intelligent reaction, not the data processing capacity, nor much less the storage capacity.
This device must only process some input signals in each second and react as appropriate.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan's calculations, can be incorporated into the models manufactured in series within ten years.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles that exist in his path.
He's got a name for this lovely boy.
The written version of the Financial Redemption Package Act of $700 billion has been prepared, which will be implemented in several stages with a view to purchasing bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to the time of the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until after Saturday night, convention leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial rescue package, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Congress, saying that there is only a need to formalise the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: this programme will work and will be effective but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about returning it to the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington schedule (or before two in the morning of Monday, according to Central Europe timetable), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the draft law called Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the first Monday will be voted by the American Congress and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted Pelosi on Saturday night and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The programme is different from the original Bush administration proposal to spend all the $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Only half of the $700 billion can now be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, will the Ministry of Finance buy credit, bad grades and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congress decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach: it can simultaneously buy bad credit, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" credit.
The purchase may be made either in auctions or directly - the competent persons of the ministry have been informed.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements by which companies will pay the amount for the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, is about the purchase of bad financial resources, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the dismantling of some major financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks who are in a hurry to expect State aid may have the official limitation of their compensations, which the North American Argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to limitations, depending on the form of assistance from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of a auction, an additional tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank's failed boss is retired.
By buying bad credit directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the bosses' compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the restrictions refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in North American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the income of the directors-democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Congress commission, who is responsible for financial services, commented on this.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of contributors, as they can ultimately even gain profits from the transaction when the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay the financial sector losses to contributors.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations with respect to the project.
This is not what the US citizens have ordered us, that is, the taxpayers' dollars are not being protected - California's Republican congressman Darrell Issa said.
His Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures encouraged him by the same ones who are responsible for the demolition of Wall Street.

The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical production branch (1.6 per cent).
Price decreases were made in the petrochemical sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as, to a minimum, in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
They did not change the prices of paper manufacture, publishing and printing.
The rest of the processing industry recorded an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight in domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 per cent was recorded in August, first of all as a result of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a 12-month comparison - in the domestic sales of the processing industries - the higher price increases were recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 per cent).
An increase of 13.2 per cent was observed in the metal processing sector, while in the food, beverages and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, an increase of 11 per cent was observed.
Price decreases were recorded in the textile industry (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent).

Will next year no longer need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for about 12 January to enter into force the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of it in Chicago, in front of the Hungarian residents there.
In his opinion, "precisely everything depends on building the electronic access and control system on time on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that the entry premium would disappear in the new system, but tourists should be registered before leaving the country of origin.
From today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with the Secretary of State Condolezza Rice by delivering the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with international policy advisers from candidates to the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties, assured their support on Sunday for the $700 million bank assistance programme of the administration, but there were politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and Administration, after several days of marathon negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: an agreement was reached on principles on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and de-frozen the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues were first introduced, Obama regained some advantage and lost the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the republican convention with Sarah Palin ' s candidacy to the Vice-President.
In a half-year of Detroit's campaign, held last Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress would soon adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) the employment, the savings of you, as well as the entire industry and the stability of the whole economy are at risk" - he said to a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take advantage of the opportunity to qualify as obsolete McCain's economic concepts.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "we'll all get away with this for a long time (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Fines and the limitation of executive compensation, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no important role to play in the consultations, instead he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen would probably vote on Monday on the bill.
German-speaking area press magazine
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In the electronic edition of the German magazine on the left, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed his office.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and right now these modern citizens are the ones who are giving their backs.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago , in 1998 the CSU reached 47.7 per cent , for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s .
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still during the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents .
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and settlement of the Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases opportunities and also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group became the most conscious, more critical and more testing voters.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks, the conventional groups of citizens have been the ones who have distanced themselves from the CSU; the autonomous, small industrialists, those who have the Bachelorate and the diplomats.
Thus, CSU's support was reduced to less than 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
Vienna's conservative newspaper: "Who with? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved for coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
The EPO prohibits the involvement of the SPO in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens do not yet wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties just let some of their barricades see.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, in the vice chancellor's position.
He claimed that in any event they rejected Schüssel-Multererer's era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Manyer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to get involved in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party by Fidesz, in her message addressed to the whole, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the dominant foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organisations attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of Fidesz's group of Members in the European Parliament - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma people remain outside the labour market first because of their low level of education.
"Most young Gypsys have not completed high school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can get university degrees."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing enjoyment of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Euro MP, it is necessary to be fully aware of these issues between the Roma and the non-Gypsies.
As soon as a Gypsy student starts school, he will have more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must guarantee them the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - Livia Járóka stressed.
According to the Euro MP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of school egregation immediately, and it is essential that the proper implementation of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be carried out.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the opportunity to guarantee the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," said Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised annually since last year's Berlin meeting, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to provide a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national levels of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed Duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the severe electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, and the debate on personal issues has now been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, prime minister of the province are still in his office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a 17 per cent disastrous electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary convention of the party to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of such a duo criticised have been questioned: they are not so attached to their positions.
This was intended to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and of their base organization, who one day after the "bávaro tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although led by Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 per cent, but now, one year after the attack against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future, there is no doubt that they will have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the Party's restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister for Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that launches negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Right-Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the destination is that on the list of the Free Voters, that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken for the coup d'état Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly deleted from the scene to the ambitious local policy.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also have an active role that has so far been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial government chief and former CSU president qualified on September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel themselves as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel cannot be cancelled unless they are unable to highlight together the CSU that played a crucial role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hide her disappointment for failure, the loss of the CSU would not have a negative impact on the large Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the social democrat crisis continues.
The SPD with 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the welfare and stability guaranteed in the country of Alexandr Lukashenko, in exchange for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
Although the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of one hundred and ten Members, has not been opposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "allow" the entry of some members of the opposition to parliament.
So ODSZ removed the boycott he originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly facing Russia and which contributed to the sale of Russia to Beltransgaz, the owner of the pipeline passing through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which did not allow Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians to enter into an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a sign of disengagement when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on errors - such as the ban on the participation of one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary Monday report criticised even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in counting the votes.
With all this in mind, the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears that even an opponent will be allowed to enter that Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but rather tries to get voters their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more those who support the change among older people as well - Milinkevich said, arguing that the Lukashenko regime, which believes its main outcome is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or even the pensioners, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the decomposition of social security that "seems to be the silence of the cemetery" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers opposed the opposition's policy and described them as democratics in the elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Rio Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts," so that the lack of opposition is nothing but a witness to the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of the Chigi Palace that set up automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from now on it starts with this action against the guy who's stuck and then goes to the bar to take a coffee at work.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, greater presence and more services," the minister says.
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is open.
This is Reformism", he underlines again Brunetta.
With the Chigi Palace, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "There has been a change shared by the workers and there has been cooperation on the part of the workers".
Finally, I no longer have breakfast at work; no more coffee and mid-months.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchin at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absence of public employees' diseases has been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in one year".
It adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics – the minister explains – have been double over the private sector in the last 8-10 years and above the inflation rate".
For the time being, millions of public employees have joined in opposing the rules of the Brunetta Decree by complying with the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the slightest lack of work for causes of disease – writes consumer association – the people of the 'vague workers' are constantly increasing.
In Italy there are millions of employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war to the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, Tar contests the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by disease due to service; the extension of the time zones in which medical visits to the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Labour Accidents, Naples: "Cross Prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths in relation to homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data broadcast by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association Mutated and Disabled by Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favour of workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has been manifested, a 'suffering', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, by their dimensions, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, instead the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napoleon does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It is particularly important to take the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep an eye on the phenomenon alive, not to block the alarm on social gravity, to implement and improve legislation.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has stressed "as the phenomenon of white death constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to bring an urgent end."
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white deaths as impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We really don't want this "trend to decline" to be translated into less attention, because it's just when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, at our criterion - Mercandelli has highlighted – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"It serves a further effort - it has added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has reported "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection for victims of work" and "assistance to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim is to give the worker back the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of the person who is injured does not depend on the gift given by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers in charge, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
As regards the European Commission, in a communication published in Brussels, the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour per day with the high volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-level cellular phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence – followed by Ue – there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and deliver this information to the public.
We must re-examine, in addition to existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that it caused.
"Scientists - executive Ue concludes - confirm that it is a cause of concern and the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and stakeholders that measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical apparatus."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concerns increase as the auditory damage that may result from an excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit many of these damage by resorting to solutions such as reduction of levels and time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices hear loud (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit for the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This means that 5-10 per cent of the users of these devices are affected and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today, the accounts will be closed in March.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Termas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the municipal council evaluated analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its deputy Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to stress German – it should provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the council and the municipal council can then be assessed.
There is no leftover position of roles, just the desire to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
Work will disappear in March, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – the lieutenant announces – we will present the strategic plan using the Commission's work on the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission accuses of useless, since its opinions are not binding, Germany answers: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested back.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and beyond the long term, in a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
The Rome agent also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to make them participate and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For Germany, indeed, "you need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have an absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, according to Rome's steward, "would not only be limited to the present municipal borders but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and should develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that interests him to pass independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and piped relations (as he does today's private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
has written a Miami lady on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: believe that he won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!".
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of voters: Will it be a good president? And there are polls; they all say that Obama won and with good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A daily newspaper in Mississippi, in the interior of the South of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the polling room, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality covered up to the last.
"Say what they want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll go to America.
things never said before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
Have 1,500 people been asked: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to rot in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make suitcases.
Also, Iraq for the most part has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever will take over George W's position will have a huge duty to develop.
Use, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet for the "murder" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Yes, journalists today are almost all pessimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where editors work to carry out the newspaper, this is a major problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if you do not want traditional journalism as most people understand it to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the U.S. journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Print against emission.
It is not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "murder" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" by journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – or the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of national executives are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage is lower to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with the "safety of work".
Executives who intend to lose their position in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
That of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation such as the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "getting it or leaving it".
Directors are almost always well paid, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, but retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 complete days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "enferman" followed during the year.
It's a whole climate issue.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROMANIA, DANILO KOPPOLA IS GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the area of the anti-agreement investigation concerning the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained the house release, turning it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate owner travel the city road from the province to a capital room.
According to the court, these travels (by which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elects at Risk
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago by the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times gives us a confirmation yesterday informing us that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, in exchange, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, especially strong in the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, in fact, has become dominant with the vote of the one who spoke at the outset.
This is just quoted as an example of the mutations, the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Both in the United States and in Europe the crisis has long seemed to work as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that are solidified and going out into the light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual state-sovereignity category in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking institutions - financial institutions that have, if any, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, much more committed to the balance sheets of families living in one country and in one state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who rule it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which is divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach any common policy decision.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and, above all, the grant of funds: from the moment it comes to the court, it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy matters.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, values under certain circumstances in which no market is likely to and no organisation can ever have the same amount.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-of-the-nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute a very closely linked factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of intangibles, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future would have to be in exchange for more and more accounts with the few intangible things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth but are also combined in absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So he who is a sovereign has certainly many more letters than he is, and he who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaders, of an inadequate economic nature with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a denial, intolerance, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in a growing number.
It seems that more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions were the same as those of the social elites so far growing, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the inclusive exception of the term, had made the time itself and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a few words, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are reflected in an electoral "rebellion" or in the sudden changes in collective humour of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavier to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and you also face the victory of the right in Italy that has something to see).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say something, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what has been taking shape since today are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis is renewable, increasing and potentially exacerbating.
First of all, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Conquering the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like a spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has approached a lot.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of those who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of sticking can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaghetti pile," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the legs of gecos, covered with microscopic hair that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and lilac paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "is easily removed from the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WAIT BY THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Can you walk through the walls just like the spider man? Can you? But researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University in California is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesion.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that automatically cleanse themselves of dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juice
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if they are taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, the efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged as fresh ones associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who has been sending a new alarm to Philadelphia since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society in progress: just a glass of apple juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The apple juice had already been blamed for being held responsible for increasing at toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, ansiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines.
PHARMACOS A RISKS – The same Italian drug agency had reported in a news bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active principles inhibited by apple and other games.
This is where Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, called: "These findings are generally referred to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide for changing the information notes.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly to the doctor or pharmacist” stressed the expert from the Ansa Agency.
The New Economy in Paul Krugman
The noble economic prize has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and about the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Keynesian novel that teaches at Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack on Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that is very controversial and that has been reproached for several years, but that has now been precisely revealed.
“I’m a little surprised and a little upset because the memory of Enron’s and Worldcom’s collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but also a publicist with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here is the third edition of "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open-source personal productivity suite that aims to attract ever more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost one year from the voluntary developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: on the welcome screen and the less greasy magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also put to multi-functioning with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via email, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "hybrid PDF" documents that accumulate the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: on the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of amendments, in drafting texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to English in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD at home or at work may also be sent on request.
And if the topic of free can be a loophole for house dissemination, it is in the business area that Open Office tests the suite, try the big bet, and can already have a number of projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that provide an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writes the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of PowerPoint; Dbase, to eat in the case of known Access is the program that allows you to work on the base date; and last Draw the graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to get to 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the planned figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl results positive is the fourth doping case
New positive case in the tour of France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, third ranking and winner of the best ski lift.
To give the news is the site of the L'Equipe newspaper.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive corridor to the third generation era, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also them of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood samples are among those performed in the last few weeks at the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position on the Tour and will be angry at the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm Kohl's positive doping news in the third generation era is the head of the French antidoping agency Pierre Bordery, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has been placed on the podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding the best climber.
INSTRUMENTS: NEW YORK TIMES ARE YOU QUESTIONED, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy from an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" hosted with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a racist nation? That's what the New York Times is asking for in a long article devoted to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a cookie box.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also the country's highest anti-immigrant feeling and the highest support of the North League".
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation sought by the League also supports the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm for climate change in Italy.
The trend is marked by the Pope who by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to combat racism".
Students victims of rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the tenant union, renting an individual room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large portion of young people at the highest cost that the family would have to bear – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents."
Except that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free, non-registered, canon-free, under-linked rentals.
Extraordinary interventions are needed for Sunia to be able to regulate prices through the revision of the tax.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, by a bed in the Brianza area, they serve around 450 euros; for an individual room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Black area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students focus on areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros per bed in a double room and 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you will be asked for about 600 euros for an individual room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you change the peripheral area: 300 euros per bed and 450 for an individual room in the Prenestina area, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples, you get 300/450 euros per bed, a room spends 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in the most girls cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where renting to students and non-Communitys is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old movie Paradise, the cities cancel the historical rooms
Historic cinematographic rooms close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic rooms in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by Director Giuseppe Tornatore photographes effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalizing the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticians in the peripheral and the consequent disappearance of the monorooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the features of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is as if a friend died, a friend with whom there was a piece of space and so much emotion," notes the director of the new Paradise movie, the film that twenty years ago won the Oscar and the grand jury award to Cannes, who counted the poetry of a movie hall in the province and the nostalgia for the way of living the movie that may have been lost forever.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and most of the rooms in the main cities are mostly paid: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romania with 82 less cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the adventure of the multiplex, these three Italian regions themselves that have made the largest number of new methic cinemas: 195 screens but in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romania.
"Italian exercise has evolved irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it would be useful for new structures to be built but it would be necessary to ensure the existence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to move to the Meticians.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector, it would cost between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million a year.”
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned by the closures, decided to repair itself with the signature of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be at the historical centre rather than the peripheral.
Among the proposed rules are medium tax relief for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators may enter the restricted traffic area and have special parking rates.
"It's an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true that in contrast to the extra power of the meticians, traditional rooms need to improve sound and image quality because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema was a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I go ahead to the Rialto or the National Road Quirinale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the cartels fed by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Link between politics and 'andrankheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for those interested in the Pyromalli cosca."
The accusations made by the judges of the Anti-Timafia Directorate of Calabria to the lieutenant and deputy lieutenant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the lieutenant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by Mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer's grandson, boss's homonymist, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Despite any legal and moral norms, and in good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to counsel Piromalli.
"The Mafia family - the judges write - would have been allowed to enter the municipality officially by facilitating the large possibility of control and control of public administration."
The president of the Agazio Loiero regional chalabres board does not hide that "agreements between ill-organized life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'andranheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests are added to those of last July after the police had announced the trial of the Mafia Pirolli family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised from the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, lieutenant, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the roundup to May 2006, had been elected head of a right-wing coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I appeal to the vice-minister of the interior who was Marco Minniti at that time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the order of arrest signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for a variation of the A3 road project.
Of the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the availability to support the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Pyromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of Mafia families".
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage
It is an exhausted deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of low oil, in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil are driving the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea.
This amount would be the double of the current output by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and more among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy – the spokesperson for a company associated with the US oil coliseum at the Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is quite an important signal, if it is considered that the US in Alaska continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently launched a plan to carry out new drillings.
In addition to Chevron it is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are still talking about technology at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, a technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good unity between them.
The strength of the waves, which makes the good move upwards and downwards becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
There are now four implants of this kind on the development path, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve as a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial center and parking, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotates the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, is currently worth the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the tides that you, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and is expected to invest 35 million for 2009.
