Calling the World
Market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and calls and calls out in nature have gone to people around the world.
"You have the collegiate, I need Iceland," says a woman out in the big world in a statement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.
Another eye - catching greeting will keep Iceland in its heart for all eternity, and a young woman is told that she must come directly to the end of Iceland, where she will have her first stay.
Sadly, however, she is in the United States, and she plans to have to wait for a few months.
Another outstanding question is whether the route to Iceland is successful, for there are no airplanes.
The story does not tell us if it comes from a different time period.
Eigill Thordarson at the Peel Advertising Centre, which made the announcements together with the M&C Saatchi International Advertising Centre, says that receptions have been hoped for.
“I have found many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already under review.
Basically, it's about creating a PR value, it's about getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's been incredibly good.
In relatively short periods of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets worldwide that totals nearly two billion people.
The value of the survey is estimated at SEK 1.8 billion.
It's not practical."
The world’s leading market is the United States, and the military has been doing very well there, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, such markets as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been well received, such as Russia, who are pleasantly surprised.
Then came a reaction from foreign areas, such as India, which was not particularly addressed.
"These advertisements have traveled beyond what we expected," says Eagle, but this may mean that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The pictures on the open page were taken by Arni Säberg, the photographer of the morning newspaper, on a series of advertisements bearing the title "Let It Out" in the middle of the last month.
And the standard of the camp went out wide, as at the going up of the school of the guard in Reykjavík, and in Reynis-fir, and in the wood, and in the wood, and in the brasen place, and in the cave of the stork, and in the cave of the high places.
Samuel Bjarki son of Peter and Gunnar Paul Olaf son of Shoti productions and took the fear of the Son of God.
The Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary, took part in the teasing.
At the same time, the announcements were carried out in the South, another group in the West and West Virginia.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is intended to conduct a winter campaign in cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Chamber,” says Eagle, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has worked very well.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign employees with knowledge of the limits we are talking to."
Explosives: Talking about the labour market, the cost of living, and many more
Asmundur Einar Dadasson, a social and children's councillor, meets in Splendid, which starts at ten o'clock today at the Castle.
He is also a labour market adviser and talks about the situation on the labour market as such, the Icelandair issue and other issues.
He also discusses rural matters and the transport of people to a land that has been bad and has been distributed for decades.
Toór Ingólfsson, president of the VR, also takes part in the debate, but he will discuss his criticism of the foundations of life-saving money, and presents ideas that labour movements and professionals will withdraw from the management of the seas to reduce the risk of profits.
They will then be discussed with Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveling minister in the Orient, and Arnheidi Johnsdother, the CEO of the Northern Markets Department, about the location of the country’s travel services.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading prediction of what will come.
You can listen to the part below, but it starts at ten o'clock.
That's what she looks like today 25 years later
The play of Elisha Donovan had a successful career in youth performances of every kind.
However, she won her game as Amber in the 25 - year - old movie of Clueless.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has passed away, but she was allowed to watch the road and express herself about Cluess on the Austrian television of the day.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says that she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the person of the highest degree on girls I met in school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who these people were," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Don't want to leave the police station after midnight
Some 50 cases were reported on by the police in the capital area today, and the police daily newspaper reported that the case had changed greatly.
The day at the police station in Wärfis Street began with the need for police to have a deal with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after his death.
If the man did not want to leave after he had been released, he would not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
Because of his progress, the man entered the police station to continue his stay.
Then you were arrested in the morning, suspected of breaking into a company in Kopavoga.
Police were also required to have two men in Broadland because of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at a shopping mall in Kopavog was unable to pay for the final meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car accident was also reported in the middle of the morning.
The driver’s white van looked at her for hours, and she was then taken in by a free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Gladys — The Terrible Destiny of the Gleasters
This theory has flown on the Internet to curse the scene of the Gladys Army, but the playwright Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and thus became the third major player to make life a long time ago.
The imagery of the gladiatorium (e. g. Glee) is a popular feature of singing, dancing, and rejoicing.
The imagery of the so - called happy youth at school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always easy to be in the gladiatorial camp, but through singing and dancing, the individuals seemed to be able to overcome any circumstances that arose in their lives.
But beyond the shelters, there have been great tragedies for players and employees, so much so that the teachings have raised the curse on the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez, a runner who did not call all his grandmother.
After the show had run its course, Rivera went to own the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Riveru was missing after her four - year - old son was alone on a boat on the Lake Pira waters of California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a lifeboat aboard the boat and could tell the police that he and his mother had made a break and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but had never returned there.
A lot of research on Rivera started.
The day after the check began, the police officer in the area found out that we were looking after Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially sentenced to death.
She is said to have suffered from a heavy flow of water and to have used her last demands to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded as being drowned by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson, the American footballer with the angelic fortune that played a key role in bringing the Gladys Army to honor and respect.
Yet, without the elements, Moneith escaped from personal hell.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with drugs.
In 2013, his collaborators found that his involvement in the field ministry was sufficient, and he took action and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look all the better.
Only two months after finishing treatment, Moneith felt killed in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banemin was a lethal mixture of vibes and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a willful act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance for vertebrates had decreased so much that his previous well - tolerated dose was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His soul was heavy upon his fellow workers, but his opponent’s wife, Leah Michele, was determined to continue to participate and to devote the entire part to the memory of Moneith and of Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the contests, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his colleagues in the Gladys Army, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of child pornography.
In his search for a home, he found a huge amount of child pornography, and the matter soon became public.
It was obvious that Salling had already been there.
He was later charged and charged with wrongdoing.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as what he would have to do with having a record of sex offenders and seeking treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then released from custody, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
They were not just actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant manager.
He fell asleep in 2013, just 41 years of age.
We also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not share her beautiful story, but she accused Robert of great self - control and contempt.
Motes took his own life in 2014, but she copes with severe depression.
She left a letter to her mistress, where she invited her mother and sister, among other things, to take responsibility for the way she was treated.
“My mother and so-called sister get nothing from me except the memory that they were my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star.
She has recently been accused of using her partner’s tools and passage points and of having superfluous stars.
Jesse Luken took part in the event in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for a full - time record in 2019, which was severely disrupted.
The play of Heather Morris played a major role in the subjects.
For that reason, in 2010 it became apparent that unscrupulous computers came into contact with nuclei and appeared on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the event and had a love affair outside.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had resorted to violence in his relationship.
It's possible to put flowers on almost everything
It increases children’s development when they play outdoors with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and grow.
It can also be done with flowers as pointed out by the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the magic, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Buy a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's schools," says Axel Orn Djimmundsson, who spends the summer fishing season studying psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter."
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer vacation when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good catch, and I think it’s great to be able to miss out on a Bible study.
The drinks also make me fit into the winter," says Axel Orn Djimmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who spends summer fishing like the previous summer.
Axel was the most recent brewer on Talknafird when a journalist arrived late at night at the beginning of the week."
“The weather I was in the tenth grade took me to the command of a boat that was under 12 feet [12 m] long and I bought my boat in the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartman, the son of Jon, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped sailing, and he was very pleased when he saw that it bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I was fishing.
So I had the boat unladen at the end of this first summer on it."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just graduated from primary school?
“I had already put in and collected money, I had been working with my father when I was a boy, I was all fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat."
And Axel was born in Izphard, and all his mother's house: he dwelt in Coopavor, because he was a son.
“I can hunt here in the western part of the country because I have a law home with my grandmother in Isafari.
I learned in this area for the west of the riverbed with my father.
I'm going to go between places, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area is all over the West.
Although I feel better about the West, I have also been serving around the Snowflake and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but then most of the grace," says Axel, who always hits one fire early in the morning and sometimes speaks to the moose and sings to the sky, alone at times together on a balloon.
“The internet is good on the sea, so I can call, listen to music and music.
I don't think it's a matter of being alone on a boat.
Of course I'm trying to avoid landing in a rabbit, but of course sometimes something has been in the weather, but never a great risk," says Axel, who is lucky to have never been in a sea.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishermen walk each time.
“I’ve never been fishing in the beach for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been caught for one and a half hours in a bite outside the sea fishing.”
The arrangement in the beaches says he is able to catch a thousand pounds [770 kg] a day, which he feels he is tired of.
“The other obstacles are that I cannot catch on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only catch 12 days a month, these four months as beach hunters stand, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, seamen should choose their fishing days after the weather and none else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to rest instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose from their heads.
So the area change could also go because of me, and a sea-place that is well located with the fish should enjoy it," says Axel, who reduces the maximum amount of cod from the salt sea on its beach, but also only the smell and unique other species flow with.
Axel works in the wintertime with the university drama at the Nupi school in Kopavogi.
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's schools," says Axel, proud and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the school.
“I am stuck there because I feel that this is a wonderful job.
I hope that the psychology study will benefit me in the future," says Axel, who has also come a long way from commercial science.
Error in registering prevented from registering for homecoming
An error in a record sheet that people fill when it comes to the country caused a person, who lived in the country, not to be called back into the exhibition.
There is no requirement to enter a license number if the applicant completes the certificate in English, as is the case when it is made in Icelandic.
“ This will be considered during the week, ” says a sociologist.
Three internal infections were detected in the field of virology of the Landspitalan yesterday.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the so - called homeward rules were valid.
Those who lived in Iceland were then ridiculed for coming to the country, and they were back in sight four to five days later.
On the other hand, according to lunch news reports, the person in question would have been following the old system.
The scene on the border was negative, and it was not called back in the scan for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusut, an expert in the field of genetics, says that this may lead to an error in the journal.
If you fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.
After all, it has been thought of primarily for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the patient did not receive an automatic invitation to take the sample.
Kamilla, however, says that although they have completed the English registration form, in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to the exhibition after they arrived.
“ This will be considered in the week how to facilitate people’s access to this to attract their attention to the procedure. ”
The man is single, and six have been put into captivity.
They all went to the theater, but two of them started to show symptoms.
Smashing is now under way with the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is largely over due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, an Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a deviation from the corona virus that has not been previously found here.
On the other hand, although Israel is known to have moved the virus to other European countries, the link is that the person who moved the virus to the country has also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that tomorrow should be where the virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to the COVID. is web site.
135 are on the alert.
Four out of fivefects not connected
Five internal injuries have been reported here in the former days.
Four of them are completely disconnected and are not to be found the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup last night.
Smearing is still ongoing.
Originally, on the third century C.E., they were sent into captivity, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are affected by these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is a second time in a short time that has been identified in sports events, and it has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
John K. Johnsson, a liaison officer at the State Police Department, says that it is very slow, as long as people follow guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly caring for all those who live here who need to maintain personal protection.
We also need to make sure that there are certain rules that are in place.
Then it is possible to hold events," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by holding on to personal antimicrobials.
The rules and guidelines are also in constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the public sector and the country’s medical department are constantly caring for people, is to think about these personal antimicrobials.
Both at home and in the same way in service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection from going on," says John.
“We need to make sure that people continue on the good road we were on, in order to keep up with the success that we have achieved here.”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was getting his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was killed.
Breathing was caused by sudden difficulty in breathing due to coronation.
Diabetes was reported as a major problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is afraid of dying from this.
The Reuters news campaign doesn't say the fear of Brumfield is groundless.
The number of new studies conducted by the U.S. authorities shows that 40% of those who died of diabetes 2 as a underlying disease have been lost.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the proportion increases to half.
A study of the U.S. Cooperative Monitoring (CDC) found more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronary virus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a specialist in CDC infections, says that the results are successful, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Hidden in the slow growth of Reuters was investigated and the responses from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions were indicated.
10 kingdoms, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to report underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already growing in the late stages of slow growth.
Now COVID–19 has broken into a powerful age," Reuters has said after Elbert Huang, head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes is more common among black people and people of South American origin, who have also been worse off the coronary virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease healthy, healthy, and healthy.
However, the age of coronation has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine for a week.
There has been a high need for insulin to continue to work and to avoid exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 may be suffering from the virus.
When the SARS corona virus went over in 2003, almost 20% of them had the disease, and in the 2009 swine fever age, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When the MERS was carried out in 2012, one study revealed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to diabetes nursery had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effect of the COVID-19 virus could longer have been similar to that of a number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, president of the international diabetes epidemic.
Doctors have warned that the age of corona virus has been indirectly associated with an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and renal excretion.
Like direct new studies, the corona virus could lead to an increase in diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the connection between the coronary virus and diabetes 2
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, which are already diseased in many people with diabetes.
The proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetes patients may then be caused by a genuine "cell message storm", as is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged congenital cells may also lead to inflammation that can cause a fatal clot.
"It's all one big puzzle game," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to the inside."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited to a campavin, so they left the room."
The wife of Asrún Magnusdotti and Atli Bollason met with the unusual request of the artist Ragnar Kjartans Son to commit sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so this wasn't complicated."
Thus, Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother - in - law, the daughter of Asrunu Magnus.
“I was very relieved of her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then she also made me very rudely cute.
And he still feels," he says.
In turn, the husband also remembers that the first meeting was held on a regular basis.
“I’ve always heard this story.
Last weekend only," she says, who also got to her husband at first.
“I felt and felt so excited around Atlas, which I love.
There's a lot going on and there's a lot going on, and I'm getting better at it."
Atli says that they have stressed their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t bind our bags with the same knots as our companions.
We avoid the routine that we find around us."
This may be the reason why they took the tribute from Ragnar Kjartan’s son to the artist’s joy, even though it would be most unusual to say so.
“Christine Anna, our mutual friend, has contact with us and asks if we can come and eat the desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörga, Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the triad at Snaps, and received desert wine and wine each time.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his art exhibition project that he was planning to set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a variety of video works called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Astrún says that he described his work as a banal and decadent late in Western life.
“He had sketches of all the time he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted us to know if we were interested in participating.”
Later, Ragnar asked the couple to join in showing young intersperses to love in a minimal room.
"These are conversations with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar very well, but they knew him and he did.
They said that they did not want to advertise in public.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people but people who were sexually tempted to perform for others."
They invited Ragnar and agreed to consider the matter, but it did not take long.
“ When we ran out of Snaps, we said: ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Azrun and Atli.
“This Is About Love and Closeness ”
Later, he was taken to a nice apartment on the Myrna Street.
There was a very well - known film show; the film director, Ragnar, and the audience, and the couple.
After the recording had been activated, everyone left the room to wait in a car except for Atli and Azrun.
“We haven’t decided what we should be.
We received some brief instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we are doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asrún.
But was this romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli and Azrun agree.
“We were invited to a campavin before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommie looked at this, he cried, but it was so beautiful to him, ” says Atli.
“This is as much about love and affection as it is about communication itself,” says Asrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the son’s voice at the Reykjavik List Hall and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and goes to jail in this, ” says Atli.
“Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone about this, but then my dad just texted me and said, "It's nice to pick up the little family in Palais de Tokyo," says Asrún.
And would participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Assruña and Atlas?
“At least we’re still together so maybe this deepened something.
At the same time, it deepened my relationship with my family," says Asrún and laugh.
Asrún himself saw the work in Kuppman's name with his colleague.
"I found it a bit difficult not to be with you but to be with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
“ But it’s nice to see this because it’s just one late in a much bigger work, and when you see it with the other things, it’s very nice.
I could do something to get rid of this and I was just proud.
And there was little beans in my stomach," says Asrún, who was pregnant with another child of the couple when she was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them in the love stories of Ras.
Swansea with victory in the first subcolor game
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the subspecies of the round to arrive in the English Selection Department.
The game took place at the home of Swansea in Wales.
The position in the middle was 0–0.
Swansea residents were exposed at 64 minutes, but Andre Ayew broke the archaic from the point of view and was protected.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, the player Brentford, got the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less and at 82 minutes Swansea took advantage of the team.
Andre Ayew then improved the winning team by scored a great goal and won Swansea 1–0.
Swansea thus leads to 1–0 in the single, but the second game will take place on the next Wednesday at Brentford home.
Unmanaged for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, a U.S. missionary in Iceland, is in the newsroom after CBS reported that this morning he wanted an armed lifeguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been without effort for the President of the United States to order missionaries here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned from the U.S. Missionary Office in April 2009, she has been completely free to serve in the country for over 62 months.
Van Voorst left his office under special circumstances, but from 2009, Castelius reported that she should have received the Password.
As she greeted the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the president’s office on the subject that she would not be ashamed of the word.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international trade with Army War College.
Sixteen months later, the deputy Van Voorst came to work in September 2010.
Somehow, Robert S. Connan may have been ordered to be a missionary but stopped.
Finally, Louis Ariega had served in the foreign field for decades.
He thus quit his job in the autumn of 2013 and took up the office of missionary in Guatemala.
Then, another unmanaged period of time took place.
Robert Barber agreed to U.S.A. in January 2015 and soon came to work, but no envoy had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically ordained but not diplomatic, but he had served as a lawyer and a short voter for Barack Obama.
He quit his job as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on 20 January 2017, as usual with political envoys.
The Trump government was unusual in order to order both ambassadors and to place officials in the government system in Washington.
So it took two years for the United States to announce to Jeffrey Ross Gunter in his meeting to ask him the questions and confirm to the end that he was a missionary in Iceland.
In his testimony on the matter, he never said he had come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been broken from the Dutch mountains.
Gunter is a political leader, formerly a skin doctor in California and has been a prominent member of Jewish organizations in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The playwright owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, and Adelson is a keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no envoy had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is that both the length of Trump’s rule was to appoint key officials and that last year’s U.S. work was very long, including the confirmation of ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, therefore, a five - year - old government in Iceland has been uninhabited.
However, this has not prevented the implementation of the mission council, which opened the new headquarters of Anjateig.
The performances are estimated to have cost some 6.5 billion, but the wall of the safety structure is closed and the window of the window is closed.
However, it does not seem that they have enough to fill the current missionary security claim because he is said to be afraid of his life and wishes to have an armed lifeguard.
Former IBV player for racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tony Mawejje, a former IBV player, said that he had become a racist when he was in Iceland and that he noticed that he had come to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tony on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tony recently joined the Uganda Police FC team playing in the top of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tony talks about a lot, including his time here in the country, while he played with IBV, Val, and Drotto in Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's predecessor was in that position, but he also had the number of trees I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tony, while he played on the right-hand corner of the IBV game.
Among Tony’s talks is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“ It came once to me, but since I did not understand the language, I simply ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what was going on.
He said to me, 'My adversary has brought reproach on me, and now that I have mocked him.'
In 2014, Tony moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees as much as possible.
Tony had not been able to get to the original team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the country.
Then he asked to return to Iceland for a loan, but he went to Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," Tony says, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get longer.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made up his dreams of reaching the grandeur of Europe.
Find a worm in the neck of a woman
A doctor at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-mile long black worm in a woman's neck that was looking for there.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with his tongue.
A study revealed that this was a small animal.
CNN reports on this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashim, which is thin flesh.
The woman quickly improved after the worm was removed, but insects, such as these, are often in raw meat or fish.
After Sushi went to bed in the West, cases where insects have spread into people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear of Other Waves to Start in Europe
Spain is now in a burning state in connection with concerns about another wave of the Coronation Virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the Coronation Virus.
In Catalonia, all fun lives have been iced for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where the infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infection in Spain, but in Britain everyone has to go to bed at home from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
In France and Germany, AIDS is also being reinvigorated, where governments are trying to find the balance between the spread of the virus and the recovery of economic life.
The situation in Europe, however, is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is about 300 thousand per day, with the largest infection in America and South Asia.
The confirmed infection has become 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University, and there are deaths confirmed in connection with the virus of 644 thousand.
Moses ’ works eventually bring the full enjoyment of their work
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavik there is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men with orange gel.
There's also a big grave.
And more less machines.
The gate is closed for transport.
However, the walk is efficient, and there are now many who respect and admire the works of millions of mosaics — as never before seen.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it's not worth it.
The work here has been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it were vehicles that were always surrounded.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and so moved on to their peace in the city center.
"Live and multi-variable public space" and "rescuing urban space" are the main features of the restoration of the security street now under way.
The aim is to enhance the beauty of the area and allow the mosaics of the Holy See at the Toll House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work will be a square, and where the area is good for the sun, it is considered suitable as a sleeping area for pedestrians.
The artist’s work will be clarified, and now the material will enjoy better than ever on this 142 - square - foot [142 sq m] field.
In the area there will also be small "woody", some kinds of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area certain warmth.
In this way, the replacements are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is under construction along with Veit.
Waterworks, heat plants and power plants will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but the schools and cold water systems have since 1925, so they have served the inhabitants and businesses in the middle of the Middle Ages.
When the street is reopened, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a unique and gradually more peaceful and accessible space for walking.
In a survey of the Tollhus on the customs administration’s website, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldörsson.
Because of the fact that the beam reached through the house, a 250 - foot - wide [250 m] windowless wall was formed in the street.
The Building Committee and the architect agreed that such sheets would have a bad impact on the overall street if no specific arrangements were made to smooth out the appearance of the house.
So the members agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent artwork.
At that time, many words of Type Helgadóthar, an artist, were spoken in the collection.
She had worked hard at mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
The decision was to have first contact with her before deciding whether she would compete for the job.
Often, the work had to reflect life on the sea, and the sea had been a lifelong sea of Reykjavik since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she had to deal with the subject of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from a foreign country, where she would work with the foreign suggestions.
When she returned home, she made some suggestions for the discussion.
She was immediately granted permission to ask her to work.
In addition, it was requested to conclude an overall agreement with it and the famous works of art in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, who had long worked with them to establish famous works of art throughout Europe.
The arrangements were made, and Gerd worked under the construction of the works of the brothers who then saw the construction of the Toll House.
All the work was particularly well done, both by the Helgadodt, and by the Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Has it ever been the case for an unscrupulous Icelandic race?
It took him about two years to work, which was established in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the work was finished, just 47 years old.
Preparing to move more agencies out of the country
Asmundus Einar Dadasson, a social minister, announces that more public agencies will be transferred to the country next.
That's what the Councilman in the Explosive on the Castle said at noon.
Recently it was reported that the Fire Department of Housing and Human Activity Agency is being transported north to South Africa in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of tanning work at the establishment, but none of them are willing to follow the establishment north and the National Association of Disinfective and Disease Carriers has criticised the buffer transfers.
“I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing more steps in this creature.
More transfers," said Asmundur.
Is he convinced that the vast majority of the nation would like to see more public agencies spread throughout the country?
“I think it is necessary to make more political decisions on the transfer of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Activity Agency,” said Asmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and played a major role for communities outside the country, such as the transfer of the Food Foundation to Selfoss, the Land Measurement of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance in the Skagasstrand.
All the most since the second day of the Lord’s Evening Meal
94. Iceland’s championship in free competition ended at Thorsvelli in Akureyri today.
Some countermeasures were set up on the second day of the race.
It was calculated with an exciting competition in the women’s fight in Törsvelli, while Vigdis Jónsdotte from FH placed Icelandmet in the fight in 2014, which stood until Elizabeth Ruth Runarsdout from the IR added an assessment in May last year.
Vigdís has won the Iceland Prize earlier this summer and has been in fantastic shape at the late hour, but it has tripled Iceland’s prize of summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been coping with grief and has not reached the point of her life today.
She had only one drop of five, a drop of 25,69 feet [25,69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt, and immediately set up a countermeasure.
Her estimate of Iceland earlier in July was 62.69 feet [62.69 m], so she was somewhat of it.
Caritas Hallgrim’s daughter, from IR, had the first throw of the day, but she did her best with a throw of up to 20 feet [50.18 m].
In the men's group, the FH man won the Hilmar Örn Jonsson, the Icelandic Metaphist in a battle, a sure victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set up a counterfeet.
His estimate of Iceland in the article is 75.26 feet [75.26 m].
God’s Son, Olympia, and Iceland Meta in the circuit, won a ball game last night in Torasvelt, but today he competed in a circuit that is his main theme.
The Icelandic estimate of the gods of Vals is 65,53 feet [65,53 m], but he spent as much time as 50,30 feet [59,13 m] today and made sure of his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlandsson threw the next day, but he had a one - cast caste in the second seat, about 40 feet [49.43 m].
Havddis, the daughter of Sigurdda, a long - standing Icelandic metastases, won the long race with superpowers, but Havddis jumped at least ten feet [6.25 m] today, about 40 cm from its Icelandic metastases.
In the 200-metre race of women, the IR was the Bjordbjärg Jona Bjarnadódādīr, who was the most intruder, but she scored 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandmet in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Goddess Jona was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100-metre race and in a 4 x 100 metre message race, and in a 4 x 400 metre message race today.
In the male group Kolbein Håd Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score the 200m race at 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Māna Samuelson from Armenia.
Like God - fearing Jonah, Kolbein won the Gold Hand in 100 meters yesterday as well as 400 meters [400 m] in the race.
Don't be guilty of 27 million bitcoin crop
The Superintendent has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who was charged with crimes against a man to mismanage his financial assets resulting from the sale of the Bitcoin electricity.
The Board concludes that the tax authority did not provide a clear explanation for the need for a man to be guilty.
The Board’s decision shows that the taxable person considers that the taxable person is in a position to distinguish materially wrong tax returns due to the years 2016 and 2017.
He would have misdirected his financial resources that came from selling bitcoin’s electricity to 27 million people, whether willing or not.
The guilty man is guilty of his own conduct.
The man refused it in a letter to the committee.
However, he succeeded in selling electricity for 27 million in 2016.
She would have been buried between 2009 and 2010 when both of them had been easily and undead with a regular home arrangement.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, they were taxed because of such sales that were so obvious and unforeseeable.
It could hardly have been expected that the general public would have been aware of such tax measures.
He would not have been willing to pay taxes on the harvest and would have made his property known as a contribution to the bill of sale.
He would have asked both acquaintances and government officials how this would be done but not successful.
Then he thought it necessary to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to learn of complex rules that the tax authorities had not given themselves a clear view of.
Thus, the man rightly believed that his taxes for these two years would be repaid and applied with a measure of pressure, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He then noted that he had been working in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have failed to discharge his duties in an ungodly way.
The requirement for guilt would be completely out of the question, and it would put him in debt.
“ This man understands what football is ”
Andersen Willumsson has been a mouthpiece between people's teeth but has also aroused passion for his progress in the Pepsi Max Division.
Flashlights will be on the line tonight when they receive IA in direct transmission to Station 2 Sport.
They are then banned from the games because of four reminders during the game, so they are not allowed to play with a new cutting, as in the summer’s games.
He had written "bluff, bluff, bluff" on his hand for the game at HK last Friday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the pay, but speaking of character then, this was rather trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if someone was going to match this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said the Benedict son of the Pepsi Max, when he was thought to be Brinyelf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it’s hard to see where he is.
He looks a little out on the left side when it comes to the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Härvar Haflidjasson.
Türkell Máni Petursson says that Brynjölf really enjoys having such a colorful man in the field: “No one shares that character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to come in and answer interviews.
There are incredibly many people who are occupied with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am a fun force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjølf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Máni.
Player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in contact with a few people in the B section"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his home country, but to that end he must first terminate his contract with the KR, where the Danish division begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a great deal of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with a few members of the B division and will probably change before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with the KR."
Then he says that he probably has to take a wage reduction in Denmark.
“Councils in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
The Bjartmar Wheelchair has recovered for millions of bicycles - now answers for itself after DV survey
For about a year, Bjartmar Leosson has been interested in things different from most others.
He rides forth, and rescues the lost and the stolen horsemen, the chariots, and the horsemen.
Bjartmar has won the name "wheeldriver" for the week.
Yesterday, so much money came up when you gave a story of your relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then pointed out in a Facebook discussion of a group of Western Prayers, which revealed that Bjartmar had taken the man to the East Valley and said that the evening could be stolen.
The original writings of the electrician could only be read that Bjartmar had stolen him.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the predictions of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the initial news of the matter is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday in the East Valley.
Bjartmar reportedly received information from the victim of an electric shock.
That information was damaged by others, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy, and I met him at the shooting, finally with information that there was a power gun that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for.
I hesitated for the first time, but when I saw him preparing to drive away from the fire, I decided to go and talk to the man.
The owner was convinced of his fault, so I decided to talk to the man.
In general, I'm doing very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I said, the man had taken away from me."
Bjartmar says that the man at the power station had just asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called the police.
"Yes, fine," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
So the owners of the power plant proved ownership of their power plant and did not go away.
Later, his story on Facebook was told by the right owner, as it was reported in the preceding article.
In this bedtime year, Bjartmar says that he can count the changes he has made to people on one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in the Republic of Reykjavik," Bjartmar said, pointing out that the riders are the youngest brothers and sisters of society, drug addicts, mentally handicapped people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“The drug is hard to control and somehow the next dose needs to be budgeted, because the theft of such freelance is easy to achieve,” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I’ve come with a lot of the good people with me.
For example, people have gone to treatment and have come to me and look for me and help me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with riders is based on courtesy notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and are happy to offer to show him receipts, tire numbers, and so forth.
The theft of a bicycle is a major problem that has little been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even more likely to tell people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is opposed to the earlier news transmission of DV and is said to be not a self - employed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet come to the neck with his behavior, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly.
“Of course, the police have to do this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I've got to look up at cops driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's purely said rudely in these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything about it, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this group, why not?” Bjartmar asks.
He says that he has achieved so much success in riding on stolen wheels, that he sometimes picks up his “defenders ” on the street, that they only have exactly the brighter wheels they had before.
The times that Bjartmar has called for help from the police have caused her to miss out.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not me teaching, and it’s not the owners of the bikes teaching, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s a pity that a victim of the wheeled thief has to suffer from the emptiness of the police in this case class.
Bjartmar's success is not shared.
In addition, stories can be found by people who thank Bjartmari for having regained their possessions.
Bjartmar himself says that for a long time he has lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the lifts run to millions, if not tens of millions.
There are heavy electric shocks, electric currents, and electric shocks, but electric currents can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works at a school every day, and every other weekend he works at a gathering.
Therefore, his ride is the unpaid work he does in his leisure activities.
Life - giving Treasures and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great anniversary in the history of life-saving treasures in Iceland.
Of course, officials had been granted a rebate from the King of Denmark all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 an official life insurance fund was set up that eventually led to the death of all public officials.
The current general wage - wage fund was then set up with a full - time labor market agreement in 1969, where employment - related wage funds were accepted with a duty source and a complete collection of marine resources since the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were laid on the basis of these agreements, and the life - threatening system continued to deteriorate.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement brought about by its carnival struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly achieved in the historic operations of 1955, and the organizations had gradually been brought together to meet their demands on health and health rights, major weather conditions, reduced working time, improvements in household affairs, and more as a matter of urgency.
All these rights cost a great deal of struggle, but they proved to be much more thoughtful and sustainable than the increase in gold in the wage gap, which disappeared as hard as the wave of the postwar outbreak, which marked the period of war until 1990 as many remember.
The attraction that the establishment of general life - saving gold in 1969 was both long and complex.
Even though people finally agree that the sailors would actually be sailors, the international effort had to fail to ensure that their governments were organized by representatives of trade unions and sailors alike.
In the years that followed the establishment of the seas, the demand for a majority of the workers in the sea administration often came to the attention of employees in the organizations, but it never got to the point of going, so we still have an unusual order that the representatives of seafaring societies are not in the majority of the sea administration.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the Security of Life and the Functioning of Life Assets refers to the financial policies of the Seas.
The number 1 states that “lifeboats should have the advantage of sailing companies to guide them. ”
In the fifth issue of this magazine, we also read: “The moral standard of life must be set in financial institutions. ”
For the Lifeboat Traders Party, the following provisions, inter alia, continue with the above-mentioned legislation:
The Marine Corps is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible financial assets, along with many of the largest marine and professional assets in Western Europe and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance, can help to improve the financial performance of securities.
This brings together the interests of the community and the goals of society in a broader sense.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered on the partial market, take a public policy: to maintain good governance in the social and environmental spheres.
The Sea of Life of Gildi, with the largest sea of the country, has set itself “a policy for responsible investments, ” and there are similar rules.
This is all reflected here as an entry to the newest word of Icelandic, “shade control. ”
Since this is a new issue, it is not the hope that it has been defined lightly, but I see the following definition now being “the most accepted”: Shadow management is when a leader in a community tells the media that he is going to send representatives of the society to the management of the lifeguard order or order on how they should take a stand in a particular case.
If they fail to comply, they will be removed from the administration at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about accountability, however, it is not “shade management” at all, of course, such communication between people in the financial sector as elsewhere.
I let the reader reflect on the way he feels “more shadowy. ”
In particular, there are two people who have tried to receive this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
These are Hörd Ogisson, a journalist in the Newspaper, and Asgeir Jonsson, a bank official.
The reason for both of them was that Bochi Nils Bogason, head of Icelandair, had announced his intention to break the company's agreements with airmen and airmen (toss them), and Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Business Association, had sent them the invitation to the company's representative in the management of the Life Trade Union to support the possible purchase of the company's shares, or they might be dismissed.
Some time later, the Book of Nils withdrew his decision, and in time, Ragnar Thor followed in the same direction as he directed, of course, his decision.
Nevertheless, they saw the reason why Hörd and Ásgeir had to discuss the matter in the February issue of The Watchtower with strong words about shadow management, lawbreak, and the need for changes in laws.
Although the blessed shark had been in contact and had also been quickly dried up, there was no doubt a small dormitory.
In view of the importance of the matter, let us consider the matter ourselves.
I've been here before to those things in the laws on lifeguards that are obedient to this matter.
They include that the sailor must be careful about the interests of sailors and have a moral standard in financial institutions, and these matters are published in more detail in the agreement of both Gildis and the Lifeboat traders, as I mentioned.
However, life-saving treasures should NOT be seen only at the dose range of their financial assets.
Such a course would be dangerous and would not have to be long in looking for examples of such things in the past, since large bank and seabed loans have led to immoral adventures and environmental pollution, with disastrous consequences.
The president of Icelandair was evidently on his neck when he thought of drying out a whole group of workers, thus greatly depriving the welfare of the company of the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward the taxpayers.
Rather, he saw himself and drew it back.
Time shows whether it is possible for a life - saving treasure to be held accountable for marine societies when they arise.

One of the infected did not conduct a homeward survey
One of the three founding Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from Austria on 15 July last, about one and a half weeks ago.
However, he is an Icelandic who is not resident here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions on conducting so - called home Bible studies after coming to the country and going to another exhibition a few days after coming.
He got negative from the scan at the border.
"But he's in an Icelandic society and he's actually going to go into it," says Kamilla Josephs daughter, a specialist in the field of sociology at the University of Landscape and the position of a sociologist while he's on vacation, in consultation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English form of registration and there is no need to record the number of registrations and if the number of registrations is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second exhibition.”
She says that the man could have used the English form of registration because he is actually a resident of a foreign country but because of his connections in the country that the Icelandicman would rather have used it as an Icelandic.
However, he did not realize it.
“ When the pennital is not recorded, you need to look for it yourself at the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ It is clear that we need to improve the information about this while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, although the Icelandic do not record their teaching.
Or do it some way more clearly who are participants in an Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
What is better, though, is that the person concerned will receive a return to the country, although he is defined as a participant in an Icelandic society, a resident of Iceland.
Only six had been sent to the police station since yesterday, and those six were all in contact with him.
They are to be sampled, but two of them are still showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man was denied his visa at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla probably said that he had recently been infected with the virus that he had not yet been able to detect when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the man from being infected here in Iceland but does not carry the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to assume that this is certainly an infection because it has been long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused little damage to the sports competition. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely how much you get around here.
“ It’s really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but notes that it can’t be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the virus in man.
“If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he has moved it to the country.”
Pipe sprays and blasts against countermeasurers
There was a conflict between the police and the protestant in Seattle last night.
The police used the countermeasures of piper sprays and unimaginable hand grenades, but the countermeasurers broke down and turned on.
45 protesters were arrested, and 21 police officers were killed.
Police violence and racial violence were widely protested in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestant was shot to death.
After the BBC report, the attacker has been arrested.
At Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building site and broke down a building in the city’s courthouse.
The police later said that the protests were unwarranted, and there was a conflict between the opposition and the police.
To demand justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by the police in August of the last year, was remembered by Protestants.
There was a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was killed.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of members of the Black National Guard met and demanded justice for Breonne Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by the police in her home in March of the last time.
The group carried a gun and went to closed - doors meetings, where the police separated the group from the group of people who opposed the protests and also carried a gun.
There were 75 prisoners in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants mentioned James Skurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
Sunrise: Not the game that defines our time
Ole Gunnar Solskjör, associate manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the play at Leicester today in the final journey of the English Selection Department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end the Sunshine and his men in 5th and lose them by the Master's Division Seat.
However, they should still hope to join the Master’s Department by working for the next month.
“We haven’t come alone.
If we get to the point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad time now," Solskjör said.
"But whatever happens then is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot in the country by getting the teams two ahead of us," Solskjär said.
Clearly, people’s nerves are going to be about 15 o’clock today, but Solskyr tried to pretend that each other was playing.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being pressured in the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and it's based on the company.
We have created a great opportunity for the end of this period and now it is ours to enjoy it," Solskjör said.
“ This isn’t the most important game of the period, it’s just the next one.
You can ask anyone who's in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our time, we have already had many times to define this time period."
"Come on, Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I think that we are in a better shape and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period," Solskjör said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coroner virus infections were detected in the United States yesterday at John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western sea since the beginning of the Middle Ages in the country.
900 were killed by the virus yesterday than the last four days until the virus killed more than 1,000 people a day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the U.S. Supreme Council, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 in August 15th.
Fear of the World’s Other Waves
The government in Spain is now trying to recover from the increasing prevalence of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Friday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May, and the news is coming at the same time as the Spanish are starting to remove one of the most difficult exits in Europe.
The backlog meant that the British authorities now had to take passengers from Spain to travel on their way home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the list of Britain’s safe states.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have set broader limits to try to stifle growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks and old houses will be closed at midnight.
Then there is now a ban on exit for 200 thousand people in the Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Breta’s decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is heavily dependent on the arrival of foreign travelers and is playing a bad role after the age.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Worldwide, governments have been preparing themselves for the second wave of the world, but little interest seems to be in taking back to a large scale of out - of - date ban that has ruined the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very bad view of this and is like a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, President-in-Office of France, has then said that the nation “will not be able to survive, economically or socially, if it is caught up again to an exit ban in the country.
It is hoped that many local councillors will be able to reinstate the virus in the next round if it comes to the inhabitants of a particular city, city, or region.
Five New Infections in Iceland — Three Inland
Three internal infections were detected yesterday in addition to two additional infections at the border.
In this way, five people with positive Covid-19 infection were found yesterday in Iceland.
The public health report says that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football club.
He had been sent to solitary confinement for 16 who were in close association with him for 19 years.
The person infected was a member of a sports company in Reykjavík and is reportedly “only part of the sport’s content” in sports.
Others who were sent there are related to man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is undetected and full-time smearing by the State Police Department.
The opponents of the ReyCUP convention have followed the guidance and rules of the sociologist and the public who are still in use and have taken appropriate measures.
However, images of the convention were awakened yesterday, as it was possible in close association to celebrate the good conduct of his team outside the field.
Just before 11: 00 a.m. today, opposers published the following Facebook page.
It says: “ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors take their own daughter to school.
Parents are NOT authorized to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported earlier.
The report states: “Island’s genetic analysis has identified the infection and has identified a new type of virus that has not been identified in the past. ”
The work is also being done in this area, and the infection was isolated and 12 was caused by the infection.
The third infection reported by a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It was discovered on the southwestern corner of the country.
Now he is in solitary confinement and six who were in close association with him for 40 years.
Two of them are already showing symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and the results of further studies were expected, such as a mechanism for bordering infections.
Finally, the report states: The Department of Public Health of the National Police and the Office of the National Public Health Officer advises people to be careful and to think carefully about personal antimicrobials.
The slightest doubt about the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus is the same request to take a sample at the next healthcare facility.
Patrexfärd says the tent area is booked for commercial holidays - Direct guests
The tent area of Patreksfard is completed during the weekend, according to the West Bank announcement.
If guests are asked to look at other guest activities.
Its names are Bildudal West Building, Talknafjord, Melanes on Red Sea, Hotel Flokalund, and Hotel Breedavík as the second option in the station.
It is enough to be at Patrek’s Festival this weekend, for as in the previous year, the festival of Iceland’s statues will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong haven in the city.
An application to judge the tent area may be expected at a good meeting this year, if weather does not strike, but DV said earlier today from the following prophecy.
However, we can expect the worst weather south, and hope for the Patrices.
The Web site bb.is said first of all, and said that all other guests in the city were already completed.
The whole multi-story cave in the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18-20.
During the process of obtaining ownership of the building permits for refurbishment, their maturity has grown in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, largest, and most expensive cities in the city of Reykjavik, on the other hand, there are three mansion houses.
At the height of the house there is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two steps, each of which preserves four somewhat comfortable apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a rich history to keep.
It was built in 1959, including video games, the School of Milk, the dairy shop, the Jóa gun, the fishing shop, and now the latest Háskolaprent.
The house is so light as to speak, it is so beautiful as a fool's memory.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
D18h. is owned by a company file, among others Magnus Magnusson and the daughter of God - fearing Helga Larus.
Magnus went to the town of Burgundy and was a defender of the Burgundy holding company.
In the group of owners of the Corporation's holding company, Steelship ehf.
Steel ship e.g. is the foundation company of the Holy Virgin and her children.
Godrun is also the owner of a three-dimensional component of D18 ehf.
A God - fearing man and her husband, August God - fearing son of Sychar, once sailed a steel ship.
The D18 purchased the house in the summer of 2009 and has little to do with it since then.
Tell the neighbors that the house’s condition has steadily deteriorated since then, most recently.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house has “not been particularly vital last year”.
It may play a role in changing the house and the land for a few years.
Other neighbors say the house has been gone for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something common to this patch and to make it so attractive. ”
He also says that he is full of the house because he has not been able to complete it, find some common tape with his neighbors, and stop this “legislative act. ”
"Just do this in agreement with society around so that you can go through this and finish it."
The "Policy" which the householder refers to is the organisational process of the campaign that has been in progress since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then used to build a height above the current and behind the house, a new elevator, and a one - height reconstruction.
The building permit granted for the implementation was claimed to the Committee on the Environment and Materials Committee and dropped it from a value where the implementation was not based on a divisional order and verification was not sufficient.
Then, the city of Smokeyakur left with a divisional work and ended with an announcement in the July Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses last year.
The organisation was also recognised and it fell from its value in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years after the initial application for the building permit and the owner of the house were on the ground floor.
At that time, the house had fallen down numerous times, and the neighbors were tired.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the neighbor’s reaction, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the house owner, others not at all.
Others turned their anger to the city, not to the city.
Others were just angry, but nothing was finally going on.
Others said three - wheeled vehicles, but the neighbors have used the unmanned Dunhaga 18-20 vehicle under their vehicle.
One plaintiff in the case said long-term fatigue in the administration:
“It’s amazing that we have to go through the three-way process.
It's like Reykjavik city couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and in vain.
Memories of the city’s unprecedented government and generous plans for its owners and many years of work are now under way.
When a newspaperman was sitting in the garden of Dunhaga 18, he was struck by a broken door and a trash can.
Playstation computers and a recent TV were in another garbage dump on the earth — a victim of Icelandic summer berry.
It was opened in the old office of Háskolaprent, where many of the cats of the pancreas are to be judged.
Clearly, someone has crept into one corner, but no one is visible.
A stack of beds and beds and a few sheets of earth’s pages, probably to be taken to a book, blew up.
The steps of the apartment were also open to both.
The newspaper man was so lucky to pick up their fellow residents.
There the Romans were swimming potatoes in the evening and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians are working for the Ztrongforce ehf company.
They have been there for some time, and DV authorities have said that the company has paid nothing for the household except heat and electricity.
Because of the house’s condition, it is not considered necessary to obtain a rental.
From post office positions in the front door of the house, it is obvious that there have been some foreign workers in recent times.
The growth of workers has not been a reflection of the Covid-19 state, but a trend in travel towards a contract in the building agency, and these two industries have been what they are capable of exploiting the service of workers.
Nevertheless, the Danhaga 18 homeowners seem to have enough work to do, and the workers and the workers in the same land stopped until after a long day’s work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment seemed to be well maintained by the children.
When a newspaperman greeted the boys with a Romanian accent, he suddenly became aware of the mystery: The best place in Reykjavik is a 1,500 - square - foot [1,500 m] estate.
Owners want to change the house for improvement, and neighbors want to improve the state, but share the definition of "repair".
Between the city’s organizational area and its start-up, the victims of endless recruitment routes and opportunities in the organization’s process and the similar solutions of the Committee on the Environment and Humanities.
So Romanian workers live in the house, perhaps those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17 issue of The Watchtower.
In an attack against weight loss following the age of coronation virus
Britain’s President Boris Johnson will pay £10 million in a military campaign against overweight, which will, among other things, be banned from instantaneous advertisements, following his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
While Johnson is aware of the campaign that has been promised better health, tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign will encourage doctors to prescribe bicycles for their subjects in excess of weight and will also be confronted with increased bicycle rides.
Then the announcements on television will be banned before 21 p.m., according to British media sources.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the President-in-Office is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food," said a spokesman for the government.
Johnson himself has a problem with weight, but he was put into custody when he was infected by the coronary virus in ours, and it's partly his weight because he's considered to have been so seriously weakened.
A woman better to cope with changes
She said that the new governing body would be the greatest step that the nation could take in the pursuit of greater power, prosperity, and anticorruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change things a little now and who is better able to make such changes than the group of society that has easier to be in these terms.
There are women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their composition.
To stand together and make changes.
So now we have just come to lead these changes."
She said she was a bit emphatic about Iceland’s emphasis on “best in the world ” in both gender and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as ready to see what needs to be done.
Like Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything they need to do.
It's a slope.
We need to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the grounded groups.
We don't live by the same rules here," Helga said.
She asked them to be good - looking women in Iceland in many ways, but she added that like elsewhere, Icelandics were built with enormous male value.
She said that politics was turning to self - rule, power, and power that were the power that maintained injustice in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and have only become somewhat curious that Alting is going to move beyond this 2012 nationwide award," she said.
“ It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she added, adding that the values mentioned above were fundamental in the new governance register.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can switch otherwise," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that pilots and nurses have to stand in an endless battle just to get human pay."

Trying to rob a roadwalker in the middle of a city
One was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened the roadwalker and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Arbej, where two were arrested for the matter.
At that time, the police stopped the motorbike driver in the Guards, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km at a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
Moreover, he had been like a driver.
The police in the capital had enough to turn the night, and nearly 80 cases were recorded in a police diary from five to five yesterday morning.
At that time, there was a great deal of noise reports due to compliance.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven loud noises were made, and it became widely available in a police journal.

However, they had just escaped when a police officer was in a park.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for computers and drugs.
Four of them were arrested for beatings in the middle of the night, but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency meeting after they fell on their faces, one in the middle and the other in the west.
One was moved to an accident building after he failed to jump to the trampoline in Kopavoga.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a bicycle home in Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to a police journal, the bicycle equipment of the house was in “very bad condition” and was suspended.
Can you stay at Monet's house about the business man's health?
The house in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years in his work is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next loose night in the house is about the merchant's saint.
The house is small and compact, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
From 1883 until his death in 1926, the painter lived in the house.
In the house are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his garden famous in this house.
If someone is planning to rent the house, he must rent it at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, it is next released after a week, on the Sunday of the marketing man’s sanctuary, and therefore may be used for some traders on vacation to book the painter’s house.
The two nights of business holidays cost only 964 U.S. dollars, or just over 130 thousand Icelandic crowns, as the Newspaper reports.
Sickness and some of them start to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronary virus
Five have been diagnosed with internal corona virus in the last three days, and most of the infected are uninfected.
Tights have been found for this reason, and some of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with internal corona virus yesterday and two at border inspection.
A specialist at the office of the country doctor says that an increasing number of internal infections do not ultimately mean that the virus is spreading across society.
“ The first internal survey has been reported, and there is a virus that has not been seen before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigrid Joseph daughter, a specialist in the field of sociology of an official veterinarian.
Most of them have been infected with people who came from abroad.
More sampling is taking place next than some who were associated with those infected are showing the symptoms of the coronary virus.
“Now there is no flu and less of other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat free by doing these tests on individuals who at the time of influenza had found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Smashing is mostly completed but is not excluded that more have to go into captivity.
Two of the infected were diagnosed with a history of sports.
If so, questions have arisen about whether it is proper to hold such an event.
The public liaison officer says that it is very easy for people to follow guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says that the infected have almost been infected with sports events.
“ If these individuals are not more isolated from each other after attending these sports events, we can conclude that our associates at the parties have worked.
But it is not found," said Camilla.
The public safety department’s work is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or limitations if there seems to be a reason," Kamilla said.
After a week’s sleep, the number limit is set for thousands of people.

"Secure meditation to cook" - See Elisha Weather's menu
Elisha’s daughter - in - law is an aphrodite, playing with Val.
She is also the master of nutrition, mother, and nutrition.
It takes great energy for the dawn of the day, and it often gives itself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day begins to come up to work out of eight," says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I get my girl to school at three o’clock.”
Elisha is very pleased to have his daughter attend the school early in the morning.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second party.
After exercise, it’s good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good to look at one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting her hands on a master’s degree in nutrition, and she knows what it takes to eat enough energy to do her job, school, family, and exercise.
“ What’s good for me is to eat a variety of foods that are well made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food as bad or good, rather than as nourishing or undernourished.
It's quite all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I find certain thoughts in standing in the kitchen burning and getting very much into it.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I'm a good cook."

Conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle
A civil authority in Seattle, Washington, D.C., described a rebellion following numerous protests in the city.
Yesterday, police caught up with bomb blasts and pipers to try to wipe out large areas of the city’s palace, which were exposed by opposers and stretched over many of the houses near the mayor’s house.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that a study of the damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb, was being conducted.
According to the city and police authorities, opposers have found police with stones, bottles, blasts, and other solubles, and one police officer was transferred to the hospital where his injuries were caused.
Yet, the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The wind was for them to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, but there has been a severe conflict between Protestants and heavily armed U.S. police forces in the city.
Where, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under the banners of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands an additional.
Do not cancel until after refund
Whether or not their flight schedules for Icelandair, which should be scheduled for the next month's meeting, will be cancelled.
The Icelandic Air carrier’s Flying Flying Credits agreement with Icelandair closes at noon tomorrow.
Liany Johns daughter of the president of the Society is certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the outcome of the resolution is reached.
“ This is clearly intertwined, ” says The League of Goddess.
“ There has been no setbacks, this must go before the machines can be man - made.
Of course, people are anxious to know if there will be work to be done after the month's meeting."
The contract was signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously entered into by airmen.
On July 17th, the government and the Trust Council of the Icelandic Air Force approved the announcement of a full - time military service facility in Icelandair, which was approved by the members of the company in an agreement.
It never came to her, but this was determined by Icelandair’s decision to terminate consultations with the airline, to cancel all its flights, and to seek agreements with another airline.
At that time, the airline’s pilots were required to take on temporary safety duties.
Asking how she feels that the pension will go, the Law of God says that it is difficult to say.
“People are in pain after this operation of Icelandair, when all the airline pilots were announced and reported to be in contact with another airline.
Now it will find out if it has any effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots worked in Icelandair, but then 900 of them, by 95%, were fired.
Their reckoning is long, with them that have the lowest degree, when he shall have three months, and when he shall have ended the feast of the month of July.
There are about 90% of Icelandair pilots in that group.
What will we accept if the agreement is not approved?
“ Then we would like to have further discussions with our relatives.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots have probably gone too far."
Statutory clearance final and Icelandair will report another quarter tomorrow
Air fare adjustment for a new landing will close at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
Set up Icelandair for another quarter of the year will also be published in the morning, but emergency emergency response results indicate that the company’s intake has decreased by 85 percent from the same period of time earlier.
An agreement on the agreement between the Icelandic Air Force and the Working Group for Icelandair started on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 p.m. on noon.
Those eligible for the contract are staff members of Icelandair who pay for the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new agreement on Sunday’s night of action on Sunday, July 19th, before Friday, Icelandair had reached a meeting with the company after the pilots had dropped the first contract in an agreement at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the pilots and the airlines of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new charter was signed.
According to a new charter, pilots need to fly more than five hours a month before the same basic salary.
The charter is for 2025, but it has been agreed upon by the air traffic controllers and the duration of the flight.
The agreement was introduced to FII’s associates at Hilton Nordica’s hotel last Monday, and many airmen who were interviewed by the news office were unhappy about the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that it would be necessary to accept the agreement to keep FIA alive.
For another quarter of the year, Icelandair will be known tomorrow as the company's EBIT, its registrant power of financial resources and taxes, according to emergency emergency extraterrestrials negatives of 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic kronas.
Icelandair sent Buyhöllen emergency calculations last Wednesday, where the company’s acquisitions amounted to about $60 million per quarter or about $8.3 billion.
Handmade money and its equivalent amounted to about $154 million at the end of the quarter, about $21 billion.
Icelanders also aim to offer the company’s share in August.
Icelandair intends to conclude agreements with fifteen Länder, the government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month prior to the partial delivery.
New Diff More Than New Virus Type
“The new virus simply means that it has been a person from abroad.
This is not something that has been grounded here internally," says Már Kristjansson, chief physician of the Landspital Hospital Hospital Hospital, who reports that the “new type of virus” has been identified here in the country.
Three internal injuries were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was found to have been involved in the sports community’s work at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection was undetected and there was a shortage.
In the case of an individual who came to the country on July 15, there were also two people who were in contact with him started to show signs of COVID–19.
Yesterday’s infection related to the infection reported on the previous day and after an analysis of the Íslenski genetic analysis was identified as “a new type of virus that has not been identified previously. ”
Smashing is done in connection with the infection.
Mam notes that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new SARS-COV-2 coronal virus.
It is better to talk about a new deviation from the virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of the world, Mar says that as there is a case in point, it could go away so that nothing else will be left of it.
“However, if domestic cases that are not related to a foreign country and are of the same genotype as this particular deviation could be concluded [after the second wave] but it is not time to support them," explains Mar.
Happy in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelandics hidden in the hotpots?
Journalists of the BBC are thus likely to have a fun video that sheds light on the country’s bathing and hot-potping process.
The Icelandic bathing population is unique in the world, and it is claimed that there are as many bathing areas in the world.
The natural earthquake is the basis for it, but it also has to do with the healing that is here.
Children’s education was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are still able to use their water for health reasons.
Swallowing is described as a permanent part of the country’s general well - being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of position.
Without mobile phones, people talk to each other on personal notes about the home and the space or use the similar power of water: thinking and loading the energy of the soul and body.
The flag to pick up a hundred days in the election
Hundreds of days have passed since the U.S. election and the election of presidents to four years of age.
Donald Trump is looking for a retrieval, but he still has to get the flag.
Joe Biden, the likely promoter of the Democratic Group, has been greatly ahead of Trump in the country, being targeted by the polls.
According to a recent AP survey, the United States estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to the new coroner’s virus is very unpopular, and more Americans than before the president took a bad view of economic matters.
Nearly two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32% say they support Trump’s response because of his age and 48% say he’s been good at economics.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
Based on the mean FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 per cent countrywide and Trump is 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his attitude toward his age, to Biden, to the so - called cultural divisions, and to a policy that should be governed by laws and regulations.
However, Biden’s offer makes a great deal of effort to keep Trump in mind, and it is likely that if the election is actually about how Trump has been in work for the past four years, he will win.
Unfavorable Trump also seems to be coming down on the members of the Republican Group, and the Democrats fear that even a majority of the U.S. elders, who have done so, could be reached.
Politico said that in those days to keep the company of groups and suppliers comparable, and it is now that the Republican group would get its most out of it for decades.
The environment has proved particularly bad for the group in the 2016 elections and is now looking to continue its development.
In the past, Trump has tried to scare the environment into following him, including by saying that he will become President Biden, he will destroy the United States environment and promote racial divisions.
For example, Trump has dropped regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of environments.
Then he encouraged the U.S. environment to read articles from former Assistant Prime Minister New York, since she believed Biden would destroy the U.S. environment and took Trump under it.
“Prayer will destroy you and your American dreams.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the president.
In the United States, there is an increasing number of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reappointed in 2004, the majority of the members of this group have been appointed president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The reviews have shown that despite Trump’s assurances, almost a major part of the 2016 environment has been significantly reduced by its follow-up.
Although there is a difference between knowledge and knowledge, Biden has been recommended with about fifteen percent advances in Trump’s previous careers.

Will the Olympics be lighted at the end of the march?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that have only led to World War II, the president of the International Olympics Council said that the Olympics would be “lighted at the end of the march, ” and there it was expected to point out in a global case of a corona virus that the world building is now walking through.
In addition, there is an additional year to prepare, and the authorities in Japan add to the cost of the delay.
Everyone, however, has a lot to do with their heads.
When it was reported that Tokyo, Japan, became the site of the Olympics this year, the joy of the Japanese delegates was inevitable.
They cried and laughed in return, and finally Tokyo had decided to hold the 2016 game, but it changed into a lower hold for Rio, Brazil.
In this regard, Tokyo City and Japan should take a bath at the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, starting with July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If you fail to keep the games, if the coroner virus is still too threatened, the game will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think about it.
Olympics are no ordinary sports games.
Nothing to save, the display should always be great and try to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on an assessment of the city’s announcements.
The more brilliant the presentation is — the more likely it is to receive the bribe.
Tokyo was worth $150 million in trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, which amounted to nearly $20 billion.
For the second time, when the game was launched in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, were placed in the release.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to win the game this year, the Japanese authorities had to pay 30 billion dollars for the project.
However, that amount is only a drop in the sea according to what it costs to build an Olympic village, a playground, and in general to strengthen the country’s enthusiasm for such an event, to prepare it, and to hold the games themselves.
Japan’s organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be in progress these days but have been delayed for about one year because of the coronary virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government official in Japan who came out at the end of the last year showed that the cost was nearly double that.
It may not be possible to fully assess the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost of Japanese Olympics and Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
So high are the numbers that all taxes paid by the Icelandic government amounted to only about half of the Olympics, at the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are events of the magnitude that they have preferred to become the subject of fortune - tellers who try to ruin numbers and consider the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, many seem to have found that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities holding them.
Dosage effects are some, for example, very many jobs in a short time, but for a longer time, cities prefer to sit up with debt traps and fear - inspiring recreating costs of little used human activity.
Río, Brazil, is heavily indebted to the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major sports activities that were built for the games.
According to the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who won the Olympics were previously unemployed.
This means that it was not a new job but a small one.
In general, cities have not been particularly well off financially holding the Olympics because of the similar cost of the human activities that are based on the games.
The advantage, however, is that the increased travel of travelers who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which is very uncertain about the 2021s.
It is also unclear whether it is possible to accept all the spectators who usually attend the games.
However, the main thing is the honor that the cities deserve to be given, but it is difficult to appreciate money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy of the games is not the norm.
Of course, this is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that's in the foreground.
For some Africans, it is surprising that it is just a matter of delaying the games.
For example, the Australian five - foot - long [5 m] gold sea and its gold - gold harbor, Chloe Esposito, have been a cassole who had been far away for the summer, hoping to win the 2021.
Thus, she is among the athletes who are only rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For athletes who planned to quit after the game this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning that in some cases they would stop the game before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of hard work.
Several athletes came to the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympics in Rio and Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has had some interviews in his home country in the United States before to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not absolutely sure she'll be at the top of the game next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be of age, it is generally higher for a movie wife in the first place.
“This is sensitive,” says Biles, but smiling at another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympics, asked whether she was going to reach the 2021s as well as she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a whole year in addition to exercises,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not suffer from the stress associated with exercise much longer.
Nonetheless, she is a champion of the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to stop practicing suddenly when the world situation was at its peak and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exceptions to Biles more than others while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympics could not afford any more access than the others; she needed to find ways to keep herself in the shape of others.
The basics are certainly better than those of most people.
“We have a firm plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing again first after the movie hall opened.
We started slowly, but we are on our way back to the full - time ministry, and I will continue to increase as much as I can during the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we do know that they will be.
I've put too much into leaving the game now," says Biles.
Like other blind doubters, she may be more aware of the possibility that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
However, predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coroner’s world virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else will be done except to prepare for the Olympics, given that they will be held annually.
Maybe the Olympics will be lighted at the end of the Covid march.
Delayed wedding due to adultery
Modern Family Actor Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronation virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette to the contender Wells Adams this summer.
"I think it's other important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with the People.
“ We finally want to get married sometime and have a dream wedding and have all the people we love.
However, we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now and it is helping to share information about the importance of being in need and staying at home.
I'm looking at a lot more than a wedding anniversary these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus on what's going on in the world."
