Members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they "seem like muppets"
Part of the members of the Assembly are laughed at by their proposal to be changed to the "CPU" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is prompted by plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales Assembly.
The members of the entire political spectrum are worried that this could be a cause for laughter.
One of the Labourers said his group was upset because the new name is "Rome with Tup and Vdlub."
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group "is not pre-convinced" to change the name, but notes that the new name CHP (MWP) has a certain verbal opportunity with "mopet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drawing up the draft law by which the name should be changed, made the following statement: "It is clear that the final decision for all descriptive names, which are called members of the Assembly, will belong to the members themselves".
The Wells Government Act 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public inquiry into the proposals establishing broad support for the Assembly to start to be called the Wells Parliament.
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "Members of the Wells Parliament, briefly "CPU", but the option "CPU" has been given the greatest support after questioning the public.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill for amendment to a few weeks.
The Reform Bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of its members, as well as the very design of the commission system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they arrive at the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a continuing dispute for decades with neighboring Greece, where it has an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the country's name change, said he would not start the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name of the country is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are closing in the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at a historical plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today both are gone."
Adams shares that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"Today's people are socializing in different ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the quarterlys where everyone gathers regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position".
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people who do not help survive the rest of the shrines of the neighborhood live.
"The vast majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built of white pastures before Harlem became a quarter of the Blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist paste was introduced in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of the black inhabitants of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was a poem by black Christians under the leadership of the distinguished John Howard Johnson, who organized the boycott against retailers on the 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black-skinned employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire defeats, but Father Johnson's parishioners set up a plan for her restoration, where the bells were ordered.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called them "poor bells".
The expert who used the campaigns in July has another description: "Cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical instrument".
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that this is the first system of campaigns in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the church Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywooder says that St. Martin's has not been replaced.
What was played in "St. Martin" over the past few weeks has been a complex story, filled with architects and performers, some led by the world leaders of the church, and others by the Episcopal Epicurean.
From the newspaper – which is the head office of the pastor, made up of the world leaders – they wrote to the parish in July expressing their concerns that the parish "would be inclined to transfer the expenses of the parish", although it did not have a role in hiring the architects and performers sent by the parish.
Some jurors have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the epariah.
13-year-old child injured by shark in a lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it suffocated for lobsters in California on the first day of the fishing season, the authorities reported.
The attack happened just 7 mornings ago near the Beach of Biconn in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego, that he snorted with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and went in with the whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, after which he realized how he was shouting: “I am so touched!
He's arresting me!"
Hamle shares that when he got to the boy, he found out that the whole area of his key was broken.
"I've called everyone out of the water because there's a shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Gilles made a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier in the water there was a spotted shark, but it was estimated that it was not of a dangerous kind.
Gilles adds that the victim has suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his body.
The authorities have closed access to the beach line from Ponto Beach in Kazablad to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is under way.
Gilles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the UK market for ornamental products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening standards for decorative products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive on the market for ornamental products in the UK, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, the biggest so far auctions for ornamental products will be located in 11 stores across the country, then, if such an initiative succeeds, will be discovered in more facilities.
The investment curve in the decorative sector is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stables, which is soon occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury, they said they would double the number of products to 3000, for the first time including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more place like the offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also releases its bottle range of creams again, so most products can be used by giants – something that is increasingly looking for by younger consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first one he opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Marketing online and shifting focus on the marketing of smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times leads to the need for supermarkets to make more effort to attract customers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury, shared that the facilities would look more and more like universal stores while the chain of supermarkets is trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl discounts, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have Argos' facilities in hundreds of shops, as well as Habitats' facilities, since they bought both chains two years ago – which they claim from the company has increased sales of food goods and made the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous experience of the supermarket chain to preface its facilities for decorative and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury had a joint experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing the rich range of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the kind and nature of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training for our colleagues who will offer professional advice on-the-spot.
The range of brands proposed by us is designed to respond to all tastes and all necessary in a prison environment with a comfortable location, which makes us an attractive destination for decorative products, which creates a challenge to the very concept of the old way of marketing."
Peter Jones was angry after Holly Willuby's 11 million pounds off the deal.
The Dragons Den Peter Jones star "has become angry", after TV leader Holly Willuby has given up a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willuby doesn't have time for the brand of home appliances and accessories True.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand in Guinean Poltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old leader announced his abandonment at Instagram.
Holly Willuby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to cook", after withdrawing from their business with the brand for lifestyle products in the last minute – focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "has become angry" when the "golden girl" on television admitted during the tense meeting on Tuesday in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckingamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that there will be no time for his brand home products and accessories True.
The business is typical of the Goop brand of Guinette Poltrow, as the rumors are that he doubled Willuby's wealth, the value of which is forecasted at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willuby announced in Instagram his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain by plane to go to one of his holiday properties.
One source said: "Truly was certainly Holly's highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the mess completely unattended.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse in Marlowe that's full of waiting products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader of this morning, which is one of the most successful stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from headlights and candles to clothing and household products, as well as could lead to a slowdown in the launch of the market.
And not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willi, who is the mother of three children, along with her wife, Dan Baldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willuby himself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
Both families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willuby will become a "poster" of the M&S brand and will also replace Ann Mcparlyn as the leader of the broadcast "I'm Famous" on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business."
Serious negotiations leading to "the deepening of relations"
He jokes about the criticisms he would take from the media channels about making a comment that someone would consider "inappropriate to the president" and as too positive for North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump answered in his funny "new" way.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, after the first was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea".
But the negotiations for the elimination of this weapon are on hold.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yung Ho told the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "sees no reciprocity" by the US towards its country's first steps on the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for war with this country.
They were going to kill millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – ending rocket tests, liberating hostages and returning home to the bodies of US soldiers.
He also protected his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter this crowded area, we would have about 200 people right there," said Trump, facing the crowd in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged the island and led to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign non-governmental organizations, it was stated that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unequivocal opinion that international aid is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," says Mrs. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is a team to go to Palau, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The national spokesperson of the disaster agency, Mr. Sutopo, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disaster.
Although refuges have been built in the case of tsunamis in Aceh, they are not often seen on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Soon stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship went to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it can reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia's remaining infrastructure into the centre of his campaign, investing a large number of resources in roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is constantly slowing down his office, while Joko is running his clocks again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Look: Daniel Steridge brought late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday at the "Stampford Bridge" in London.
Steridge got a delivery from Jordan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was left with 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot, then made a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penal field and turned to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plonziral Kepa Arisabalaga and mixed up unscrupulous in the network.
"I tried to take a good position to control the ball because players like Shak are always looking for front positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen the squeezing Kante, I've pushed my ball, and I've just shot without much thought."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star One Azhar.
The attacker of the "saints" handed the fifth to Mateo Kovacic, then printed from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
A coward exchanged a quick double in the center.
Then he released a fast-shooted dog with which he took Azar to a clean position in the penal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and noticed with his left foot in the far corner next to the door of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoleon in the group stage of the Champions League at 3:00 this Wednesday at the "San Paolo" Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be videoton at the UEFA's Europe League at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people have been caught in the midst of the ruins of buildings, collapsed after the earthquake with a magnitude 7.5, which struck the country on Friday and led to waves of up to 20 feet, reports the press conference's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, is populated by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after Mercisside discovered a woman's body this morning at Berkenhead.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the mutilation of Grayson Mouse on John Street, as a 32-year-old man was allegedly arrested for murder.
The police are asking for everyone in the area who's seen or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg all those who have been close to John Street in Burkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with their board cameras, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was discovered was a resident of Berkenhead and that she was found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends who consider the woman to be known came to the scene and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues as the police reported that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse tried to get back to his apartment, but he was informed by the police that nobody was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man remained silent when he understood what had happened.
The residents are informed that hours will pass until they are allowed to return.
One of the police officers told a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She keeps saying, "This is so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police baths passed through the border while another van remained outside.
There are police officers in the border who are watching the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the newest memorial hit through "rewrite history"
Its prohibition will be a poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts, which was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
Ala "The Cromwell Society" described Mr. Crick's proposal as "absolute" and "experience to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The iconography of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph this: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate presentation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person, which is one country of the emerging division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve to be marked and honored."
A pig-killer wounded a deadly Chinese farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, only identified by his family as Juan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near the stallion of the market of Liupanshui in the province of Wayjou, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pigmeat was prepared to inject its pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin from the province of Cinhai, China.
He's supposed to be here with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, as well as locked the door to the next door open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the cock with a bleeding hump.
The forensics have confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reports.
"My cousin's foot was bleeding and deformed," says cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera recording shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The killer was not a member of Juan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It has also been reported that Yuan's family and market management negotiate compensation for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as the man was severely injured after the attack.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig dragged a whale farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to hunt him down.
Having been eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect them as a "slip".
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
But a man must also treat them with respect," the man ends.
Losing Hurricane Rosa will lead to honour and flooding in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa loses weight as she moves above the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a power of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, considered to be 5 hours a week in the morning east time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north this week.
During this time, over the Pacific, a sink that moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the tropical moisture deep north to the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
During the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching sink will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and fast floods, broken streams and likely droughts in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to valleys from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be light floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a sheep in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunderstorms will lead to high dust and stormy winds.
The approaching sink will lead to heavy rains in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach valleys from more than half an inch, which will lead to carrying small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rainy season.
In late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain with them will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone on late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central US.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the Central and Eastern US is expected to have a warm beginning in October, with temperatures expected to exceed about 80 degrees from the south to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanau's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive sight of the testimony of the nominations for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanau and Christine Blaci Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 80s of the 20th century.
During this time, political opposition continued as the networks interrupted their regular return programmes in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau had pressed her drunk and tried to take off her clothes during a gymnastics party.
Kavanau, in her absence of emotional testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing did not happen.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's 20.4 million viewers reported seeing the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no direct data available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
For comparison, we're talking about a audience similar to that of the champion football game or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day hearing, reports Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
Having come out of the office of a moderate republican with a statement that he would vote in Kavanau's support, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday how protesters have turned him on while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During the entire brake for a few minutes, he did not raise his eyes from the ground, which was emitted live on the CNN.
"I'm right here, I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have authority while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake turned down that they had already left his office with a statement, and before closing the elevator doors, he announced that he would speak further during the hearing by the commission.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided a solid coverage of live several hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the attention of the full Senate for the vote.
Ala Flake said he would do this only if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominations next week, for which the Democrats insist on opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator of the Christian Queens Democratic Party.
After talking to Coons and a few Senators, Flek made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanau.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and in undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called "Lady's Game Plan" for Brexit, saying that the collection of customs fees from Britain for the EU and vice versa is "absolute".
Shooting Wade Sims: Police arrest suspect Dean Simpson for the death of a player from LSU
Police are arresting a suspect for the finished fatal shot at Wade Sims, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dean Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and indicted for second-degree murder, reports the Baton Rose Police Department.
Officials presented a video of Sims-Simpson's confrontation, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and also found Simpson's DNA on them, reported by the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police reported that he had admitted the fatal shot against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, reported by the Advocate.
The Eastern Baton Rose Medical Service publishes a preliminary report on Friday, in which a gunshot wound, head and neck were identified as the cause of death.
The management expresses its gratitude to the refugee investigation department of the Luxemburg State Police, the Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents for the aid they have provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic sports director Joe Aleva thanks to the local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 foot and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average last season reached 5.6 points and 2.6 slots in the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach reported that the team was "shrewd" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that "this is something that worries a person all the time".
Volcano sprays ashes over Mexico City
Throwed out by the volcano Popocatepetel ash reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre has warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ashes emissions have been registered in the last 24 hours.
The center's been watching a lot of rabbits and tremors.
Published in social media images show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
The geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the annual independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors of independence met with the Gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first year of the polarising vote to expel Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to muffle the peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually huddle with tourists.
Later in the day, other issues arose with the police, when the police came to their sticks to take control of the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups shouted, "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while they declared to preserve the country's integrity with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence of the region even one year after the 1 October referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catholics.
The vast majority voted whether their vote on independence, although the activity was low, as most of the disengagement opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
Wanting independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined his separatist protest with his wife, says that they no longer hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're standing," the man added.
Despite the significant victory, it was even a small difference in the regional elections last December, which supported the independence of the Catalan political parties experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-defeated detention, or are arrested in anticipation of the process because of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pieug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians and both sides.
His comment is that it is becoming "more and more tense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catholic leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced that he will be running in the European Parliament elections next year.
He claims that "my candidacy for European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Arrested men after the car got stuck in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 respectively, were arrested after a car several times in a house in London.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 a.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that there have been damage both on the gate and on the building itself.
It's also possible on the car to be shot with an arballet.
Menga's goal is to win the Livingston with 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The New Year at the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and put Steven Gerard's second loss in his first 18th match as the manager of the club at Ibrox.
The goal of Dolly Menga is decisive, and Gary Holt's team is balanced on points with the second in the hybrid ranking.
Gerard's team is missing a foreign field in the High League this season, and next week it's facing the Harts leader, from whom it's left with eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers is home to Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone is already in a series of six games without losing in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of loss since he changed the post of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed good opportunities against homeless guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead the results far before they scored the goal, and his direct game style was extremely difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his punch went away, then Alan Litgow shot next to the grid after Craig Halket got the ball back with his head on him.
The hosts left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously complicate the guests from static positions.
And that's how it got to the winner's goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and led Menga, who took his ball and marked it from the middle of the criminal field.
So far, Rangers ruled the ball more, but they faced the unprovoked protection of the hosts, and Porter Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of the game continued even during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' backer saved Scott Pittman with a foot shot, and a hit with Little's head passed by the door after another static situation for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, the centers were used, however, which were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the ass – first after a consensus between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then in doubt of hand-playing.
Livingston’s Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingstone.
The team plays just fine, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo any changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he changed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing the defense in a great way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warle under constant pressure.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, you're being shown some great things, but in the case they were very much under those standards.
They missed the last pass before naked, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss has to wake up Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship cools down due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but, despite this, many supporters were ravaged around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it to the country.
The various protests reflect a break caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time despised as a despot by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Wheelchair resting after a car crash
The driver died after a car crash in London.
The disaster was near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and got medical attention, but the driver died on the spot.
The disaster happened a few months after another driver died, after he was hit by a runaway driver on Children Street, located about a mile from the scene of the Saturday disaster.
The capital police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man and will then notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are turned off, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six supervisors have been injured in lightning
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, reports the Prison Service.
The riot exploded in Long Lartin prison in Worchester at about 09:30 in the morning British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to control it, special servants from the Tordano team are called to deal with eight persons deprived of their liberty, as the only incident in a restricted to one wing of prison.
The injured supervisors have suffered minor personal injuries and have received medical attention on the spot.
A prison official made the following statement: “Excellently trained servants are being challenged, who will face an incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
We tolerate no violence in our prisons and state very clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police, as their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be treated in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
Also in October last year, police officers from the parts of the peace fight were summoned to a prison where they were to have a serious accident in which staff were attacked with billiards.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens with light-watering Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although the dried areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great likelihood that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa carries through the desert in the southwest, leading to a risk of light floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against light floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, in south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Uta, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phinish on Tuesday, as late Monday may bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!”
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Centre for Hurricanes provide for 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as in separate places up to 4 inches of precipitation are possible.
For those who are not threatened by light floods, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently in drought.
According to the US drought monitoring Commission, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second most serious category," says Weather.com.
First, the road of Hurricane Rosa leads to the drought at Baha California, Mexico.
Rose, which can still be praised at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles an hour on Sunday morning, is located at 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and is therefore losing weight.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the drought in Mexico with the strength of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of floods.
"Summary rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to the northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Yuta until Tuesday evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the US desert southwest," the National Centre for Hurricanes warns.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening light floods and different waste streams in the deserts as well as landings in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsummer North: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer North about 04:00 in the morning British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the Radstock area, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested, reported by the police in Avon and Summerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau "has suffered from the humiliation and anger" of the democratic party
"Every voice for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the cowardly and disturbing tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau "has suffered from the humiliation and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Kavanau testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's charge of sexual assault decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and quality" of Kavanau.
"Every voice in support of Judge Kawanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president said before the assembly there were a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly saw Kavanau's nomination as he spoke of the importance of the republican votes for the general elections.
"It leaves five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually also participating," Trump continued.
"That's why I go around and fight in support of the good candidates."
Trump noted that the democrats have set themselves up for a mission "to prevent and impede".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected to take place no later than Friday, as one of the senior representatives of the Republican Party reported to the CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast by giant waves, when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at the ceremony the coast was marked by waves up to six meters (18 feet), led many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so many became victims of the disaster," Soutopo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesia BNPB Disaster Management Agency, announced during a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The water had pulled with it cars, trees, entire houses, defeated everything on its way," Nugroho continued and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h), before hitting the coast.
"Some people have joined the trees and thus managed to escape the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the agency for disaster photos of the air showed buildings and shops destroyed, collapsed and damaged bridges, as well as a water-circulated mosque.
Secondary rabbits continued to hunt the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake sequence was reached in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the release of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb during World War II.
The declaration also states that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, added the speaker, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the rabbit.
He also added that "communications are completely cut and there is no information from Dongala".
The red cross, on the other hand, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers have already headed for the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy now, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was furiously criticised for not informing about the defeated Palu tsunamis, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, loving videos show a man on the top floor of a building that screams at people on the street panic warnings about approaching tsunamis.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall bursts into the shore and treats both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe power failure, which has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the servants of the World Vision from Dongala managed to reach Palu safely, where they found refuge in the rocky slopes scattered in the court of their office, they passed a number of scenes of desertification, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw countless houses destroyed."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and rehabilitation emergency groups, some complain that those who have extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the financing, dispatching of staff and supplies abroad can only begin if the affected place is declared a national disaster zone.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"Security is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a statute."
While over Palu falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Hendon Subandono, the coach of the national paraplannerism team in Indonesia, has trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those captured in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandaghi added.
"As seniors in the field of paraplannerism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Hendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the community on paraplanarism, he was desperate to send messages about WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue marks, however, the only response to his messages was the only grey one.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Stealers raise $26,750 while loading ATMs in Newport Levi
On Friday morning thieves lifted $26,750 from Brink's employee, who loaded a ATM in Newport, Levi, became clear from a press release by the police department in Newport.
The driver of the car has emptied the ATM in the fun complex and has prepared to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man "has approached running behind the back of Brink's servant" and stole the purse with money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but the police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All those who have information on the identity of suspects must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: Rapper changes her name
Rapper Kanie West is changing her name.
Along with the announcement of a change on Twitter Saturday, he also wrote: "The man, officially known as Kanie West".
West, at 41, for some time, wears the Y-tip and is used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He's changing Ariana Grande's song into a show that turned down "for emotional reasons," the creator of the show tells us.
In addition to a reduction in his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word is religious for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where "you" or "you," shared the West earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the ruling Big Boy.
"That's how I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He passed from Kanie, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of good in us, of evil, of confusion, of all things.
The album is rather a reflection of our essence."
The rapper is one of many known in his field that changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of pre-cours and names, including Puff Daddy, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the nickname Lion and Brader Lion.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay Zee, has also introduced himself in an option with or without arrow and/or capital letters in his preface.
Mexico's President swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly-elected Mexican President, Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador, swore that he would never use military force, which happened as the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday of Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopes Obrador promised "never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopes Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. must double the financing of the development of II
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the front of artificial intelligence development, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, says the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government officials made statements on the issue of II, although the U.S. does not have an official II strategy as a whole.
During this time China presented its plan yet last year: the country strives to become number 1 from innovations in II by 2030.
"The duplication of the II development budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far from the United States and are going to make further breakthroughs with respect to II," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the next major achievement in the field of II to come from the US, as Lee informed the CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of II: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies for II in China – Face++.
In the 80s of the last century, Carnegie Melon Lee worked on an II system that won the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google clone.
Lee gives the responsibility of the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Agency's Robotics Competition for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asks when the next one will be of help to identify the new visionaries.
"The researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn government funding," Lee said.
"Not China takes the academic leaders, the corporations," the man claims.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the US strengthen its II programme.
"I believe that doctors in II science should automatically offer green maps," the man said.
The U.S. National Council announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explains.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Intelligence Commission.
This month DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, more than 100 million dollars a year are currently invested in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative body, which wanted to set up a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would allow a lasting dispute with Greece for decades, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is a claim against its territorial integrity and therefore imposes a veto on its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opposers argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while his boycotting campaign casts a shadow doubt as to whether the referendum would achieve the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The issue of the bulletins is as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that their price deserves to be paid to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of the state of Macedonia in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of it to such an extent that the vote is already decisive.
In order to change the name of the country, two thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote.
The National Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 afternoon.
However, electoral activity was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters visited the clocks.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will find a way to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents set up by the boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
"Our state may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after issuing his own voice.
The stater also said that the positive result would lead to "the confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies publishes results of the study that between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the required activity.
Another study, the case of Macedonian TV Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70% said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the election activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government's policy since it won power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes through the entire defense of Brighton and marks the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have overcome Breaton's defense and have won Manchester City with a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's play for his naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goldsmith was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He ran three shields from Brighton before printing the ball into empty space ahead.
Then Aguero turned around by four players in green.
He slipped next to one of the defenders, and then left behind the rest of the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English attacker with a touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who struck with his right foot across the door of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is struggling with some contusions in his legs," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored naked right now."
But Sterling was the one who secured the original advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He got fired in the 29th minute.
In the case of naked Aguero, he got a deep injection in the middle of Brighton.
He immediately released a stray dog on the left flank to Liroy Sane.
Dream advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a dog on the far side.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to cut off close, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hofenheim in a match from the group phase of the Champion League at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday afternoon of "Rain Nekar Arena" in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sugar wants to play certain fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't qualify for the playwrights, there's no special meaning for another game of a title-starting painter.
And yet the ambitious Sugar hopes to be the title Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is important to Rockies, who run with a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the "Wild Card" game after victory with 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but it is not yet certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a good match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them during the year.
Why would I want to miss such a match?"
Nationals have not yet announced a starting drinker for the week, but it is expected that they will allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a starting painter this year, when he held a training Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-hand painter throws a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes at 220 2/3 inches during this season.
Trump is recruiting supporters in West Virginia
The Kosovo President referred to the situation with his voter for the Brett Kawanau Supreme Court while speaking about the importance of the republican votes in the general elections.
"By November everything we have achieved will be at risk.
They leave five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, actually I also participate, that is why I am fighting all the strengths for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he goes on with: “You all see this horrible radical group of democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to restore their power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses to their integrity, to their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run to get in power and control, because they only care about power and management, but we won't give them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves up to "stop and stop".
"What we've all seen in the last four days," he continued, calling the democracies "enraged, disgusting, vile and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, referring to the Senator of Democrats Diane Finstein in particular, which caused strong protests from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the documents?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I waited – it was a really bad hoax – maybe the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labarists are no longer wide open.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, a few were surprised.
In the end, I am just the last member of Parliament of the Labourers, to whom it was said that he was not welcome - just because I speak out.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, had this kind of attitude, as he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed during the time of previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour Meeting said on Friday that "we want the meetings to include everyone and be beneficial".
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labourers in Parliament, Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of "lighter and moderate" policies have long been forgotten if they were ever on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was assessed on the basis of this as much as the party's leadership likes.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while my colleagues, whom I had previously worked for, thought that they shared similar political views, began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never agree with – whether national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say in fact – there is a whole pitiful tiara in the social networks, where it is called for response, rejection of moderate policy, statements that it does not belong to the Labourers.
Like this isn't just happening to me.
In the interest of the truth, I know that I've even drawn more luck than some of my colleagues, as the comments for me are at least primarily of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and the focus of these colleagues who face sexual or racist delusions every day, without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such attempts have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the labers had to embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with every sign of mistrust or change in the rules of choice becoming increasingly narrower.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to bend, not to say so much, and then "all will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labourers 32 years ago, as a student provoked by Thacher's government, which through its neglect led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local adviser or as a minister.
I have never held back my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state strives for Brexit, it will harm the households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the labers.
But actually my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourers, or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of response or political rejection will deny me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Ear 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Ears led in the ranking
The two late essays may have changed the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennant's High League.
The team is already heading the rankings and the only one of the ten teams is without loss to date.
The best protection and the best use of the opportunities have proved to be decisive in a match from which coach Peter Merchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still lost," Merchi noted.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Er, they really took advantage of their provisions better than we do."
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Klimo, led Eer forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to hit the result after Jason Bagot realized the essay followed by an unsuccessful additional hit.
The climate increased the lead for Air from a penalty strike shortly before halftime, marking the axis after solo action, and then realizing the additional blow with which it made the result 17-5 for Air on the holiday.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's axle, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the front to only five points.
It follows a continuous stop of the game due to the heavy contusion of Ruard Nott, which was carried out on the carrier, and after the renewal of the game Air increased their advance after Stafford McDoual's axis and a successful additional hit of Klimo.
Then Air Blair McFerson's active captain got a yellow cardboard, and Melrose again took advantage of their numerous advantages as they showed strong pressure and realized the axis through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional impact.
However, their hosts returned to the presence of the spirit and when Stroan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard, after meeting the Climo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal play Mcferson realized the essay with the help of the advanced offensive line of Air.
Klimo realized the additional blow, and not long after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's drawn ball and took the wing of Gregor Henry on the flag for the fifth axis of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kirnan appears to have directed to a more specific and warm sector, after it was found to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis is playing in the popular BBC broadcast, which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemfil.
The two announced that the next ninth season would be the last for the broadcast, as it seems that Kirnan is already planning his life after Craiging.
According to the official registers, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan intended to join the "prominent restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": no way out of the sea Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are constantly patrolling the intricacies of the La Paz Marine Station.
There's an ocean blue flag on public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us right.
It's our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as well as the call to swim again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest of decades here, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, everywhere there is pride and unity, with the country expecting a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Caldazila.
Many Bolivians will see the conviction of the international court on the large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is going to go to a controversial re-election battle next year, has also put a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Morale promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court taking a decision for Bolivia's sake is quite small.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to take over the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the international court's conviction is only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem of access to the ocean was separated from the current Bolivian government," Zarate said.
Then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric made a difference and that little remained Chile's good will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue has occurred.
Both sides do not support diplomatic missions in one another since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken in an unusually fast manner.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides".
Kalzida also rejected the idea that Morales – which continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political paterica".
"Bolivia will never give up her right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"Punishment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems".
North Korea claims she won't continue nuclear disarmament until she can't believe the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho says his country will never approach nuclear disarmament first if he is unable to trust Washington.
Ree presented her speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of relaunching the unprecedented nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un from North Korea.
Ri called the idea of continuing with the US sanctions and objections to a declaration that would end the Korean war will cause the North to fall on its knees.
Washington is not willing to agree with the statement without first making a significant gesture on the way to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Phenyan they are serious about their withdrawal from the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompey plans to visit Phenyan next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last piece of massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sunlight, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, who were laughing at the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Quite impractical hats I caused a wave in Instagram in summer, when the designers sent the eye-catching creatures to ridicule the fashion community.
Valentino's exhaling proposal was an extravagance belt hat with an attractively wide periphery that literally absorbed the heads of the models.
The other too huge accessories included decorated with jewelry dins, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not intended to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at that time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had covered lips and reminded not of the high fashion but of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designers looked like a diving equipment in a full set of snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a hot funish ice cream.
If you fall into such fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come quite soon after "La Bomba" – the straw hat with two feet periphery, which was seen on the heads of all – from Ryana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult to the extremely impractical hat that took over the social networks led to the emergence of another huge design on the fashion platform – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the one wearing it with a bathroom model.
The bag of raffia with the color of roasted orange, with raffia sharp and strapped with a handle of white skin, was the attractive all views of the article in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion shops next summer – after the designer made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for herogabarite accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic distinction, as this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the test results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can form and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable objects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone we understand about him, your words will reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first and foremost with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS students show that 72% of students achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills, of which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as an object of free choice by students are treated as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) as well as in programs of independent schools and beyond.
In 2014, the UK Employment and Work Skills Commission showed that for the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees, 17% have indicated insufficient language skills.
As a result, the rule of foreign languages becomes increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill that remains for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling several languages of a person one breast in front of the competition.
According to a study of YouGov among more than 4,000 adult citizens in the United Kingdom in 2013 75% did not own a foreign language well enough to carry out language, as French was the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
The control of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland every school will be different from taught languages.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment it cannot be denied that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country, which must be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages must really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, together with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.

Lebron will make his debut for Lakers this week in San Diego.
Waiting is almost over for the fans who are eager to see Lebron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers Luke Walton's coach announced James will take part in the first match of the pre-season team against Denver Nuguets in San Diego.
But it's still not specified how many minutes he'll play in the double.
"It'll be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," Walton said through Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudel told Twitter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games from Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the new season," he said.
Tromp meeting in West Virginia, channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump, which include stops at well-known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmatory vote for its election to fill the free place in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened by a loss of control over Congress in the November vote.
What time will the Trump meeting be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Tromp's visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider hearings this week for nominations to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, where tension arises due to allegations of immoral sexual activity, which keeps the Senate's confirmatory vote up to one week as a result of an investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans to raise an inertia to the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five meetings next week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season with commitments," Reuters spokesperson for Trump's campaign, which refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willing, can bring supporters from "Ohyo and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The second trip to Trump this month will take place on Saturday in West Virginia – the state in which it won with more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who remains in the sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to push him into social research," said Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Raider Cup" 2018: The US team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue "forsom" the matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what the "Rader Cup" needed.
The change of the advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unconditionally, even more in competitions such as this.
So, who's in a better position right now?
"There were six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've got a little inertia," Jordan Spyte said at the end of today's competition day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points at only twelve more to be allocated.
As Spitt says, however, the Americans have something else to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge in the sports form of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
Spitt shows a great shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The cheers of the fans were becoming stronger as he made progress in the round, in which with a precise blow he balanced the result in the fourth match, after with Thomas left with two strikes after the first two holes.
His blow, which won the 15th hole match, was met with strong alarmed reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own match," Spite says.
That's all that's left to these players right now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas over the last two days are French Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the unmistakable heroes of "Rader Cup" so far.
The strange but amazing couple from Europe won four out of four, and they seem to be getting everything.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "gods" on Saturday mornings or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way in which it seemed to pass energy between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win on Sunday and there would be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari who would bring the potential victory of Europe while the sun rises above "Le Golf National".
For preference both at the same time at different holes.
However, the stories of European fame have become a bit premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson were quick to deal with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball games in the morning while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Gods" and two "dabula" of the first nine holes brought Spanish and Swedish into problems they failed to cope with.
But there's no way anyone else can solve your problems in the Sundays.
"Fourball" and "foursome" games are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the tips that exchange between each other, and the way in which a strategy can undergo changes at any time.
The Europeans played better team, and that's why they got a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome game session showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, were strongly skeptical about.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after taking the US with 10-6 after playing the matches from the fourball and foursome formats on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and French Molinari started with two victories against the inconspicuous Tiger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race increased to four points.
In an attempt to bring back a trophy that had lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the U.S. tomorrow 'fourball' matches that made a mistake after a mistake, and finally Europe won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. proved to be more resistant to the "foursome" games where they won two victories, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points of the 12th single match on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood was Europe's first new champion, won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as "Moliwood", after this sensational weekend became only the second pair, won four points of their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unappealably beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the "fourball" games, they were extremely motivated to defeat the Woods and the American novelist Braison Dekambu with an even more categorical result of 5&4.
Woods, who barely passed through his two games on Saturday, was only occasionally demonstrating highlights of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 matches in "fourball" and "foursome" matches, as well as in total seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for tomorrow's "fourball" games, partnered with Henrik Stanson in "foursome" matches at the victory with 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copka – number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a pleasant, cold and cloudy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a hard win with 2§1 against Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" games, and later they returned to win Polter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 in the "foursome" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team been able to raise four points of deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, the Furic team will hold the trophy even at the same time.
However, after they had been on the run for two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of returning on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says "there's no way" to disarm unilaterally, with no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced to the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening mistrust in the United States and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Rei Yong-how said that "significant measures of good will" have been taken in recent years, such as nuclear and missile testing, the destruction of the nuclear testing facility and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without having confidence in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances have there been any way of disarming ourselves unilaterally."
While Rei was expressing the well-known complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "stepping" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, as it took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, as he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as he did in the past.
Rei called for a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", and Trump provided security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is striving for the official end of the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that Phenyan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for relief from severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists "first to remove nuclear weapons" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is meaningless to those who do not know us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention whether it is planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the US leader stressed earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jain over the past five months and added: "If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea, rather than the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an end.
However, the tone of Rei's speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN general meeting that the direction of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after "evil President" Trump called Kim "a human rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year in UN Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction", he praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much work was still ahead and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump stressed that there was no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue without fail until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament has been carried out."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the nuclear programme and the Phenyan ballistic missile programme.
Pompey met with Ri at the summit of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
This year Pompeii visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that he had made progress, but only after a few hours North Korea accused him of having made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
The Harvard students on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world often don't even think about the basis for how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the hospital in Brigam and the women's hospital, prepared a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me this right now, in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of the dream that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which takes place for the first time this year, explains to the students what is most important about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to take a course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-time course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a living room, where students sneeze over cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how the sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
Another part of the participants reported how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of smoking," added Professor Kaiser.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he added, that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficient and quality sleep must be the "secret weapon" of students in the struggle with stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, as the withdrawal from sleep infamilies the brain in a hunger mode that keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler to prepare the course, taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says his course has "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends students to consider whether to set up an alarm for sleep and awakening and to know the harmful effects of "blue light", emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 – 0 Rangers: Manga's goal broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Steven Gerard's impenetrable team and won a 1–0 victory for Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox wanted to record his first victory as a triumph guest in February 4-1 above St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team had just put Gerard's second defeat in his 18th match as a manager, who left his team with eight points less than the late Harts team, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the break, and the unconstructive ideas of the Rangers team at no time seemed close to balance.
After the Rangers' game, they're in sixth place, and Livingston is already third, leaving the second hybrid only on the head.
For Rangers there may be additional problems, as lateral judge Kalum Spence got a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that blew up Er in the semifinals of the Cup of the League of Scotland.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven-year-old of Livingstone, who pulled a point against Harts last week, and he should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team parked all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers could have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarest cases when they owned it.
They were supposed to notice in the second minute when Menga made a touch of Scott Pittman against the doorman Alan McGreeger, but the semi-protector missed the good opportunity.
Later, Kiegan Jacobs' focus from the foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Litgow turned the ball aside from the backbone.
Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought there must be an ass in the 15th minute when he met Steven Lowells, but the reference Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian claims.
Rangers had only two hits during the first half of the day, but the ex-door of Ibrox Liam Kelly had an easy hit with the head of Lasana Kulibali and the weakest shot of this Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute hit was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was fully deserved.
Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep focus again.
Scott Arfield doesn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave cold blood to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by changing Kulibali and Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing surrendered to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out resolutely and blocked the impact.
Livingston, however, continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable game for the domestic style, as Litgow and Halkette repeatedly rejected the forward long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last few minutes, but McGreger managed to deal with a hit by Jacobs, and with the next round of Litgow shot his head next to the grid.
The intruder like Glenn Middleton's reservation from Rangers asked for an ass at the end of the double after a deal with Jacobs, but Tomson didn't see anything wrong with the situation again.
Anniversary: The inventor of the giger counter
Page of our anniversary Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Gager was born in Germany.
Gager develops a method to capture and measure the radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of the device, known as the Gager counter.
A hailstone in science from then on, the gagger counter also became a cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film "Corondo Camps" was released, in which the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans apparently participated.
Husband: “What kind of God is this?
Rogers: This is a gigger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put in these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's shooting right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes withdrawing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected again into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes withdrawing immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein, common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting it again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncological Institute in Betezda, Maryland: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulating the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal carcinoma, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "training" as directed to cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat entitled "Let's Make America Big Again", with our participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was stabbed in the studio during Saturday Night Live, after he made a pointless execution, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After playing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat entitled "Let's Make America a Big Again," he declared himself against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star challenged Brett Kavana's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission on Sexual Violence Complaints by Christine Blaezie Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West performance record was uploaded to the social networks of comics Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They beat me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't come out with this hat."
They tortured me!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming to wear Superman's costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
Commentaries provoked at least twice public protests and SNL team members seemed ashamed, Variety reported, saying, "The whole studio is closed."
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
We have a lot of games to play with the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of the conservative leader TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "On one of the bravest: Thank you for being used against the crowd."
However, the leader of the current show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "being herself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") whom I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Didi's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and Pi Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snup Dog, was named Snup Lion, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Indictment for attempted murder after stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of "Igran and Thrones" Kit Harrington is against toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for the role of John Snow's battalion sword in a violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO "Igran of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor called against the stereotype of the hero, saying that the display of such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "serious" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic malehood in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from the "Song of Thrones" Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that she feels "strongly convinced" that this problem must be solved.
"I am personally convinced at the moment – what have we confused about manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach grown-up men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing male toxicity due to many male personalities.
He continues: “What is born, and what is born will be taught?
What is taught by television and the street that makes the boys feel that they need to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the history or continuation of the "Sronts Game" after the end of the show next summer, claiming that he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will participate in the restoration of Sam Shepherd's True West, a history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that dating his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and set my life ahead," he said.
Rose's playing the game, the girl the hero of Kitt John Snow loves, in fantasy series, the winner of Amy's award.
The two married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spain: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people were affected.
Only about 40,000 new cases have been reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGB communities was widespread.
According to studies on conservative values, between 70% and 90% of men who had sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Government of China promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denies that there are leaks of data from senators from the Republican Party, asserts "dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives Maxin Waters condemned the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans of the pages of the Wikipedia legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and websites on the "ultra right wing".
"False, lie, and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home address and phone numbers of the state senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Uta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capital during the hearing of the Senate's composition on the allegations of immoral sexual behaviour against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanau.
The outcome is feasible after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the publications, is linked to the Waters office, and released information about its team member, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flischer.
"There's poison in this denial," Flischer wrote.
"This implies that it does not have a temperature suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone's been charged with something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the accused's motives.
It must be calm and balanced."
Flischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavano's democrats, who was accused by the critics, that he also seemed angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a candidate from Republicans for Waters' place in the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"In fact, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had challenged the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny England's Exploited Again" -- the weak spy parody with Rowon Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for links to Brexit in every new British film, and it seems that this is also true for the return of the ex-commissioned, spy French for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will the self-embarrassing and the mimes, who say how obvious it is that we are stupid, become a new possibility for the export of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Englishman with round-eyed eyes and a "gummy" face has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic book designed for movie fans who don't speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of graceful shine, owns a little from Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bine and a large part of the person who contributed a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, it is originally based on the leaving chaos after itself a passenger and an international man who Atkinson plays in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there's one or two nice moments.
I like it when Johnny English gets closer to a helicopter, wearing a middle-aged armor, and for a short time, the feathers stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strange, especially when "serious" films such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
The humor seems to be directed rather to the children, not to the adults, but to the mutilated ills of Johnny English, which I think are not innovative and focused, since the actinson game reminds Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the terror of the agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the premiere that has been blown up and embellished the figure and already suffers from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything of his own for this quasy-Tereza-May role, but the scenario has nothing to do with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a schikoze center, but who teaches illegal lessons as an undercover agent: here are some good hits when English re-establishs a spy rock academy.
English has been called to Whitehall for immediate instruction and is meeting again with his former long-time assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is little pampered.
So Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's secret services and meet the fatally beautiful Ofelia Bouletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the vicious Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey by farses: dressed as waiters, burning French restaurant; creating chaos when they slip into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes real anarchy when trying to use helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of the house of Volta.
All the smiles are definitely taken from the previous movie, but since they're so cute and violent, there's a lot more content here for children.
A lot of intermediate production.
Like the other movies about Johnny English, I keep thinking: can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Laberists deny that they're developing a plan for British people to work four days a week, but get a paycheck for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that says the British will work four weeks, but get paid for five.
The party claims that the company's bosses want to provide the workers with the savings made by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (III), giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "save" the economic programme and the party's plans to disband the country for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for a policy review.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is a pursuit that is part of the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this effort does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labourers said: "The four-day work week is not in the party's policy I don't think about."
The chancellor in the shadow John McDonald used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he was determined to take power back from the "individual directors" and "speculants" in the utilities companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shade also mean that the current owners of shares in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Liberian government might impose "scrambling" on the basis of the established violations.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on board companies and create privatisation funds to transfer 10% of the net capital of private companies to employees who can raise annual dividends to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" if the investigation of Cavano by the FBI can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano slowed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could cause some of the senators of the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the case, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, categorical and unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Kavano and to change it, it is necessary to prosecute," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected him categorically," Grem added, turning to Christine Blassie Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the "Global Citizens" festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Global Citizens" festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and also performs such an impressive mission: eliminating poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the "Global Civilian" festival will gather tens of thousands of people of the great morale in Central Park, which will not only enjoy the executions of Janet Jackson, Cardi Bi and Sean Mendes, but will also learn about the real purpose of the event – the removal of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The "Global Citizens" festival, which starts in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" such as voluntary participation, sending no e-mail to a world leader, calling the phone or connecting in another way to help raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is "Global citizen" 12 years before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a great way to be convinced to require action or is it just another case of so-called "climbing" – people think they're doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global citizen" has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters, which insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and communications arising from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds provided have already directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Food", established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, engagement with "helping children develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note," said the Ambassador of the "Food Force" Tracy Ulman in front of the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been undertaken, which call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has reported funding for a project, "The Power of Food", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CZV's website, asking, "Why do you think we can stop the extreme poverty?"
"Global citizen" answered: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But as in the great civil rights movement and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie Bi, Janel Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Deborah-Lei Fernes and Hu Jackman.
The U.S. may use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its military forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products into markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – more specifically, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, as they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink turned to those present at the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is represented as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, to stimulate and replace the fuel," he said, while at the same time defining Russia as "one-number pony", with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with strengthening the exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump turns Berlin into a "premises".
Moscow has stressed several times that the 11 billion dollar pipeline of the North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's burning opposition to the project is merely produced for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Federation of Industry (DBDI), urged the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI, after a recent meeting between the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take seriously" the presidential nomination in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" the presidential nomination after the inter-elections.
During a city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering applying.
"It's time in Washington for women to come in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the presidential nomination."
Warren expressed his opinion regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was exposed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters themselves do not think that it should be applied for in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not apply, according to the study of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this nomination.
Sociological research has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed on potential candidate in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Bydon and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byidon said he would make an official decision in January, reported Associated Press.
Sara Palin pointed out the PTSR of Track Palin at a meeting for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the entry in September.
He was arrested and charged with an accident with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, after returning, is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSR and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, corroborated, returned and wondered if they would receive this respect which they and their brothers had given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, is included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alarming state, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman of Vasila's police department.
18 states and district Colombia support the new asylum policy dispute
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the judicial challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum for victims of gang violence and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18th states and the county submitted a request of goodwill in Washington in support of the seeking asylum and arguing politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff on the Grace v. Sessions case was not disclosed, which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed against federal policy in August.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of the cruel members of his gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates come to the United States, such as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned the decision of the 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed immigrant documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia's lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be examined according to the specific facts and circumstances and such prohibition violates this principle," the report of good will says.
In addition, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants is damaging to the US economy, insisting that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Refugees are given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," Cession said in his communication of 11 July on politics.
The purpose of the shelter was never to ease all the problems – even not all the serious ones – that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate efforts to save the Palu while the death cases are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusumma, calming her sick boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the liner carries more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents are noted to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their floodwaters.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the hospitals injured by the 7.5-magnetic earthquake are filled.
Some of the victims, including Two Harris, who suffered a break of the back and shoulder, were found outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly due to continuing second trimesters.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recalls how he felt the terrible earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the destroyed wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with his family to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "bracing" with "propaganda"
One week after an official newspaper in China posted a four-page advertisement in the US daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump called on China Daily's paid publication in the Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China in an attempt to interfere in the American Congress elections on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Peggy is trying to interfere with the American Congress elections noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue promotions to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in a escalating trade war, in which import tariffs are balanced between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump.
Teri Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has been a source of American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles this brake by placing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the respected tradition in America of freedom of speech and the press, releasing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the contrary, on a newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and will not see the true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He adds that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With the heat of the Kavano Republicans are blocking women's voters for inter-elections, analysts warn
Since many of the high-ranking republicans are behind and protecting the nominations for the Brett Kavano Supreme Court regarding several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, particularly from women, during the forthcoming inter-elections.
Emotions around the table are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Rahr, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, in front of The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rahr said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors ran "Noemvri is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, as Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Kavano despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blassie Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," said Stu Rottenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"The people say the problem is already serious; this is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts assume that she can follow a response if the Republicans insist on confirming her candidacy.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavano is on the table. It's about the way Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," said Gay Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe in as a result of the testimony of Ford and Kavano, as they tend a little more to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents either believe in Ford's testimony or believe in Kavano's testimony, and 35 percent say that they believe in Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent say Kavano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
After Flake's insistence at the moment, the FBI investigates Ford's allegations, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the senate's judicial commission that Kavano attacked her in a state of distress when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the High Court candidate showed her genitals before her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Burners-Ley starts a start aimed at competing on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open code of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Burners-Ley, the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We need to do it now," he said about the start.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online store of personal data" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through every browser, and at the same time is all of them at the same time.
The unique feature of the online data repository is that the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "given the right to personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Burners-Leye, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, a project contract, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, world technology developers can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Ley wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Leye has had a strong influence on the debate on network neutrality.
Although Inrupt starts, Burners-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Burners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: In memory of the priest worthy of the cross Victoria during World War I
They mark 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest worthy of the cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Colonel Bernard Van won the September 29, 1918 prize at the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not realizing that he was worthy of the highest military honors of the United Kingdom.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday of his two grandchildren on a parade in Rusden, Northamptanshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "exclusively symbolic" the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's work, earned with medal.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and heavy fire from artillery and cards.”
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "incredibly bravery" led the building forward before attacking an artillery weapon with one hand and beating three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Van set up a wedding after the parade, led by "Brentwood Imperial Youth Band".
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night waiting to see a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can not become witnesses to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 doubles, including six of the main map and had to be broadcast live night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in Britain were amazed when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were built until early hours, especially because of the twins.
Fen described on Twitter the switch to the children's animation film as "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m., so the program was changed with child-referencing," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of emissions.
"Peppa pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said they'd be working on meeting planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There are, however, six mornings on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will take place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're working on it anyway.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages, and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that kind of government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five doubles instead of six – as we usually do. We have tried to provide more to the fans, but we have exceeded.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling lower than everyone else because of his sexuality – but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman claims that until he started studying in high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent director of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in hospitals for a few months.
In his participation in Lavern Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else while he was growing up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and the fact that I am different from others are, in fact, things that give me energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was something, he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT's campaigns and used his participation in the British community's annual Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he did this because he is happy that he can live openly without consequences and wants to inspire "hope" of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – he was "sudden."
Daley married Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he said, "for the first time at the 14th Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone of your age who's had similar withdrawals and falls."
They both became parents in June, and they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says that "his whole vision of peace" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I only care about winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – as he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, nor in the first place," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that it was not invulnerable," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I simply knew that I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping to the Olympics in front of the public at home. There was no more great feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – "Proud" by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him nervous.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
The lost form of Mikelson remains on the "Rayder Cup" chart on Saturday
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday when he will win his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be bound to failure.
Mikkelson, who has participated in the two-year event for the 12th time record, was left on Captain Jim Furick's "fourball" and "foursome" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being once again a major figure in the US team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his strikes from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old sportsman, who was never even at the top of his career among the most regular players, is not in the best shape for the difficult game of "Le Golf National", where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong hit.
And if the game itself is not worrying enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will face the exact champion of the British Open French Molinari, who is on a team with the new defender Tommy Flitwood and are trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave four points before the 12th match on the single make a strong start, it may turn out that Michaelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, slammed my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Glory and he's given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in two games.
I was expecting him to play more, but that's just how it happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most of the games at the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at the Ryder Cup, which has never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He's funny, sarcastic, passionate, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than that just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advance can soon be achieved
The European team captain, Thomas Byrne, knows from personal experience that the great advance accumulated before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can be easily removed.
The Dutchman debuted in the "Valderrama" match in 1997, when the team with Captain Sve Balisteros led by five points in front of the Americans, but right on the final law was almost achieved and barely managed to win with 141⁄2-131.2.
"You continue to remember that we had a big lead on Valderrama; we had a big lead on Brookline where we lost, and Valderrama won, but very hard," said Bjorn, after the 2018 European team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6 of Le Golf National.
So history has to show both to me and to everyone on the team that not everything is over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing happened until you saw the final result on the table.
We have a goal and she's trying to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I've been saying all along that I think about only the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our opponents, who are one of the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the holidays.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow in the foreground, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all going well, but when you go out alone, then you're testing your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to get to the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must give himself up to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the rival Jim Furick will want his players to introduce themselves better individually than as partners, as exceptions are only Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Furik himself was from both sides of these great reverses in the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was from the losing side when the Europeans performed the "Minenah Miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Krenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw on Brookline as well as on Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate games are played under enormous tension.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we want to try and do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McKilroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I chose these players in this order, because I think it gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The newest flag of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships since the Cold War, but this would not be achieved at least by next year due to incorrect systems and mainly increasing costs, local media reported.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the brand new baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites an army spokesman.
The naval court had to join the military forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some steal technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frescoes must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the port of residence.
However, the continuous delays mean that the avant-garde military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate force beyond the ocean – will be old when they enter into operation, Die Zeit notes.
Bad F125 F125 entered the title last year, when the German fleet officially refused to release the shipyard into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of essential "software and hardware defects", which make the warship useless if sent to a war mission.
The software deficiencies are particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military forces to add future upgrades.
It is considered that the 7,000 tonnes Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project – including for training of the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is thought to have reached the staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frescoes are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the military forces of Germany are bending.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Commission, admitted that the fleet is in fact "depleted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said that the problem has grown in time, as the old ships have been removed from operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complains that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates can be included in the fleet.
The National Trust Follows the Secret Life of the Trails
A new study carried out in the Scottish mountains is designed to determine how the trailers use a landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying bats and will help to manage future conservation actions.
The study of scientists from Scotland's National Trust will follow the frequently encountered attachments as well as the brown water slides at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the property to track the activities of the trailers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the adhesives as well as which species they publish.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the trailers and how they are used by every species.
This information will help determine the benefits of the work on management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain the forest areas for the trailers and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, there has been a significant decline in the population over the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their homes and lead to the loss of their homes.
The risk to populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the adhesives are not blind.
However, due to their habits of night hunting, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to intercept insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, accepts the attachments very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular investigations, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first in Scotland and the only special trailer reserve in the Thrave property in the area of Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten species of trailers in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's property says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great field for trailers," he noted.
"We have old buildings, very old trees and completed suitable housing.
But there are many more things about the adhesives that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He stresses the importance of checking the availability of adhesives before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible to destroy an unfavourable place of refuge to kill up to 400 women and young adhesives, as well as to destroy the entire local population.
The adhesives are a protective species and it is illegal to kill, brake, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish servant in the Trust for the Protection of Adhesives, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our trailers and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified allegations of rape against him as "false news", saying that people "want to become known", using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape of American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims that he then paid her $375 000 to shut down the incident reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, addressing its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo affixed the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," Gold Ball's five-time host told the camera.
"They want to become known by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to raise my back popularity, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "unauthorized publication of personal life suspects", according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage of an amount consistent with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football room where they claimed he had raped her anal, according to the documents filed in the county court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the Ronaldo incident he fell on his knees and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99%", but in this case he just surrendered to "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "feared by revenge" and was concerned not to "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she continues to live with the trauma from the incident.
During the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret forever", that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever", if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "an alarming thing," that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a transaction could lead to job losses.
In the factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, last year nearly 150 000 cars, 90% of which are exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain left the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in Brexit cases without a transaction.
Toyota's production line works on the "precise time" principle, with the parts arriving at every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU for cars made by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a transaction on 29 March, there may be problems on the border that industry considers could lead to delays and partial shortcomings.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in the factory in Darbisher, they said from the company, so the production will stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's "shamming" plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cualaris, who has worked in Burnaton for 24 years and is the founder of the United Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I feel that if these jobs go, they will never return.
A government speaker said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week", as he continues to fight the candidate for the Brett Kavano Supreme Court, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein observes the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's intervention in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential impediment to justice by the president.
This is whether Trump will fire Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not, and thus threatens Miller's independence, for months nourishing Washington's hearings.
Earlier this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" fired Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal commission, which they witnessed both Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday for Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be a week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The leader of the presentation Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders refused that rare press conferences are not because of the "demonstrational behavior" of television journalists, although he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstration behavior."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, as an addendum, without quoting evidence: "We have verified these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often and you're witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conferences after you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may show why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior before the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health turned to EU employees at the National Health Service of Scotland regarding Brexit fears
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the gratitude of the state and their desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months until Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, pending decisions in this fall.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible transaction-free scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to remind you how much I appreciate each servant's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Friends from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of health services, as it is for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after he has had a head trauma
Tenesy State Tigers Liner, Christian Abercrombie, undergos an emergency operation after he gets head trauma during the meeting on Saturday, when his team lost Vanderbilt Comodors with 31-27, reported Mike Authority of Tenesy.
The senior coach at Tennessee State, Rod Reid, shared with reporters that the trauma happened a little before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel submitted Abercrombi's oxygen to the side line before it was placed on the carrier and was included in the undergarments for further inspection.
Tennessee State official confirmed before Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby had gone out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/seriousness of the injury", as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second student with college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five locks before leaving the match, which makes a total of 18 locks for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher Herb tax when purchasing real estate in Britain
According to new conservation plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in herb tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The state treasury expects an increase of over 120 million UK pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher Herb tax on the purchase of real estate in Britain, as additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and directed towards people with high incomes.
The increase in herb tax will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional revenues will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current tax on herbs, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for the purpose of surrender – may amount to up to three percent.
The state treasury expects the proceeds to increase by up to 120 million UK pounds a year.
About 13 per cent of the newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to invest in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become "spacious cities", due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high property prices, robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for affordable dwellings to repair the "housekeeping" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including the control of rentals and the end of the "no wine" expulsions.
He also wants to provide the councils with greater power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as a prime minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not normal for people who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies to buy as easily as the hard - working inhabitants of Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the tear from the street's sleep remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the team of Scotland."
Sunderland Manager Jack Ross said "the greatest ambition" in his career is to be a senior coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish accepted the challenge of renovating a club from northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points from the first.
He moved to Steadium of Light this summer, after last season he took St. Miran back to the Scottish High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I wrote a match for the B team, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the matches of Scotland of Hampdon, which we watched as a child with my father, so the national team has always drawn me.
"This opportunity, however, would only be open if I succeed at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers are Dick Advocaat, David Mois, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former teacher said he did not experience any concern as an heir to such well-known names in such a famous club, as he had previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success at this moment will be measured by a positive answer to the question "Can I get this club back to the High League?"
Because by structure, basis and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I'll assume that I've succeeded here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has been a manager for only three years, having spent some time as a helper in Dumberton and 15 months at Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Aloa not to fall into the Third Division and turned St. Miran from a winning team in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlipoul, Folkirk, St. Miron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really on the cross," he remembers when he took Aloe.
"I really believed that being a manager is the best way for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making good money, and having some significant success.
But sometimes it's hard to be a player.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I've really done it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin my whole conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, discovers research
Summer heat increases the income of the fighters to survive British pubs, but increases tension for chain restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: "Because of the long solar time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup, in July, followed a similar pattern as in June when the pubs reported growth by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants got even more hit.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drink bars reported the best results in their growth compared to the down movement of restaurants.
Food bubbles also suffered from the sun's weather, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while food has a 3 per cent decrease."
Paul Newman, of the researchers on recreation and entertainment RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we observed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the field of services outside the home.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to suffer, although a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for food business managers and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the spread of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the execution of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion UK pounds, and is a strong indicator in the industry.
One in five children hides from their parents a secret profile on a social network
One of five children – some barely 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed research
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" profile that shows their parents
One of the five children – some of them 11 – creates a profile on a social network that is kept secret by adults.
Study among 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "basic" profile that shows their parents, while at the same time they have secret profiles.
A mother who entered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "violence".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) at independent schools found that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of them admit to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC leader Mike Bucanon said: "It is striking that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Alyid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyid Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as the director without the executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's lightball with most achievements, and President Ian Beatty has set this move as a wonderful opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from its rich international experience in the last decade.
"Elyid is delighted to have great respect for the light athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that light athletics in Scotland will bring great benefits by attracting her," Biteit said.
Doyle said, “I want to be the voice of athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the finals of 200 and 400 metres of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his overall four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator in BBC, has lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He writes on Twitter: “A month ago, I got hit.
I couldn't go.
Doctors said only time would show me if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I got full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing motion training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Ad for a feed pump that compares mothers to cows, divide online opinions
The company that produces feed pumps divided online opinions with advertising that compares nursing mothers with cows that touch.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected "first wireless feed pump in the world suitable for wear", the consumer technology company Elvie released a silky music and video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new feed pump provides.
Four real mothers dance in a cow's web, full of hay, on the background of a song with text, including: "Yes, I do, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not we, these are my breasts".
The song continues: “Smash, pump, with them I feed the babies, pump, pump, water my friends.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it minimizes the "horror" of the milk processing industry.
"It is very foolish to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The feed pump Elvie gathers discreetly in a nursing home (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them for a mother's nursing pump that can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "So bad ad."
Others protected the ad, as one woman admits that she considers the song "exceedingly fun".
"I think the idea is great.
I'd buy one like that if I was still feeding.
Excitement made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a bit of a rat, but I accept it as it is.
This product is great," someone wrote.
Another comment: “It’s a funny advertisement directed at mothers who give up (usually in their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like “cows”.
It is not an advertising that commends or condemns the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that they danced with the discreet pumps placed in their support.
The concept of the campaign is based on seeing that many women who feed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely sound, no wires or tubes and is gathered discreetly in a nursing home that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go outside while they leave.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, comments: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between dairy cows and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the release of milk and all the challenges associated with this, while at the same time showing the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump falls into the leading news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Jakobovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, partly because acute rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration made it difficult to accommodate children with teachers.
Usually, most lodgers are immigrants without documents, who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to admit a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, as these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior employee in the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become teachers of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either hostages or members of the family of the hostages are illegally residing in the country, most of whom are aliens-criminals.
So we'll keep chasing these people," Albens said.
In order to deal with the registration of these children more quickly, the authorities imposed new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their detention, and not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the prisoners.
Many appear in video conference conversations, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are defined as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent beatings or escape attempts, according to the shelter and reports that have been available from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be neglected because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving children to "the tent town" without being given enough time to prepare for emotional level or to say good-bye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey's "occupational troops" to withdraw immediately
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally residing in Syrian country under the pretext of combating terrorism and "their respective actions will be taken".
"They must be removed immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war against terror is almost at its end" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed" by both terrorist organisations and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian parts, opposition from President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the countries of the war-torn.
With regard to the Mualem refugees, he said that the conditions are proud and can be returned as "indicted by some Western countries that "flight unwarranted fears", which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to support these returns," he said.
"They turn into political issues something that is entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that assistance will not be provided for the restoration of Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war has been reached.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last great fortress of the Idlib rebels provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards the jihadists, including combatants from the Al-Qaeda front of Al Nusra, who "will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and the opposition, to form a draft of the next Syrian constitution and make the way to elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "a review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump's gonna win a second term
In this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless – like many Liberals hope – his presidency is not temporarily terminated due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the Presidency ever!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the premium rating has increased by twice to 1.05 million at CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during premium time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC is at the top of a cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC's "Last Candidate" drama, where it speaks of the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on Capitol.
Nel Skowl, a veteran screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She mentioned driving in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skowel told me that he answered her, "Why she's laughing at me."
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's stories can determine the future of "Roo vs. Wade", whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, the desire to be informed by a citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to see how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Treaty"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket of raw skin for $15,000 (“wear filled with arrogance” according to Washington Post), and the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel like part of a real show is to give you less every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, regarding the changing participants and the daily calls (eating with the National Football League, complimenting Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be gone.
When I got in touch with Mr. Flyes this week, with him on the north coast of Kauay was sunny, 80 degrees, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be separated from the television, especially when Brett Kavano had to appear before the Senate's legal commission and therefore depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we once made all those rat lectures and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments are influenced by the most controversial competition in the early elections for a place in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the reorganization of the districts of Congress and from there two titlers for the same place.
The recently redeployed district in Pittsburgh suburb points out conservative democracy Connor Lamb, who won his place from another round of partial elections last spring.
Lamb's face is against another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily represented by the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were otherwise constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th round opened a financial dispute between the main funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb died in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the round with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organisation.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauru, a spokesperson for the Department earlier this month.
But sanctions were only envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from America for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and percentage of murders.
With the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management authorities clarified their desire to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens has now announced that he will participate in the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomats say.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh reports or sanctions from Washington.
The Speaker of the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the Study
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has spoken with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If the leadership of Congress is changed, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body exactly when he is preparing to appear before the voters and perhaps even to the judges composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I am not impressed that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that the same thing about him in Europe.
All of us, on the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will go.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, except that the West had filled it and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such moments, and the immeasurable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, Americans are facing a few similar captures.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly proposed to write down the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the history of the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavano, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because I have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Grem Dorans of Rangers is an optimist to meet Rapid Vienna
Rangers are home to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against the Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group G of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-defense Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the 2-2 equality with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result can become a trampline to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but all of equality seems fair.
They were better during the first half and we – during the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night of our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match, because they achieved a good result in the past meeting, but I'm sure with the support of our audience we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened in the face of my contusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the direction rules.
The team is good and the guys are really having fun, the trainings are beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to exert all our power to forget the last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what concerns they wanted to receive, few people were discussing this with family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study share that they have discussed with their husbands the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about this.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector of the Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not predetermine your wishes.
Along with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when you choose a long-term financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles at the beginning.
Make yourself a health care officer, so that you have a certain trustee who supervises your care provided and ensures that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial officer.
You can choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so you can be prepared.
"It's not only about the financial aspect, but also about what doctors will be," asks Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was home at night outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police describe the shooting that took place around 02:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "accident act".
The injured man couldn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Due to the interruption of the communications, aid organisations cannot obtain information from Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Solavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow beach edge on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunamis.
Dongala is a regency that extends to more than 300 km (180 miles) on the coast of the island of Sulavesi.
Regency, which the administrative region, less than the province, is with an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the basis of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Cunami circled the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong storm on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered waves of tsunamis, which engulfed 14 states and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: Trus with a magnitude of 6.8 kills the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, triggering tsunamis that broke down on the south coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 kills one of the Mentavai islands and activates a 10-metre wave of tsunamis that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A sudden earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastations of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunamis are activated, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits killed the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them from the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Trac Peelin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sara Peelin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Pailin, 29-year-old, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reports and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman who was known to have sex tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paeline is detained in the Mat-Su Preservation Building and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, for sure", when he was asked to sue, the media reported.
Pileen is threatened by a penalty for three Class A offenses, which means he can be deprived of his freedom for up to one year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of a class B offense, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time Pileen has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paline.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drinking substances in connection with the incident.
His friend claims he hit her with a fist in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake that destroyed the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications network is broken, expecting the number of dead to grow in the near days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
Social networks are playing videos that show the moment of the crash.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the waves of tsunamis came over the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want a death penalty for Saifolo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the federal crime state since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipo, 30 years old, used a truck for rent at Home Depot to carry out the assassination in October of a bicycle near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, gashing pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent in connection with the request for a death penalty filed in the South Region of New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges may end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary sent a 22-point indictment to Saipo, including eight counts of murder related to a racket used usually by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and intention," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "horrible, cruel and disgusting".
"Saifolo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuko," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South of New York is looking for a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug addicts, but was subsequently sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in the federal case in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, did not show any remorse during the days and months following the assassination, according to the judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police say.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of IDIL on his phone, claims the indictment.
He also asked his hospital room to set up the IDIL flag, they shared it with the police.
He pleads innocent of the indictment consisting of 22 points.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that "they are obviously disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence of guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all those affected," Paton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously wanted the prosecutor's office not to want a death sentence.
Member of the Conservative Parliament says that NIJAL FARAZ should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz is pledged to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest of the Conservatives' conference.
Britain's former independence party leader said politicians should "taste pressure" – as one of the members of Teresa May's own party he proposed to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain "would have gone out so far", if Mr. Faraz was secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to agree with the deeply divided lines of the party was stressed by conservatives who supported the stay that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromise plan "Chequers", despite the attacks by the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of the EU as well.
The Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels in spite of the hostile reactions and urge the Eurosceptics and the Labourers to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said in front of the protesters with the slogan "Exit means going out" in Solihl that he wanted to "reject the Chequers".
He stressed that Mr. Faraz should have been involved with the others and that he should have received responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been a principle, we would have left," he said.
Parliament from Wellingbury added: "I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition attitude toward the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be atrocious.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the claim that the public opinion changed since the vote in 2016: "The perception that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely false".
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservatives, also participates in the meeting, sharing with reporters: “I just say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us to be elected.
Please stop "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Premiers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said at a meeting that politicians should "taste pressure", if they intend to change the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're meeting here today to say, 'We won't let this happen to you'.
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
"We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win at Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters moved on to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Shepa activists had raised flags with "Conservators against Brexit", after the group was launched this weekend.
Labyrist Lord Adonis competed with the conservators about the security issues of the party's application when it opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that it is possible to have the IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he'd "consider seriously" his candidacy for president
State Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the opportunity to run for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of her future during a city council in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running for a re-election in November against the state representative of the Republicans Jeff Diell, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the heart of speculation that it can take the role of Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holiouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor's building after Trump entered office.
One of the audience asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, including women at the top.
He was arrested for the death of Sims by LSU
The Baton Rose Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was an arrest suspect in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Sims from LSU was killed.
The Baton Rose Police Department reported on the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 east time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help with the identification of the man who is seen in the footage.
Sims, 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
" Wade Simms has been shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problem and detained in the arrest of the East Baton Rose Police Department.
A young man with growth 6′6′′, who grew up in Baton Rose – Sims participated in 32 games with 10 matches as the holder of the last season and recorded on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches of the match.
Gran Pri of Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after his team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fetel
Since the moment Walter Botas ranks ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's instructions will play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from his first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, giving Fetel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the competition.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to overcome it after a rough maneuver and drive " rubber to rubber", which forced Ferrari's pilot reluctantly to release the inner part of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already shut down his opponent's path with a dangerous double protection maneuver on the third turn.
In addition to his 21st birthday, Max Versapen started from the back rows of the start grid and was seven after the end of the first round.
Then he even ran for a long time since he decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overcome Kimi Rykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to grow enough in the next eight rounds and finally Rykonen completed fourth.
It was a hard day, as Walter did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me fight him.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really the bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump filed a complaint with Senator Diane Finstein on Saturday about her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the claimant of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano in sexual harassment.
During a rally discussion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Legal Commission, but instead commented on how what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and disgusting and insincere".
"What can happen also the good that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't spreading."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Finstein sent a letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavano in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Finstein denies this distribution if it happened from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Finstein told the commission, The Hill said.
"She asked me to keep privacy and I kept privacy as she wished."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's alleged sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that the democrats use claims for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to restore power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to have to run away to restore power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elit League: Dundy Stark 5-3 Belfast Jairns
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for the Jaunts against Dondy.
They returned for Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Jairns, winning a 5-3 reward in Dundee on Saturday.
Jaints ran an early match with two goals after the hit of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were set up for hostess before Dewir restored the foreword of Jairus.
Francoa Bushar's equal for Dundy, before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elit League for Adam Keefe's boys who got out of the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the opponents of this season, when the last three matches won the Jaunts.
The blow that Duyer discovered the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFoul, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bovillier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to balance with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyer tried to take Jaints before the first vacation, marking the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar rebalanced the chances with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Counnie and Charles Corcoran united their efforts to help Nielsen give Dondy the lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, and he gave everything of his own and confirmed the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Jaints, who lost the last four matches of a total of five matches, meet as host Milton Queens for their next match on Friday.
Head of flight killed to make sure hundreds of people on board can escape an earthquake
A pilot of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are unaware of a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering waves of tsunamis.
The strong secondary rabbits continued to defeat the area, and many were caught in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would manage to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was fighting.
He died in the hospital later.
Air Control spokesperson, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives reported by ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the disaster response agency in the country has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase, as many bodies are still under the cracks, and many people cannot be reached," said Soutopo Purvo Nugroho's spokesperson.
Waves, which reached six meters, devastated Palu, where there is a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, shared in Sky News: “Every minute the liner brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's riots everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and turned to the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was killed by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is unconscious after a plane crash in the lagoon
The aircraft that flew by a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific now reports that one person was declared missing after earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
In the press release Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they cannot contact a male passenger.
The airline added that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local people's boats helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land on Chuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that the six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, as everyone is in a stable condition.
They remain unclear the cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airlines and the U.S. military forces said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
"That's extremely nice," says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others managed to run through the deep to the cross of water to get to the crash exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewardess had panicked and yelled, as well as that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy forces tell us that seamen repairing the nearby port have also helped in the rescue action by using the boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks into the depths of about 30 meters (100 ft).
Data from the Air Safety Network suggest that in the last two decades 111 people have died on aircraft registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office concluded its statement on the case this Saturday in the re-trial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlet of the US Ministry of Justice testified hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to ask Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that on that day he was out of town.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nasville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Mobile records indicate they've known each other for just a week.
Roulette pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He saved her from her life," Hale said.
Protection is planned to begin with its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be presented to the judges later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinions of the genre by playing his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has deviated from its origin of political statements and involvement with social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and repopulate the conscious hip-hop.
The Fugees and Common performers are opposed in Britain by performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
The second black guy?
A New Yorker judges a couple after being fired for "racist" message
A New York woman judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after receiving a wrong message from her mother, who complains that she is "the second black woman".
The two deny to be racist, depicting a desire for "impression".
Linzi Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, was smiling when she learned that the new babysitter, Gizel Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE SECOND NARRATOR," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman in her husband's text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she realized her mistake, the feeling of "unsuitable" Mrs. Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former grandmother, who was an African-American, had not done her job well and that she was expecting the Philippines, reported New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for one working day after being sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is judging the two-way compensation for the dismissal, asking for the $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was initially hired, although she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she told Post on Friday, adding, "You're sure it's discrimination."
In response to her request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that Morris's termination was a reasonable act, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had tried her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have tried, even if it was a mistake?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Speaking of "suffering", Plasco claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in "very difficult situation".
“Will you attack someone in this condition?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in the social networks, denying them their behavior and their logic.
"Padington's publishers were afraid that readers would not feel connected to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was adopted by the public, relates about the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's very fun, since we're aware of the great success of Padington."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book for a little game-playing, would feel optimistic about possibly rejecting the book, adding that he met the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as "an important member of our family", she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-glorious," she said.
“But since Padington felt so real, it’s like having a child that has achieved something: you’re proud of him, although it’s not really your business.
I think you've been taking Padington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits of Padington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter was laid, she was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled to save her life.
"Hope has always called to say that the situation is really bad, that it does not expect to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashie, honey, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to support her heart slowly stop acting and leave her system.
She's gone for a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've struggled."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far regretted the loss of her daughter, is riding on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"No one understands," she says.
"I was wearing my head and all the time the tears of my hat.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I felt this all-encompassing sense of belonging to Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grieving women set cards to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wells with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by the smile.
They've always said his smile shines every room."
However, he gave up his job before leaving, and he was in "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that this will have some consequences."
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Do not be silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphrey, Mrs. Davis' long friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days ago, we noticed a change in his condition.
He arrived at the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he looked neither at them nor at anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans of 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an e-mail to jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Cavano's future is in question after the FBI launches an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – research with limited length and limited scope – perhaps we could unite our efforts," Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Commission "was falling apart" despite the alleged precautionary blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their dissatisfaction is for the moment.
The early elections are only after five weeks, on 6 November – if Republicans are not expected to present themselves well, their attempts will be seriously affected by the election of their representative to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavano, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea "decreases" at Kim
South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came into power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, quoting data from the South Korean union ministry, said there were 1127 refugees last year, as compared in 2011 they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There's no official comment from Phenyan.
Most of the refugees in the North eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the illegal border from the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and is more easily crossed than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ), which divides the two roots.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, often repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state met in Phenyan for talks focused on stopping negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US of lack of progress ever since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no way to defend ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Rei said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavano " hysterical" and said it was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Congress Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavano "historic" and said he was too unbalanced for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if any woman had reacted in this way, they would call it "historic," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate's legal commission on Thursday.
Coffee emotionally rejected the claim that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his introductory words, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt when he was discussing his family and his academic years.
He also categorically condemned the Commission's democrats, calling their claims against him "a gross and coordinated attack on the person", organised by liberals who are not satisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that according to her, the testimony of Kavano proves that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is prejudiced against the democrats.
"I think he himself is disqualified by these claims and by the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosy denied it when asked if he would try to discredit Kavano if he was appointed and if the democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say it that way – if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's no longer only allowed to enter the Supreme Court, but also into the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about Kavano's potential decisions regarding the Access to Health Care Act or the Roo v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for an ironic, prejudiced man to enter court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great,' Pelossi concluded.
And women have to control themselves.
It's a fundamental criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I received enormous help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she told her interviewer, “You can think I’m sad because she’s crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in terms of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my most clear memories of previous work, in the office mainly with men, is like once when I was flogging out of inexplicable anger, an older woman caught me by the door – a freezing guide I was always a little afraid of – and she lured me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign as president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an external relationship of the yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should consider applying for the president herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the competition and the last thing they wanted to happen was to show up another one.
Someone called the situation "Snow and Seven Jujuices".
Since she's involved late in the campaign, she's left with a fundraiser and decides she won't stay in the race unless she can collect $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She realizes that some of her supporters who give $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, in which he states that he will not continue with an official campaign, she is the hall of so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that makes it so difficult to collect money and to be able to turn to voters, not to the delegates, as well as to anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder, how the media reacted.
"Someone might think that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?"
How the US-China trade war can serve Beijing
The first shootings in the US-China trade war were deafening and, as the battle is just beginning, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning fence this year, betting with taxes key elements from China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension occurred this week with the new customs duties affecting production for 200 billion US dollars (150 billion UK pounds) with an effective tax of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Every time Beijing turned against new customs with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to return to every hit on the United States and soon the second world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To make Washington give up means to submit to the demands, but to keep his head public in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for China's president, Si Jinpin.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, pressure from the US trade war can help China's long-term plan with reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that an accelerated political solution, both in Washington and in Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in some of the two countries, is actually more dangerous than the observers once acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a scientist on issues related to Asia to the Expert Group Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests for assistance in the reconstruction of the war-torn country has continued for more than seven years.
Turning to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem stressed that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that forced them to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and diet.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that no conditional support or assistance would be accepted from the states that financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the "Raider Cup" for 2018, as well as the US team with a final result of 16.5 out of 10.5 of the "Le Golf National" in the suburbs of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six successive losses on European land and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the champion crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Byrne reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly during most of the tournament, sent his first hit to the 16th hole (with "pair" 3) in the water with which he lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari presented himself perfectly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reached a balance 5-0-0 since the competition was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5–4 from a player in the team of Europe, which is the lowest in the ranking – Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World rankings leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter from England, for which this is probably the last participation of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight participations in the Ryder Cup, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold back today.
It was a tough year.
I'm extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can get the cup back up.
The most important thing is the team and I am happy to be able to help," said the excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He's handing over his cousin John Ram's staff, who beat US legend Tiger Woods with a 2-1 on the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his total Ryder Cup balance is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time, won 14 big titles – an indicator that only sets off on Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was having trouble all weekend, except Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf course every day from the tournament.
The captain of the U.S. team, Jim Furick, said after the team’s disillusioned presentation: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning, we pressured the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players presented themselves very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the United States Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat down.
We've just been on top of it."
