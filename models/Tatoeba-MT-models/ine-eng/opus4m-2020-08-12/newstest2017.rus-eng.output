Our thoughts and condolences to the family and friends of Frank during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said Frank was staying in the hotel first, but recently, "He's finally out of his mind."
"He found the apartment, he met the girl," said Luis Galicia to KGO.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The International Panel of Biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrae is a Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystalline eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, with a length exceeding five metres, may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the life of the shark.
The females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity of only 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that the “neighbor” of the Greenland whale lived longer than all the belligerent animals.
The oldest person known as the scientist was 210 years old.

Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is Chief Doctor of the Olga Bogush Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of his work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need a sanatorium-court rest not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
Under the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health is not ruined.
Such recommendations will not be unnecessary to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it doesn't have to be withdrawn.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And there are about 90 per cent of the arrivals.
He is the most exposed to people from large cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So you better not complicate the situation and let yourself get some rest in time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people have reduced their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend vacations with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, treatment physics.
The course of procedures shall be determined by a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, a children's club is usually working with animators where children can attend games, different master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with young children, provide the necessary conditions for the breasts and provide the services of an experienced nurse.
The mild winter, long summer, the number of sunny days per year (over 300) creates good conditions for round-the-clock rest in the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the organism needs rest not only in the summer.
So there is no fear of window weather, more than most procedures are conducted in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, health care is desirable 2 times a year, especially for adults.
The main catchment area of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanovski, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the organism.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient’s feelings.
Thus, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
"Esentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers sugar levels.
“New sensations” has anti-inflammatory, gallbladder and urticaria effects.
The same effects also have the Slavian waters.
When appointing water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it collects less salty water because the salts inhibit fluid, which leads to increased pressure.
The acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the required quantity and specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for individuals and bodies are now available in the sanatoriums.
What types of healing based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of the region?
Close to Petigorska, for example, there is the salt lake of Tambukan, adding dirt that is useful for the compositions, the bellows, and the internal organs.
It provides anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating action.
These are health walks on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodska, where there is a huge resort park (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodska, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take the baths of wines, pasta, iodine, selenium, sulfone and lacritics, depending on what your doctor will appoint.
We're extending the yield.
What can you do to make the harvest go before the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopuchova, agronomist and daughter.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to make a cut: take off the new beads, cut off the beads, remove all the leaves before the last fruit and flowers with small ligaments - they won't be able to grow.
All tomatoes, regardless of “constitution”, as well as pears and bacteriums, are fed by a gold-superphosphate extract, processed by biopharmaceuticals (Agreator - to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Phitosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from diseases, Immunocytes - to enhance immunity, Bitoxybacillus, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are harmful).
Only honey, cologne, and green honey should be used from the chemical resources at the end of the summer.
We're doing the last plant hunt.
In the heat, we lower the lower, exposed part of the stem (25-40 cm) on the ground, wet with hot water and Circone solution, wet the 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also difficult to extend the yield: cut down the old leaves, pour hot water and solution for the complexion, put the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect from night colds, place over a rope with protective material.
Keep the day of the plant open and close the sun after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia ' s exit from the most recent 20 years of recession.
According to Bloomberg analysts, GDP RF has shown a positive trend - in the second quarter of GDP has decreased by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
Russia's recent decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Minieconom Development.
The front is slow growth.
According to the CDC experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The index assessment of Russian GDP says that the recession remains behind, and forward -- slow economic growth," says the Bank of Russia 'what trends are talking about'.
The monthly GDP estimate for the current quarter of the regulator increased to 0.4 per cent and the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of Mineconomie Development reported, during the second quarter, the fall in GDP of RF was stopped in the second quarter, with 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified fall in GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline was stopped: in April it accounted for 0.2 per cent, and in May and June GDP change was within 0-0.15", - quoted the representative of MER RIA News.
The slowdown in the Russian economy during the last five quarters shows that the downturn has occurred.
Among other markers for the recovery of the national economy, Bloomberg calls increased demand for electricity and rail transport, business recovery.
If an amendment to the year is high, it is understood that the dynamics of plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be half a day-on-a-day.
Let's add a lower average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is an increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus 0.5 per cent of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality," explained Kirill Jakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent last year.
Moreover, Rosstatt's been fixing deflation for the last two weeks.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the rudder course, which, although marked by strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery, which must be followed by indicators from the real economy," says Jacobovenko.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowed from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive developments also demonstrate the situation in the labour market, where unemployment fell to 5.4%.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the issue of the real available income of the population should be left to wish for the best.
The annual rate is reduced by 4.8 per cent.
This could slow the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures contributed little to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia ' s rigid policy can also be called risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5%, which is not best affected by the real sector.
It is also a negative factor that is not sufficiently high in investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
Overall, however, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the RF economy will be slowed to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," said GK analyst Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, which has recently been launched in Russian football and has survived in the winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, until it is so actively developed in summer sports.
In the Rio Olympic Games, where former foreigners are taking part in the Russian Federation, they are in most cases natives of the former Republics of the Soviet Union.
Therefore, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a sufficient number of Russians are being subjected to the flag of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality is different.
Some parents have moved to another country as a child without leaving the choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian collection.
And someone thought that better conditions for sport development would be established abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's passport in Germany says her name is Lisa Rice.
But before she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omske.
Just four years after the Soviet Union broke up, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow the footsteps of her older sister — to take on easy athletics.
Like my sister, Liza picked up a six-pack.
She'd stay in Russia if she couldn't get Elena Isinbaevo to the throne.
Unfortunately, the Olympics in Rio Liza will be our only landlady, even the former, in the six-year-old sector.
Its best achievements in this form are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
Elena Pirozkova, 29 years old, was born in Novokuznecz in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Because of their faith, they left the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started to fight at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Training Centre she continued her training under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojnik.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first impression.
That's why the World Championship in the same year is a victory.
Before that, she was able to win silver at the 2010 World Cup.
Then there were bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in the city of Yaroslavle, where for the first time she met with a synchronized swim.
But saying that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Maria continued her activities.
She had soon joined the United States and had shown remarkable results in the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that at a serious international level, Russian synchronists could not compete, but for America its indicators were headlines.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Kristina Schaldibin at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training a girl in artistic gymnastics outside the ocean.
So far, the girl has been a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavle.
Emmigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly in that country and later broke into the main national team.
In the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For her first positions on the world stage, of course, she had not fought, but for the United States she had organised this break - she had taken out a star-palosate rally at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Another one of our former "baby" is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who is in charge of collecting Germany.
She was born in Toliatta.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more opportunities to enter the national assembly.
She had recently represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, it is true, she was able to occupy only 17 seats that were not sufficient to reach the final competitions in her own strength.
So two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Youth Olympics.
Another gymnast, only this time sports is Irina Sasonov.
If the migration routes mentioned above can be called standard, it is very unusual for the Irish family to choose Iceland.
Ira is an educator of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland she has become the country's champion.
True, Ira is still being trained in Russia, especially coming to the family to avoid losing her skills.
She wasn't as successful as she'd like to be in Rio.
The best place is 40 in private.
There is very little information on the Navy of Maria Ugulkov in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing bad results - even a record of the country at 200 metres of butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a member of the Red and White Flag.
In Rio, its best speech is 14 seats in a complex stanza of 4x100.
In order to get into the game, the girl started a Crowdfanding project that enabled her to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent most of his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasavourta's native has succeeded in becoming a three-time champion of Europe, a Russian champion, an international sports master.
When he stopped falling into our national assembly, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is known in the family even less than even for the Swiss Navy, Maria Ugolkov.
It was that his parents emigrated from the State of the East to New Zealand when the boy was quite young.
That's where Michael started sports gymnastics.
He did not achieve any greater success at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 seats on parallel brushes.
But for New Zealand, even falling into the Olympics in gymnastics is already a break.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her activities with a synchronous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014 the girl took the sixth place in a synchronized swim at the European Championship in Berlin.
In the duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Crotter is in favour of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country’s champion.
In the same year, he won the Youth World Championship.
The year later, Croiter won the gold of the Young Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the height of the bed, Dmitry has a length and a triple bed.
A 31-year-old Albert is another Hasavort native who, following long speeches to Russia, decided to change his sporting citizenship.
Unlike Batirov, however, Albert has chosen Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he was a top sports master of Krasnoyarsk, even becoming the country's champion in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a member of the USSR volleyball team of Jaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of the son of Yaroslav, he was recognized as the best volleyballist on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there for a long time.
In 2015, he was a bronze champion of the European Championship in the territory of his new family.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and became a member of the family at the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but this northern country did not succeed - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
Soon he won the World Cup among the Juniors and later qualified for the Olympics.
In Rio he will be the only representative of France in the combat tournament.
And a free fight again, and a former Russian again.
This time, the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, will be Tymuraza Freeeva.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012 and is currently supporting the country's collecting team.
Until then, a 30-year-old athlete has also been able to record high scores in Russia.
He became the bronze champion of the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
The Charter from non-refoulements to the assembly, Timeuras decided to change sporting citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahachala, Artur Bijarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
It was there that Arthur began boxing at the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been a Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 he has become a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new family since 1975.

Why do children talk at school?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, “they need to be brought up, not by actions and by parades, but by systems. ”
They must grow and at least seven years of age realize that they must be talking and education.
But as long as this job seems to me to be done formally, and I suspect it's more on paper.
If class speakers get all the positive things they've done before, at a qualitatively new level, I'll be happy.
If everything goes wrong and we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The CPC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an impactor on the funds allocated to the community from budgets at different levels.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, the over-tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of CPC.
As a result, consumers in the region have over 170 million rubles overpaid their energy.
During the days and days of the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region, the facts of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs were identified.
The cost of the IV-Consulting OOO (cold water) was 4 million rubles for the rental of cars at a higher market price.
And such examples in the country of mass.
The people are paying the last money for the "communal" with the right payment, according to the Ministry of the RF, the average payout from the population is 94 per cent.
It is charged immediately with several articles of the Penal Code: extortion, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was involved in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, which were not actually carried out but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him a lot of money back.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay and spend it to the service providers for their needs.
As a result, millions of rubles are damaged by the budget and the residents.
The Makarov machining scheme, ears typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and arrests by the leaders of the U.K., who had spent their money on citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial continues over A. Kohan, also a former forest deputy accused of machining at 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatsky, he established 6 management companies and created 3 companies with limited responsibilities.
One of them performed a series of tasks for the CU, the other two played a role in cash centres, that is, receiving money from the population.
However, to the energy sector, A. Kohan did not count the funds but lost his favorite.
It is quite difficult to judge in the field of ŽKH.
Things don't get started, they're slowing down.
And “helps” in this extremely complicated housing legislation – considers Svetlana Revoltneva, the executive director of the NP “ZKH Control”.
We don't have a law to make, like we're thinking of a new one that has to make the previous one work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on the issue of CPC.
The lawyers themselves recognize that the law of housing in knots is very little of a focus.
Refusals in criminal proceedings are also discussed in the Office of the Prosecutor.
Of the 3.5 thousand crimes committed in 2015, less than half are sent to the court.
The remaining investigation has been delayed and each fifth has been suspended due to the failure of the accused person.
There are often gaps in law enforcement activities in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the intelligence authorities will not be quick to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015 there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting, with a total of 60 criminal cases being initiated.
Over the five months of the current year, their number has only increased slightly to 99.
What is the falsification of the protocol for the collection of residents?
This means that changes in household management, financial and other issues are being addressed by the owners.
And this also means that the housing and community services market cannot be run by normal companies that want to work honestly, not "dwell" the population.
You know, the residents of the minus, the small and medium-sized business too.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Zarkov, a member of the Property Committee.
And now this work is underway.
It's not just a single action, it's a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, this is not a sad situation in all regions.
In particular, they don't smell like scandals in the capital.
Why is there no such scandals in Moscow in the field of ZKH, as in many other regions?
Until the capital Government had exercised its will and ordered, the “Aif” had told Anatoly the Electoral, member of the Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean the personnel and legislative amendments and legal education.
Management companies have been closely monitored, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of citizens are quickly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents and response measures are placed on the Government of Moscow portal).
Many do not simply pay monthly receipts, but they carefully follow what is written about the house.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow checks the validity of housing and community service tariffs, while a large part of the budget is subject to subsidies and benefits for many categories of population.
Probably all of this together explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Does everything go to the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's free to change your place of work?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, issued the U.S. Ultimate, proposing to elect Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of State coup.
He said this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up the support of the "Fethhullahist terrorist organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States is called upon to change its position.
Experts believe that the gap between Turkey and the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Early or late America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorist Fethullahists' Organization").
Or organizing the conversion of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," the Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan as saying on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey, on a regular basis, has already called for the United States to comply with its demand for the first time since the rebellion.
We recall that on the night of 16 July, the Turkish army's high-ranking representatives in Turkey attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as attempted the life of the head of the State.
However, after Recep Erdogan spoke to the population, the riot was suppressed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
A total of some 8,000 people were suspected of being teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their teacher was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that there could be American involvement in the hosperevorote.
All claims were rejected, refusing to issue Guilen and advised to change the tone.
The last statement by the representatives of Gosdepa on this point was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey from insisting on himself and also demanding other Western partners.
"Ancara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the Euro Union if Brussels does not call the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," the Minister of Turkey said on 9 August.
He said that Ankara's amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, would put Europe's own security at risk.
We note that on 1 August, German Deputy Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel requested Turkey to end the Euro Union's blackmail with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement by the head of the MIDI of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocation statement was made by Chavushoglu last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish MIDI did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the field of defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign defence States - they import rockets," Chavushoglu said in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries so far, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to search for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this refers to Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The Head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a fierce confrontation with the West.
It has a lot to do with the West and the business and the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a full obedient person in this position," explained the AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it was not excluded that after the Turkish leader ' s statements (on non-payment of EU compensation, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) would be forced upon him.
"Rezep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the Euro Union, and they will push him on precisely humanitarian issues, on dictatorial methods of country management and so on," Minchenko said.
The Head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to exchange his views on Russia as soon as he can.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very firm stand against Russia and sought favor in the West in all ways.
For a very short time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities for a while.
I think Erdogan entered the lead period.
Having found between the two Poles - West and Russia - he will try to get the greatest benefit for himself," Muhin says.
In his view, it is the main task of the President of Turkey today to retain political power in the country, so that he needs Russia and his partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting the United States of America.
Turkey needs the EU and the United States, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus with Turkey will therefore be achieved," he said.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East is Anna Glazov.
The relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are strained enough, and this is primarily linked to the internal policy that Erdogan is personally pursuing.
I think that this crisis will be exacerbated in relations, and in the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to recharge both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, said that they were ready to change their position on a number of issues concerning Syria, relations with Israel were resolved, there was an active political interaction with Iran," explained IF.ru Glazova, which would result in the normalization of relations with Egypt by the next step of Erdogan.
According to her, the policy now being pursued by Erdogan was a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey had followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was at that time that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The visit of the President of Turkey to Russia and the country of Africa has now been very successful.
The foreign policy sector will therefore develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions on both regional and international levels," he said.
The vote believes that Turkey's return to former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will start responding sharply to Turkey, which can go to the opening of the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Slashing of young doctors: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of the young doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Committee of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) intends to request its full board to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said that ministers had not been able to answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the contract agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to "seek silence" about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “In view of the situation, the JDC leader voted for the rejection of the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all your matters.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, the leader of JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve the ongoing programme for the expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six attacks this year, including the first general attacks in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after the vote on the abolition of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was good to be accepted during the meetings in advance of the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Bad Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the golden palace hall in St. Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was handcuffs, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he could hardly have been warmed up even by his own restraint standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his dear "other" Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis but even to their higher level.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the long - term cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first cause of the crisis was mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey has beaten the Russian prosecutor at the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at that time was inconceivable.
Mr. Putin was angry with the mob, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow on his back.
The insult was even more severe on the basis of the alleged friend.
Retaliation of real trust would be difficult, probably impossible.
The public opinion of Russia has also changed since November.
Over the months, the State-controlled media have carried out a horrendous, total attack on Ankara.
It was suddenly shown that Turks should be considered guilty in everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdogan ' s own family had been involved in the illegal trade in oil from the Syrian area controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
Finally, the meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of the proclamation of truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he almost got out of his position last month when he tried to change.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have been severed — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually take several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The quantity dropped sharply to almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, the tour operators and charter companies here are, of course, relieved when the flights are finally resumed.
They're putting a peak at the end of the Mediterranean season.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were re-authorized.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report in the report.
But the visit also had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara is evil to the West because it considers it a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the pace of the EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's move to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the Ankara championships for the support of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Remember, this is a data for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
Thus, the summit at this shining palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analyst described me as a “bad alliance”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated in the West are united by forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two remain in considerable differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
He may say for himself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents had given a press conference, they had not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a full disaster when a NATO member of Turkey struck a Russian reactive defendant, it is precisely better that at least two leaders speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be brought to the back office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since he moved almost eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer credit.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from Cuba to the Whambledon Andy Murray champion.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come out first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the banking of private individuals who will be more affected — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one that will employ our staff, because we are now becoming more than a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we don't have any more global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support to Cuba of six nations, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is the right time for us to drive a brand bank, because on the basis of (we were asking ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients, not our own, I think you've seen a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket at the Pristrasti.
The detectors spray the champagne after the double in Newmarket leads it to 3,000 winners
Joey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable note with his second winner at night on his home road, at the Pristrasti, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this excellent mark in smooth jumps.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idder and Willy Carson.
The three-time champion of the Dettoria jockey, who had previously won the Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket, because it's where I moved 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from affairs and very hostile.
Dettoirs take applause when they lead to predominance after victory
Two jockeys have reached such a mark in the obstacle jumps: the Richard Johnson jockey champion and the retired 20-time Sir Anthony McCoy champion, who won over 4300 awards for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner Derby, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached.
He's stylish and strong, but that's how his tactical slide distinguishes him from others in the living room.
He was a great jumper, and his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Eps, he'd bring 6,000 winners, if he wasn't just a jockey and a big jumper!
And if you're serious, Frankie's been leading the winners in Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumpers, but more than that, he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettoire celebrated this outstanding note with a firm desire to jump off a horse
From racing finishes to racing shocks, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It was takeoffs and falls.
Many of the winners of the big jumps, including his famous "Semerka" in Askot in 1996, but he also survived the avian disaster and the disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed great will to challenge the skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to compete at least until he was at least 50 years of age.
Putin releases Sergei Ivanov's administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Ivan was part of a trusted neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as a representative of the environment and transport sector.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties by the head of the Russian administration of the President”, but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanova's deputy, Anton Weino, has been appointed successor since 2012.
Mr. Wino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the management of the President's protocol and of the Government's apparatus, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
At the time of appointment, he said to Putina, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of State in developing draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin informed a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivan had asked him to be released from this position and recommended that Wynno replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
It's a move that took Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who showed on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned on his own request.
But in spite of the camera smiles, it has little convinced anyone here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
Until nobody knows.
But the official statement -- that the man who was once raised as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy -- was met with enormous scepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Kremla website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even perhaps a problem post, for four years.
Well, I've been the head of the President's administration for four and eight months.
Ivanov joined the post in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the Public Security Service of the KGB, as was Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanova among the five people he most trusted.
Sometimes it was thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second term of Putin, because the third term for Putin would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was taken up by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is released after a dragon with a producer.
Gibson was a participant in the shootings at the Los Angeles Show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced their dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotcher, apologized on Thursday before being notified of his removal.
There were creative differences in sampling and differences in opinion.
I regret that this has happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which is expected to follow the FBI agent team later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously played a leading role in the Darma and Greg network, was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love to think like a criminal and have invested my heart and soul in him for the past twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there before the end, but now it's impossible.
I would just like to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our remarkable team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could only dream of.
It is noted that the show will return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Myth: Fish landed in the Banfa garden
A Banfa man sought help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sands left with water deaths.
Bain, 500 metres from the sea, set out to take this spot to Periscope in hopes that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
Project of £1.35 billion now to be completed by May 2017
The engineers combined the northern spring and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four clashes between the "roof storms", which are now approaching the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 baths of bridge.
The project of £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the square today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the finalization between the drain and the bridge deck is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly permits.
A total of about 79 per cent of the entire bridge deck is on the ground now, for the last section of the deck the concrete cover is being poured on the Rosite today, which means that everything is ready to be taken up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first dive on each bridge project is always a significant turn.
In this amazing project, this dive is the most modern building art.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection with the expanding northern pylon road deck, we were then left to close the remaining barrier on the north or the shore.
This was done by pushing the north approach to 700 millimetres south.
It was a very large operation at the same time.
It is large, because the distance of 222 metres, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be raised at an angle of about 3 per cent.
It is remarkable because the permits that the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfr Gulf: Three men ' s luck stay alive '
Three men were "lucky to stay alive" after they were released from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was alarmed at 13:20 in British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the event unfolding in the Moelfr Gulf.
Three men from all over the force tried to reach a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship go around them and we thought it was worse," said Moelfre Vince Jones.
" Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and a third man 60 years old was found exhausted and stuck in a cage without a lifesaver.
They were all taken on board the lifeboat and delivered to the rescue station.
Johns said, "Third men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The engine of the boat had an emergency extinguisher, but he somehow separated himself from the man who operated the boat when she woke up.
Someone saved these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy desire for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children are no longer on the street to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at the screen, has been a complaint for many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people out of the sofa and involves some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited by television, then by video games, and recently by smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the Polish involvement, which is Pokémon Go, based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later the series of multifilms, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this lost its relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was then delayed due to a massive response that overloaded servers.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players go looking for Pokemons that are tracking on the GPS and, being found, can be 'photographed ' (through the boxes on your phone) or 'receptions'.
The generation that played in the game, being younger, joined in a slow engagement, ridding itself of the monsters to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of “normal” steps per day.
The Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days from the start of the game, the number of people who followed them, who had performed 30 minutes a day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing in Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the level.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “find 30 minutes”, “get up from the sofa” and “be active every day” have not found a response because most of the health messages are boring and people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercises cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring them here.
But Pokémon Go is that it pushes people down the street to do what they love.
Thus, three health principles are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms that seek to appeal to.
And yes, someone can tap the door.
Well, what?
The breakup happened.
Because despite the fact that smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, could track our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason for the exercise, as this game gives us.
The news will arrive, and the use will slow down over time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bailes wins the gold of an absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the sum.
Simon Bailes is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on-board.
Not forced on the thigh.
I'm a sex-rocketer.
Shocking everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of a champion of absolute excellence on Thursday, placing a gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the utmost Olympic attention.
Its general ball 62.198 was far enough away from the silver medalist and partner of the Final Peterka team, Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafina.
Bails from the United States is performing in high school during the final of the Women's Individual Absolute Award for Artistic Gymnastics 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails became the fourth-ranking American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute excellence and fifth at all, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps at any time.
She was upset when she was shown her final general ball and her long journey to this point ended.
This achievement puts it in the same league as only rare athletes like Michael Fellps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bails has spent the last three years in his form of sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup, including 10 gold, with such horrific programs in their mix of labor and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One final test was expected in Brazil, not so much a match between Bails and the others in this area as between her and the load of expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with gold medals, would be viewed as an unreasonable expectation.
Simon Bies from the United States, left, and Ellie Reisman are engaged after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship on artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bailes earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a last-minute party of retired national collecting coordinator Martha Karoli.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked forward to the future during her long journey to the summit, that was not the case.
Part of her program of free practice — which includes her firm passage — is based on Latin American music, which would go straight home on the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was devastated by her grandfather and grandmother as she began to walk with the baby and was the mother of Coach Amy Burman during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach became a force.
She has not lost any competition on the absolute priority since the summer of 2013 — a bond that should continue for as long as Bails would like.
Although Mustafa had a small advantage with two turns, it was a relief.
The gymnasium and free exercises — where Bailes is protecting the world’s champion’s name — are on the ground.
She went out again from 15,433 in September and ended from 15,933 in the sex.
Reisman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account — a clean formality — and tears appeared around a shining red and blue beige for the eyes of Bies when the idea she had once recorded in the cutting album came true.
Reisman's speech was a small place in the past four years when she divided the third place, but lost the bronze of Mustafain on the breeches.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call "baby" was far ahead.
She sent a kiss to the crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return, which sometimes seemed to be a question.
With regard to Bailes, the 19-year-old virus tweet from the beginning of this week is now entirely new:
Police: 3 victims of the serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix for the past decade, sat in the car, spoke and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Alice's daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the sidewalk, the authorities said.
The perpetrator made about eight shots of the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hiding on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple murder was apparently not the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was available to one of the adult victims.
The representative of the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that he had fired investigators to check whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in the residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS branch, early this month.
The suspect was believed to have used several vehicles, including the black Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related to each other and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and ended later.
Liner, 31 years old, and Alice's daughter, Malia, were killed on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a report by the police on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup in half an hour before a three-hour murder, which they believe was the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the needles and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the fragments of the bullet out of the motor section.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's gonna get better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixievoto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund Microcephaly was the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixivoto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign it.
What's not really true is, of course, you're signing on this," she said.
She and her husband told Vincent that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were still doing it," said Pixiewto.
Edmund's walking through the halls.
Edmund didn't sit down and use it until he had three, and he hasn't spoken yet.
But it's slowing down.
He's on his way to the sidewalk and he's on his bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture that Edmund thought of for "please join me."
"We're learning his language of gestures," said Pixywto CBS News.
But not just the usual language of gestures — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a variety of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmunda, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as corn and zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Pixivot remembers emotional losses due to uncertain future.
I've always said what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I really didn't ask for a life-long forecast, because I don't expect someone really to tell me.
But Pixito has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zik.
It'll be better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods serve as a source of relief in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with even more sediments expected to appear above the state until Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards said that public officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already come to the affected income.
Mike Stile, a representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that high-water, boat and sandbag transport were being requested.
Styl said that only the arrival of Tanjipahoa had asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
Water safety remains in force until Saturday for most of the southern part of Louisiana.
The weather service stated in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could penetrate the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood-supply trip took place until Friday, as the rain continued to travel to the Mobila area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruzje and the Eimit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to establish a record of the flood levels in the past exits.
Synoptic Alex Krautmann said that both rivers could drown many houses in suburban areas near Baton-Ruz.
He also said that the flood that was going down at Assenshen's entrance was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly reach Lake Morp.
The Tikfo River, to hear the southern border of the Mississippi State in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescuers were still pushing people out of the Emith and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and belt were among those saved earlier on Friday next to Gloucester.
Hansford, 62 years of age, says that the Bever Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly at night.
He said another belt that lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to rise," said Hansford.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest flood she'd seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood was “quietly spreading”, as the rains continued, noting that officials were considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported a fall of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautman said the soil was oversaturated by rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from homes at the arrival of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, a CBS branch, reports that counsellor Tanjipahoa has told about 200 houses that are heated.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both are now being drowned.
The President of the arrival of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amyth and in the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the arrival of Tanjipahoa was closed by about two dozen streets because of the high water level, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in hopes that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to being a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the rainy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as heated on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.
Kate Touson, head of the shop Shopper Value Foods in Eimit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it's still flying on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "gun-killed", remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia
Police reported shooting at a 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia, recording a second shot at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The grandmother and grandfather of the child introduced him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown had many gunshot wounds, including his breath, leg, hand, and life, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was pulled out by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melandez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to be repaired.
He had to go to the first class at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown.
They also shot three men, two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-olds is reported to be critical; two other victims have been registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be gunmen.
The investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a shooting between several armed people.
The semi-automatic arms cylinders attributed to the various copies of the semi-automatic weapons have made the place of action possible.
It seems that this was certainly a long battle.
There were bricks on the street, on both sides of the side of the road.
Therefore, it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," said Captain Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Station.
Many homes and cars in the area have also been hit.
There were no arrests, and the police reportedly watched video cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crazy bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Lori?
That's what I call a female Olympic gymnasium this year and for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasiums in this collection: Simon Biels, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Ernandes, who have inspired so many blind girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this type of sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast had been an African American number.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the past Gabby Douglas Olympics was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed.
The world could now be a witness to the incredible performances of the three-time World Championship of Simon Byles, Douglas and Lori Ernandes, performing unexpected but yet virtual gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American order to win gold in a woman's individual absolute primacy.
And a colleague at the Eli Reeseman meeting made silver.
We are witnessing this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like it in the gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Lori all chose the same path as Ellie and Madison to teach the Olympics.
They are the “final five” because the next Olympic gymnasium will have only four gymnasiums in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's training.
But gymnastics is actually expensive sport, and gymnastics are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, which are supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competitions, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gym clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasiums receive everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnasium families.
Amy Burman, coach Simona Bailes, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Ernandes, have both been training their gymnastics since they took up high school.
We need to create a more affordable and accessible gymnastics education by the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and affordable gymnastics courses in Harlem for more than 15,000 young urban children (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnasty develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability for nurturing, discipline and endurance for the mind.
This combination has a positive effect on good health, success in school and work throughout the life of the world.
It is this congregation’s inspiration that motivates thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that is wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors took notice of further attacks following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on the change by agreeing with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, said that NHS had been on “landless” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in nighttime work and out-of-the-place services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee on Young Doctors, BMA, said last night in a statement: “The young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is undermining the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors.”
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors would be transferred to a new contract, necessary progress and time of departure.
The WMA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met with an unwillingness to act and sometimes with full silence by the Government.
And this is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Huntou needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of young doctors.
If he doesn't, then the younger doctors are sure that they're ready to make the follow-up.
At the end of April, about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurse receipts were delayed, while nurses and consultants were involved in ensuring that doctors were replaced by pickets.
The Ministers hoped to end the dispute on the change by agreeing a revised treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for 54,000 young doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, urged younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The jokes are reaching little or nothing but exerting pressure on those already working at the edge of the team and services, causing concern, physical pain and distress to patients, seats and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Young Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine, were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
Preparations of £2 per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are expected to take advantage of the preparation of £2 per day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for longer periods of time.
The anti-inflammatory agent, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of re-infection for people with heart disease.
The product has already been appointed for 12 months after a heart attack, a reduced risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has now advised that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack will take place with about 140,000 people in England each year, and another attack or stroke occurs in the fourth.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the arterial walls and the formation of blisters.
If the bulb breaks into parts, it can cause a clot blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it can move around the bloodstream and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing stroke.
People who have already been attacked are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilice, reduces the risk by making the drums less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the existence of effective methods of secondary prevention, about four people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In advance of the recommendation of the ticagrellor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since the information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for this period.
The culture of ownership of the PC enables the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex Mayor Tauer Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, as a result of the Government's report
The culture of political correctness had closed its eyes, which had turned into a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in the Muslim communities, according to information from the Government ' s devastating report published today.
The former member of the Cabinet of Ministers, Sir Eric Pickles, is being criticized by the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of election violations due to “excessive sensitivity to raciality and religion”.
The former Secretary of Local Communities, now the Anti-Corruption King, reported that the fear of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police had to be allowed to set borders outside the polling stations to protect the fearsome voters.
He proposes that voters take identity certificates to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters must only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests wearing unwashed ink on people's fingers when they submit their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
There is a need to provide better protection for educators, said Sir Eric.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered at Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Court, which was considering elections, decided that the current Mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office in connection with a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “scenely discredited” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had caused his critics to be silenced, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "has carried out his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of a person ' s characterization when a person was voting, in the presence of someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about the fraud by sending an e-mail in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a few recommendations to clear the voting system, including the requirement to give his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report stated: “The evidence of the pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, was presented to vote in favour of seniors, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes on such conduct because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from work with mail ballots to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report also calls for rigorous checks on registration to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require the voter to submit an identity certificate before the vote.
Use unwashed ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year limitation on applications for automatic mail voting.
Remove political parties and activists from work with filled front votes and postal ballots.
To empower the police to establish boundaries around the polling stations.
To amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation in accordance with the Presentation of the People's Act of 1983.
Take illegal photographs at polling stations.
To require only English to be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff forces voters to go to the booth at once.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that it is "defeated", that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
“The electoral court has disqualified Lutfur Rakhman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticises the unrelenting “checks for the branch” of the electoral division of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The previous ruling of the court in Tower Hamlet was a signal to be heard.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and the worrying and secret spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Conscious of Kate's bicycle analogue and other two famous Olympics in Rio
The 2016 Olympic Fantasies in Rio this week came to mind by French biker Paulin Ferran-Prevo, who seemed to look impressive like the Cambridge Duchess.
But the 24-year-old participant in the Olympic Games is far from the only sport that is fighting for gold this summer, which can boast of its own famous double — at least in social media.
Thus, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. men's team Brady Allison, left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the two-wheeled Kate, many people have rushed online to point out how a certain sailor could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. men's team, Brady Allison, was the cause of a twitter hurricane, after his pictures appeared that looked like a freaking wolf star with Wall Street.
And in fact, the janitor learned about the insanity of the soccessors and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a huge similarity, it could be except vegetation on the face," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be mentioned even more this year: the striking similarity between the British port of Greg Zizerford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Ali Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be a true copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Stefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg, they've been comparing with the star of Hor Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to the most unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the "sport version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy holes and losses.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimov, can boast not only of burned skin and bright hair but also of AnnaLinn McCord's actress, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, is like Joseph Gorgon Levitt's "sportual version".
Cruel Women: The Hope Solo football star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same shape of face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why the couple's appearance is similar
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to announce his rumor that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical".
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress are incredibly similar to the shape of the face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Lori Linnie, as well as the winning golden medal for Gabby Douglas, which can be admired by its own beautiful wide smile, which resembles the star smile "Getting to Success" Gabriel Union.
Olympiad's CBC commentator apologized for saying that the Chinese swimmer was "dead like a pig"
Byron McDonald's fourth-place analysis at the final 14-year-old Ay Janhan at the women's esophagus 4x200 m in the middle of CBC's direct broadcast of the Olympics
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like him” and “dead like a pig” during the flood.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female esophagus 4x200 m in free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was attracted to the CBC's commentaries to "split her colour," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman has been throwing a ball, baby."
Too excited, she started like her, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The 14 - year - old Chinese sailor Ay Yanhan sailed the second stage of the esophagus at 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to withdraw from China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly to the network after being shocked by the tone and the expressions used
Emmet McFallain tweeted, "Is actually CBC's dictator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'dead like a pig'?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Yahan from China at the women's esophagus 4x200 m in free style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl has given up a ball, baby."
Criticism in Twitter immediately broke into Byron McDonald, and many called for him to be fired.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Nothing about herself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a racist bitch. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was taking over the CBC, apologized for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment on the navigational performance.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
The SBI concluded that more than 90 people had apologized in response to this statement.
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to MacDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The body also hurried to apologise and to issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed into the air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologise to our viewers in the direct atmosphere and to our subscribers in the neighborhood.
Let us make it clear that the Beyron's comments were about the sailor's speech, not about her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized in a direct atmosphere and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's esophagus,' he said on the release of the Olympic Games on CBC.
'I was talking about a swimmer's speech, not about her personally.'
'Of course, no disrespect was meant, and I'm very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who had been quietly following the lower white in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman found out to look at the truffles on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
What's worse, she's like she looked at them, she's rocking them, and she's putting them back on the counter.
She continued her search and eventually killed four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston.
The Primark Store of Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Folxton, where a woman used t-shirts to illustrate them before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of the two children Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after the example of the lower white, the mysterious woman “went out of the store again and bought nothing.”
She said: "The people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the storeroom, she took a couple of truffles from a glass, took off her own truffles and truffles and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere else to do it -- she was just standing there, staring at me."
"They all got up when she took off the trousers again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the counter."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she would like to wear and go out again.
"It doesn't look like she's worried about who's been watching her, or that she's thinking about the man who eventually bought the rabbits she was looking at."
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said, "How do you think someone's going to take the house of a rabbit that someone else was wearing, and they weren't killed?"
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale once they had left, but better."
"I don't want to come home with a new couple of women's rabbits and find out that the other woman was hoping and shooting them, and they weren't fired."
The representative of Primark reported: "Prmark knows about the incident that happened in our store in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods concerned were taken from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks Using Cow
The environment is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizraci, the mayor of the Cow Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with the armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether they come to you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the kidnapper himself.
If they approach the back, says Misraza, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and get rid of the line of fire.
Then you firmly bend the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free bow.
Then put your knees in the breath, and as the attacker bends out of the pain, you shake the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face and walk back, holding the gun on him.
To the armed, fit forward, the way you do it looks like you're taking your body off the line of fire, grab the gun quickly and pull it out so that the villains can't shoot.
At the same time, move the gun and hit the ball in the chest, then pull the gun out of its grip before you go back and aim at it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how that's what Misrazzi does.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery — if you're not a master of cattle — is to give up your cash.
Traveler Jan Wright leads his language to the most filthy places in Europe
The British traveller has undergone a serious test of his immune system and a corrosive reflex, licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The leading and author of the travel book, Jan Wright, 51, from Sapholka, translated the euro banknote, the Perils of Circ Piccadilla, the train wash button and the Russian public phone to prove the validity of his immune system.
Before approaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going through.
But the experiment, which should become a film called the Guide to the Internal Force of the Traveller-Lizun, produced some surprising results.
The thought of licking the spray button on a train that is used by thousands of others may be extremely repulsive, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen oven.
During the entire trip across Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase in rain bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the wounded brought him any more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright was known for his tests on the strength of his umbrella, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public beads on the werewolves to the Unitaza wiper button, this task undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, 'From childhood, I was completely carefree about my health, and I poured a lot of stuff out of my mouth, eating worms and dirty water.'
Of course, he proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test brain demonstrated the value of a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60
Wright and the Finnish producer of Valio dairy products filmed a film about a traveler entitled “The Guide to Internal Force Traveller-Lizuna”, which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the movie, he said, "This is close to one of the worst things I've ever smoked in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything 'cause it's embarrassing.
The Guide to Internal Force Traveller-Lizuna was taken together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided to Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygenated bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help speed up the growth of rainy human bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for breakfasts, juices and new categories Niko Voorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the wallet is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the caterpillar and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the wallet is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about this in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say that I would lose respect for John if he had lost some of the things I asked for, for example, a disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things made Jan easy to get close to, and some were rather harsh.
I'm glad that some of these slips we've been able to sleep on the floor.'
During a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen bacteria exclusively to good stomach and bladder status, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The family of the huligans destroyed Saltash, the town house of Cornwall, before eviction
The Huiligans left their municipal house with a loss of £50,000 after being evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced out of the property, the shocked housing-construction officers found the property in a condition requiring repair.
The walls were left with eating holes, half opened, the garbage was scattered across the floor, and the graffiti were dug.
The family is now moved and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a resident of Cornwall Houseing, said she's afraid he won't be saved.
She said, 'That was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed down, because this property will probably be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys stupid glory, and their name is called stupid glory.
Couples of three children who lived in real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the family's horror empire included street dragons with baseball bats, intimidation of the inhabitants of neighboring areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, disputes and abuse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In a few rooms of the house that could be taken down, there was an old trash.
Sex sheets in the house where drugs were sold in the past were removed
Neighbors say they saw dragons on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner to leave the house this week after they had been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into an essential hell.
One said, 'They didn't care.'
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is amazing.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we didn't get used to it!
Now that they've finally left, it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police and regularly called the police
Musor and old toys were thrown down on the left side of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a disgrace that the lessor was unable to take any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, since eviction is always the last method of action to be considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, since conduct was borderline and their actions must have been horrifying to her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at the same time, but he said they all had a little more 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedroom after eviction
Dwelling workers will now have to remove the garbage chest that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police conducted a search in the house and found more than 70 g of rope, as well as weights, related supplies and £1700 cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She said that the money went to the funeral for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After making them homeless, it is known that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms at home were carved out of graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall police, said that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
She said, "This message is for those who feel that they can do it without being accused of it, as well as for those who are harmed by it."
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low - flying military plane barely touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to take care of the sun were terrified of their lives
P-3C Orion P-3C Orion Air Force Portugal flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight, but insisted on the lack of security risks
That's when the frightened tourists start panicking, while the low - flying plane is hovering over the overcrowded beach.
A military aircraft flying from the sands of Aveiro, northern Portugal, is seen on dramatic scenes.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became conscious of the noise of the aircraft's engines, but could not see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few resters who posted a video of a shocking fall in social networks, said, "He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment when it was shown that he would break up."
Nuno Arroja added, "I've been working on a serfing, and I swear, it felt like a plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane showed up from the fog and flew at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of P-3C Orion conducted a training flight to locate fishing vessels by the coast, and had to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by the smoke from nearby burning forests, but the military forces insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — heavy fog and the power of forest fires, which had deteriorated visibility
The aircraft was operated by a coach and the pilot was ordered to locate fishing boats within the scope of the mission
The HASP system has been mandatory for more than a year for the general survey, but most of the coffee and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are increasing, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP) is a risk analysis and critical control points - a requirement for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of survey in Russia, as members of the Customs Union (TS).
Checks by Rossubennadzor for compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But as long as the officials write fines only for certain violations of the rules (see "Documents "...).
In general, the failure to comply with the regulation will result in an enterprise of 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASP, as a system that took into account the risks and prevention of food, was devised in the United States in the 1960s.
That's when it came to food safety for astronauts.
The system is now being used not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on TC.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the 2011 TC regulation).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food and not to restaurants, as explained by the head of the Public Council of Elena Ceretel.
Now everyone's trying to get lost.
The expected deadline for the resumption of charter trips to Turkey - at the end of August - is beginning in September.
But they won't challenge the curious question, because their target audience -- family with children -- is already ready for school, experts say.
Yesterday, the Alliance of Tourist Agencies sent a letter to the Government requesting the permission of the charters.
“For many Russian tourists, the choice of quality and affordable sea rest is unresolved, as the resorts of the Krasnodar Region and the Republic of Crimea have already been banned until the end of September”, notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of charters in August does not significantly affect the already demand for Russian sea tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union for Tourism (RST), if Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected for a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are renewed until now, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the shipowners are operationally designing the programmes and agree with airlines on ships," said Pavel Romanians, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, it is possible to renew charters - good news, but not too much impact on market power, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from retirement and are preparing for school or taking vacations in other countries.
Travelers and couples usually buy tours during the summer season.
Charter programmes can rely on those who have the opportunity to self-retirement," said Pavel Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it will now offer very budget proposals -- 50-60 thousand rubles for two tours, because there are people who are looking forward to very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosental, Director General of Optio-Travel Tourism.
Otherwise, it is precisely not worth counting on the accommodation - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Romanians also believe that since there is a demand for regular trips to Turkey, charters will also be demanded, but it is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey the launch of charters now is a repetition of the next season," said Pavel Romanians.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubcova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NDFL provided for by law from compensation within the limits of approved standards relating to damages caused by injury or other health damage.
The issue of milk to workers working under poor working conditions is provided for in article 222 TC RF.
However, the rules and conditions of extradition are laid down by the Order of the Russian Minority of 16.02.2009 No. 45.
According to this document, the free issue of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the availability at the workplace of harmful production factors.
On the basis of those standards, the Russian FNSF concluded in the letter under review that, on the basis of paragraph 2(3), 217 of the FNR, the FNR is exempt from the NDFL income in the form of milk value issued to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Standards and the conditions approved by the Order of the Russian Minorization of 16.02.2009 No. 45h.
The Moscow Gastrobank had no license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the licence to conduct banking operations with the credit organization of the Shareholder Commercial Bank “GAZSTROIBANK”, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AKB GAZSTROIBANK conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of cash in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable representation of the value of the assets of the bank have led to a credit institution having the basis for the implementation of anti-fraud measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank until the date of appointment to the competition manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
AKB “GAZSTROIBANK” is a member of the investment insurance system.
We recall that the payment of insurance to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ on the Insurance of the Deposits of Natural Persons in the Banks of the Russian Federation, provides for a 100% balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million dollars in total per investor.
Payments by the Deposit Insurance Agency will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, 335 seats in the RF banking system were held on 1 August 2016 by AKB 'GAZSTROIBANK ' s assets.
London School, which joined IGIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Counsel Tasnim Akunji said that her family learned about her death in Rhaka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was supposed to have died of a Russian air strike in Rakka, a riot in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all of this is the funeral and the will of others, that it is the risks involved in the war zone to persuade people ever to make the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015 Sultan and two other students from eastern London were seated on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she married a warrior IGIL in Syria and had become a widow for several months.
Reid claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democratic Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he was elected President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's approval, and as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Mitch McConnell Senate said that the next president would choose the person who could replace the last judge of the Supreme Court of Antonine Scalia.
Reed said Thursday at the conference, that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland with some confidence.
Representative Reed later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to raise Garland and just make assumptions.
He commended Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "break the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States District Court of Appeal.
Reed said that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "approachers" and "persons" of the Republican candidate in the presidents of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treatments states that erotic calendars for 'women, as well as for men '
The treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of being famous, they are aimed at finding the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of modeled models is different from old-fashioned Playboys, because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to go back to the demonstration of the eternal and classical encumbered figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women would like to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can take photos online or on open castins in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will have memories of unfavourable Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memorial that will tell us how not to become a victim of the Internet store.
This was reported in Rossubnadzer, M24 writes.
It is reported that agency experts are preparing a memory that will help citizens to choose the Internet and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The brochure contains several sections.
These will be common information and legislation, rules on the delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legal rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make a claim and so on," said Rossubnadzor.
The memory is now being processed.
Later, it will be posted on the Ros-Usanguard site in Moscow, also planned to issue a printed version and distribute to the Moscows.
The Russian MID issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of a diversion in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who assist in the preparation of terrorist acts are detained.
Among them are Panov Evgenien Aleksandrovich and Zachai Andrei Romanovic.
"They all give confessions," says the report.
The former resident of the Zaporoz area of Evgenien Panov, who had been detained for suspected terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt for questioning.
FAS spends 438 million rubles on Google.
The Russian Federal Antitrust Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on the Google corporation of 438 million rubles, says the Agency's website.
"The Google fine for violating antitrust legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the penalty soon," said Deputy Head of FAS Alexei Dozenko.
During the FAS investigation, it was found that Google provided smartphone manufacturers sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that other corporate apps would be installed on the device.
These include a search system that should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the “Protection of Competition” (dominant abuse).
We are confident that compliance with the prescription will enable competition on the mobile PV market in Russia to be developed, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act needs to be complied with by all companies whose products are placed on the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," said the head of the Communications and Information Management Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The report suspects 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide".
The New Book Shop Network is fined for selling the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rossubnadzár, without specifying the fine, the text of the book can be seen as “provocative or motivated by the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products to children and decided to impose a fine in the form of a seizure of 49 copies of the printed product arrested by the administration of Rosusenas.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores were carrying out checks on the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow, there will be an evening of memories of the Unknown.
In Moscow, there will be an evening of memories of an unknown sculptor named Ernst TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Litersaries.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their homeland," the Russian Jewish Congress said in a press service.
There it was pointed out that it was important to the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
In the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including Evgenien Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, GMI President Puškin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovski, and Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinski, Head of Moscow Culture Department Aleksandr Kibovski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechtnik.
It was previously reported that the family members of the Unknown were planning to have a panchiod on a sculpture in New York by 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty of: who actually buys the plastics?
Single middle-aged men love guilt.
And as long as you haven't given up on a section of comments with cruel insults under the alias of NesseUniversity MenAverage, this statement comes from actual data.
According to YouGov, the so much debated recovery of the plastics is not due to a boom in the two-thousand generation, which wants to penetrate a new material object, but rather to the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who recently bought a wine album c most likely range from 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
This is also not just an act of love gathering; it is emotional: older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings in their own hands (56%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking across the centre of Soho's relived street, in a modest, serene suit, and very much justifiable before the stop, laying hands and saying something exciting, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly waving away its charms and fats — hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops have now filled the buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several musical shops with fantastic specialists remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I am close to different people in some of these stores and try to evaluate their age and emotional mood with observation.
Glazgo Stuart, 55 years of age for which I went from Sister Ray (dataset: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (dataset: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years of age) in London on the afternoon to meet, and walk around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 bottles.
These plastics shown above (he sent me images by e-mail, I didn't chase him home), go along the walls of his guest.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy plastics that he could not afford when they only went out and buy the items he sold when he was young and on canvas.
"Many of what I get is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12 things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plastics are probably inverters who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Wez, aged 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the profile of YouGov.
However, he noted a new wave of people affected by the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people were released from their collection, usually about 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their own to buy a compact disk now sell their compact disks to buy their plastics," he says.
This can explain the boom among the rebirth factors due to a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plastics?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store, such as Phonica, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wezza, some senior clients, in particular, are being abused by a non-profit payment system.
Some wine lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to be removed from the familiar envelopes for plastics that evoke memories of unmistakable youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling the void or having material things as a kind of calming," says Wez.
Since I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers," said a colleague from the plastics store.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the wine album last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player that they never used, while 7 per cent of those who bought the bottles did not have a player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously tasked at landing with Bosano’s collectors.
The trophy aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42 years old who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead, so we can put it in the counter," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely going to happen.
More composition, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
These are younger people who are not older, with a little less than twenty who only know about it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost all the floors of the wine, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There's a couple of 70 tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less forced than in the above-mentioned shops — the latest synth and sex pop Wild Beast, not the jasper improvisation — it is pleasant to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a painful psychological trauma in 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, was walking around Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various plastics available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not the money.
She did not make much, she said, so collecting the plastics was not an appropriate option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or another device - just, but beauty has been guilty - it's ..." - it's loaded into dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unrecorded.
My last stop was a shop, which was said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers, the city’s fashions.
As long as I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at ginsy wearing shorts, I'm looking at a group of teenage girls, every minute they gather around the Polaroid Chamber, before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the player Crosley.
On the left is a staircase with a wall with plastics of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhaus and Flitwood Mac: modern style mix and classics, mandatory plastics for any medium collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are just ornaments — some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "poisonous guilt."
But given that any attraction to these objects could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho depth for some time, almost nothing to complain about.
It is no wonder that a population that is more likely than most has more time and money than most is the one that spends most of the money on brighter objects, such as guilt.
But as long as my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they do not rule out the existence of a large number of women collectors and lovers of wine that exist in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people may be working at school or at offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning on Thursday morning walking through the shops of plastics on Berwick Street, passing plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who writes on the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland Polar Shark — The Longest Ring - Animal — Video Record
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the highest life span of all the planet's bellows.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying these sharks, says that the record placed a female from 272 to 512 years of age and five metres long.
The French court rejects the proposal to take a store to the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the proposal by the Kale authorities to remove dozens of self-employed shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to remove a total of 72 self-employed shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to buy or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents) or a simple fee for several euros in self-employed restaurants.
Kale Prefecture stated that these places should be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they bear fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups, told the court that shops and restaurants were vitally necessary, stating that free care offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing number of campers.
They said that separate shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lila Court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel 72 self-employed people, but stated that the problems of the Kala Prefecture were “entirely understood”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that baccales, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extreme tent conditions".
He said that spaces provided peaceful points for meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat was the Children ' s Book of Jungley at the camp, which worked for no benefit and offered 200 lunches a day, English and French courses and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying them to the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect their children's coffee.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are not more than eight years old”.
Two charitable institutions, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp had grown and exceeded 9,000 — the highest in all history — following a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-regions libraries invite young volunteers to get to know programmes.

Britain stops for silver in Regbi-7, after the Fiji Master Class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regby-7 was disrupted by Fiji's final stopover on Thursday evening, when they were completely torn down 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given the master-class to control the ball, scattering, retreating, supporting the game, running lines and a hard force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of silver — the third in Britain per day — and they were proud of their efforts at the first Regby 7 Olympic tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier that day, could return to have a negative impact on them at the finals.
But despite all this, Fiji has won the best team of 15 in this form.
This may be some comfort to Britain — but probably not — that at least one Britishman will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was some kind of trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost all of them.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is impressive.
Fiji began a great deal of fun with Britain’s attempts to catch the ball.
It was like hitting a moving bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up to 5-0 when Ocean Collinsau sank into the corner.
With four minutes at the time, Jerry Tuwa added another tachdoon on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to capture Mitchell kept Leon Nacarav from killing a third, but that only held Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resume and there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more major attempts to capture Britain and stormed the line to get a foothold.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji was born to play in Regby-7, while Britain still has a profession.
Which is quite the same.
The United Kingdom has made massive replacements for half the game, and they've got a Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good with the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuis went after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton picked up an attempt for Britain, made a tachdown at the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game took a long time on the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, waved flags, and danced on the benches.
It was not possible to admire Fiji's approach with full joy.
Mother William has decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last few seconds.
It sounded like a whistle, the Fijians fell, and Britain fell on the lawn, totally defeated.
Earlier that same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semifinal, and Britain passed South Africa a little bit in the tense semifinal of one attempt for each of them — the different British realization.
Kyle Brown pulls the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line and killed them under the beams in the second half.
The most recent attempt to capture Marcus Watson, a 15th brother from the command of England, Antony, has finally won a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning inspired to win a fierce coach fight against cancer
There won't be any more interesting gold on these games, and that's what it says.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning have found the added value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were wearing veils, the boat had three voices, the echo coach Robin Williams had always been as long as they pursued the second order of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in Britain's annals who reached such height.
Their superiority was absolute; at the end, it was their 39th invincible speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that the two shiny sportsmen on the surfaces with the elegance of the beads do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
After every gold battalion of ready hands that contribute to the growing victories that are important and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who had been diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your kind a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Three were lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the interseasonal season, keeping the time gap to a minimum if this could be a correct expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed a paycheck, so I needed a quick fix.
That was encouraging.
I was in the hospital and was walking around the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per time, although they were talking enough.
That's how it starts.
Grapefruit itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking about hearing more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own anxieties.
Stanning, captain of the artillery force serving in Afghanistan on his shoulders, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a bit of a crossroads, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much that means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be no one, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense pace that their competitors could never have met.
Even at the last 500 metres when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been through a lot.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important not to get in.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't expect fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get a good bite and get out and win this race we did.
Money will take a year to solve its future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own TV client, Steve Beckshol.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government extended the deadline for the destruction of authorized products
By the end of 2017, the Government had extended the time limit for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russia sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russian imports of certain agricultural products, commodities and foodstuffs from the United States, the countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, fruit, fruit and milk products were banned.
The use of food imported into the country under the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only about 100 tonnes of banned products were removed from the sale for the 1st quarter of 2016.
The hunt for "ban"
On Friday, rains and threats are expected in Moscow.
The capital region will face an atmospheric front that will bring precipitation and lower air temperature.
During the day, the air progresses to 25 degrees warm.
So, Saturday night in Moscow places will be a short-term rain, possible threats and wind cracks up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with storms and wind cracks up to 12-17 m/s.
As well as the weather is forecasted in the Orlov, Kursk and Voronez areas, Dni.ru reports.
For the next working week, the landings are unlikely.
The WTO Arbitration Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
"This is the first case where the WTO has taken a decision against the RF," says a communication on the official website of the organization.
However, the Arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
In turn, Russia promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to appeal to the World Trade Organization for Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times stated that the conduct of the United States in resolving disputes in WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the Euro Union and other WTO members for refusing to approve South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa for the second time.
Russia will therefore not address the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions against the RF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration has changed.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin moved to the President ' s administration and expressed hope that the new chapter of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he had begun in the post of President Ivanov ' s administration and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, the Reports said that experts considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of director of the administration of transparency and understanding and the relocation would not change anything in principle in the administration of Kremlin.
They note that the manager, who has worked in the President ' s administration for a long time, has effectively developed the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the deputy head of the administration of Anton Weino, a man who was well aware of the specificity of the work.
In Poland, they're saying they won't buy gas at Gazprom.
The Polish State oil company PGNIG does not rule out that a few years from the RF gas supply may become intractable to it due to the reorientation of fuels from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Polish Finance Company Vice-President Boguslav Majez.
His words are transmitted by the TASS.
"It can happen that we won't completely buy gas (Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines will become the East, a commodity from SMG terminals and Norway," said Maletz.
Gasprom is currently dominant in gas deliveries to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30 per cent higher in 2015.
The share of Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement rose to 49.8% compared to 40% earlier.
We recall that on 22 July, the Polish Antitrust Office did not agree to the establishment of a Gazproma Joint Undertaking and its European partners for the construction of the North Stream 2 pipeline.
Earlier this month, Poland had left a request for Gasprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas under the North Stream-2.
The Vice-Chairman of the holding government, Alexander Medvedev, said so.
The North Stream-2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction on its site is planned in autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish side to give up long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, said the Vice-President of the Board of Directors of Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent of the purchase of gas from the RF.
Gazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG itself made a statement to the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not yet mean that negotiations were terminated.
The Polish company had previously appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish Government ' s gas and energy infrastructure authority Petr Naimski reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government ' s gas and energy infrastructure authority, Petr Naimsky, stated that six years later, his country could renounce the supply of blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
The North Stream-2 provides for the construction of two marine gas pipeline lines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMI) has increased the number of observers around Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first SMM lockup in Ukraine, Alexander Hughes.
“I can confirm that the MMS has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, answering the relevant journalist question, transmits “RIA News”.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no security incidents.
Observers tracked the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video on the ground floor at Ufu airport of the Jak-42 passenger plane, which ran outside the landing strip 400 m and landed on the left wing.
The video was released by the 360 TV channel.
The CPC took place at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow.
KrasAvia flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place that was not affected.
Only the aircraft was transported to the station.
Ufya Airport works normally.
The privileged investigation management of the SCR was responsible for the severe landing of the liner aircraft.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the rebel areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that it has occurred undisputedly.
Such statements were made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the use of toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, was presented on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where the Russian military and transport helicopter had been bombed before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow the charges had been dropped.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakat Nur ad-Din al-Zinki.
Soon it became known that the two bombs started with toxic gas were two.
This was confirmed by the BBC as one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the smell of gas, began to warm my eyes, became difficult to breathe," quoted the reader.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of toxic gas is confirmed by experts, actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told journalists: “The evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is laid down in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CPCW).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of Syrian military chlorine against “measured opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the daily shooting of its areas, and terrorists prevent the city from getting out of town.
As Reuters reports, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in organizations is considered to be “not enough to help nearly 2 million peacekeepers in the hunt”.
Counsellor Staffan de Misturra de Humanitariane Jan Egelann said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to provide assistance and evacuation to the city from there of the sick and injured every week.
"We have to send abundant cargo from the colloquial trucks to places where the roads are almost destroyed and what remains are buried," said Mr. Egelann, but the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian break” continue in Geneva.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing fight against Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August that a three-hour cease-fire regime would be in place, which would operate every day starting on Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to ensure the conditions for delivery to the city of medicines, food and items of the first need.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken in the light of the increasing international pressure on Moscow to undertake military operations and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions in Thailand ' s resorts.
Immediately, several explosions broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, wounded 19.
The explosion was in the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four citizens of the four States, none of them Russians.
The responsibility for the incident had not yet been taken over by any terrorist groups, but the IMF had hurried to declare that Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been arrested for suspecting the organization of the explosion.
According to preliminary local police, the scale and specificities of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the warlording country.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including the Patong Beach in the Phucket area and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Following the arrival of the military junta in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that had demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, with 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects involved in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, reports Police Colonel Krisan Patana Charoen.
As early as possible, he added, but in the IMF countries “are convinced that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to make conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, actually it's local diversity, and we're trying to identify the personalities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the day of the birth of Queen Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai Hound considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Szysopacharoenrata, the bombs were bombed remotely in half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four deaths was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The personalities of the remaining victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them were German citizens, three were submitted to the Netherlands, two were Italians and Austrians.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, reports the Rosturism Press.
Local experts also link the explosions to the referendum of 7 August, in which 61.4% of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitutional Commission appointed by the military junta.
It was necessary to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper chamber of Parliament was fully appointed as military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Prussian army.
He said that the army had been driven by an ongoing political crisis and that there had been no progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military set up the National Peace and Order Council, introduced commandant hours and censorship, set fire to the protesting and upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok proved to be in an emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawatt in January 2014, announced the introduction of an emergency situation in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital.
The special regime was extended for 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the centre of Bangkok, at the Obeda Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, affecting 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions caused unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and have attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
There was a development of conditions in the Dry Log.
As “U” has become known, the Government is invited to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the Golden Landing of the Dry Log with the maintenance of two key limits.
The auction is proposed not to allow a company where 25 per cent and more are foreign nationals and those who do not have at least 25 per cent of the capital.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk for a complex and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
Minorities have introduced to the Government a draft order and conditions for the auction for the largest undeveloped gold settlement in Russia in the Suhay Log (Irkutian region, 130 million U.S. stocks and resources), reported two sources of “U”, known to the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, specifying one of them.
In Min nature, the project was confirmed by “U”, which was introduced into the Government.
The representative of the smoker's vice-premier Alexander Chloponina said "U," that the project had not yet been included in the official's machine.
“The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the Government has issued its order, and in view of the deadline for the collection of potential bids (at least 45 days) the tender may take place in October”, said Min naturea.
According to “U”, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the option that was sent to the ministries and FOIVAs in July (see “U”).
First, there is not less than 25% of happiness in the applicant's capital.
The second is a refusal to have access to an auction for companies under foreign investor control, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investment in strategic societies.
According to the two sections of the project, as already stated by "U" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent share and above) are not tax residents of the RF or have a double nationality may not be admitted to the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Dry Log is of federal importance (more than 50 tonnes of gold).
In Min nature, they confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on details before the Government.
The demand for participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk Region, said in December 2015 "U" in Min nature and later confirmed the governor of the Sergey Levchenko region, noting that it was sent to Min nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroshtenko, who had "agreements on investment projects with "Rostech".
Those who lobbyed for a restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interviewees "U" did not specify.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control over the largest place of gold in Russia in the background of Western sanctions," argues the interviewer "U", who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The chapter of the minor nature of Sergei Donski on 1 August stated that foreigners “can go to a consortium” if applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners”.
The “U” interviewers consider it unlikely that conditions will be adjusted in the Government.
The main claimant at the Dry Log in the industry is considered to be the consortium of the largest gold miner RF PAO “Polus”, the subsidiary son of Suleiman Kerimou Said, and “Rosteh”.
According to "U", in July, the partners created SL Gold, where "Pollus" had 51% share, and RT-GR was 49%.
In Rostehe, comments were dropped, in Polose, they said "U" that "uncertainly, interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of the conditions”, added Paulos.
ALROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision by the Government of the RF said the sources "E".
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "U", are not interested in the asset.
The head of the gold industry union of RF Sergei Kashuba evaluated "U" investment in the Suhow Log in $2.5-4 billion in December 2015.
The majority of potential applicants fear not only the amount of investment but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious survey of the stocks and technology of complex mines, and the interviewers explain "U" in the industry.
In the pension market, M&A, the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, launched a merger of four NPFs.
As a result, NPF will be established on the basis of the GasFond Pension Stockpiles of some 373 billion rubles.
To initiate the merger procedure of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promogrofund, Heritage and Gazfond Pension Stockpiles - yesterday, the owner of 100% of the OOO funds, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, reported.
“The reorganization is carried out by agreement with the CB in compliance with the requirement that the terms of the existing treaties should not deteriorate”, the company said.
The association is based on the GasFond Pension Stockpiles.
As noted by the Director General of the NPF, Oleg Bálošický, the Funding Association has a number of challenges: increasing the geographical presence, concentration of resources for development, cost reduction, allocation of best practices for each of the Funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative date for completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, GasFond Pension Stockpiles will become the largest player in the OSP market.
As at 31 March, the pension stock of the pooled funds amounted to more than 373 billion rubles.
As reported on the fund's website, the beneficiaries of their owner's “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled OOEs hold 65 per cent) and the Gazfund NPF (35%).
However, it was only the group that started the competition much later.
So, the O1 NPF sub-control group "The Future" was swallowed by "Stalfand" in the beginning of the current year.
The Joint NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
"Amalgamation into a single structure, in addition to cost reduction, is necessary to address structural challenges," notes NPF General Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also under way in the Sofmar pension group - the European, Education and Science and the Regional Fund - the Sofmar NPF should be involved by the end of the current year.
They will be joined by the Doverie NPF in 2017.
"The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs," noted the Sofmar pension group.
A break in the pool of funds supported by the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPF could not redeem more than 40 per cent of the amount of infrastructure bonds to which the group was actively deployed.
Following amendments to the decision of the CB in March of this year, there are no restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the whole issue can buy out one big game," says Yuri Nogin, director of the Akra Financial Institutions Rating Group.
Several top-15 NPF managers have called the separation of the sphere of influence and, as a result, staffing in a single fund that should have been agreed upon by the group ' s owners.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for commentaries.
At the request of "U" in the NPF, "Gasfond" was also not answered.
While the consolidation of the funds is a labour-intensive and non-economic activity, that decision will be justified at a long distance.
As Sergey Okolesnov, the Director General of the Consulting Company's Pension Partner, notes that the Gazfonda Pension Stockpiles are less liquid, accession will allow for the stabilization of the base of other group funds.
A more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promo-Fonda NPF will be sought in the construction of a variety of ODA sales, as well as the use of a more modern PB.
The CB's requirements for processes and NPF staff are constantly growing and therefore it is not appropriate to double the infrastructure on the four funds in a single investment policy, considered by the managing director of the Corporate Ratings Expert RA Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing duplication would clearly outweigh the possible costs of merger," notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of combining the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at 30-50 million rubles.
“The cost of maintaining the four funds of such sizes is approximately 400 million rubles a year, with the consolidation of the medium-term budget actually reducing twice,” said Mr. Okolesnov.
The best disco movie "Pit and his dragon" came out in the Russian script.
The beautiful types of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the fascinating story and the country-style song are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, Elena Kravcun.
The frightened little one improved the dragon, who became a human child and a tender little girl, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliot, honoring the dog from the story book, playing with him in the canoes and sleeping in the envelope.
Six years later, he, who had grown up and was in a straitjacket, was no longer distinguished from another purposeful forest stork, Mauglia.
In this way, Pete and discovered a red-haired woman named Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Gavin Brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, was aggressively ravaged by the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon but also help to save it.
Pete is a fast-tracked human being in the neighborhood of the idyllic Americans who wear cowboy dress, moral code in the heart and smile more blindly than in any advertisement.
No one looks or acts too horribly so that the viewer actually starts to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who was hunted down by a typical native of his own forests, was far from the wrong man.
The huge desert dragon also gained no fear, with a good buldogue, a wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
It's funny, it sucks, it's even moaning, and it doesn't say, because it's always wanted to starve it, so it's a good thing it's different from all the famous movie dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of behaviour ensure such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, not only small viewers but also adults begin to cry desperately.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figgli in the role of Pete, which breaks between a possible family and this other.
Robert Redford is virtually issuing a canonical grandfather who would like to have every child literally.
How did director David Laurie manage to take a fantastically sweet remike of the forgotten Disney movie Dragon Pitt in 1977, from the nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and play, and make it the most soul movie of this summer?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
In his painting, Laurie from the original, in fact, took only two things: the poor Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers and a lot of weird jokes left behind.
This good story reads the drawings from "Bambi", "Inoplanetian" and many other nice children's hearts.
Disney's studio continues to successfully expand the 21st century high-quality novel gallery.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as glamorous as the same book of jungles, and it doesn't have the experience of the evil that Kate Blanchett turned out to be a cat in the new Ensign.
But this naive film is still successful in helping to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magic castle The Disney director Laurie will get once again for the artistic film adaptation of the story of Peter Pene.

Journalist RBC Aleksandru Sokolova filed a new indictment
Journalist RBC lawyer Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor ' s office had found deficiencies in their defence.
That the prosecutor's office made such a presentation, we learned from investigators yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in the court meeting on the issue of limiting access to criminal proceedings, but the meeting did not take place, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office," said Mr. RBC, lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the Prosecutor ' s Office had advised investigators of the incompatibility of the case and of the collected material.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and submit a new indictment to Alexander Socolov.
Either the second article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear, or the same will remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dinze has clarified.
As reported by “U”, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the RBK journalist the wording of “disastering the political situation towards instability” and “disastering the power of illegal means”.
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, correspondent for Kommersanthobossport, lived at the Olympic Village, inspected the Russian Assembly House, lunched at the local table, and even passed the WADA test.
Life doesn't seem to last for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes need another half an hour or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, there is an unstoppable settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
By 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, as explained by the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igory Kazikov.
It's a hot water problem, so I'm sorry, it's an unitaze.
We've been fighting for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinics came in, but they were just rubbing some substance onto the sex, yes and everything.
They have sex, do you see any innovative ones?
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these fields, they're plain.
Overall, there's been a shift in the clinning company, and now it's okay.
The Olympic village is South Boutovo, a sleepy area surrounded by mountains on one side, with other inspiring reefs, with plenty of water.
Well, there's still a two-metre railway line across the perimeter, along which the machines are running.
The entire village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag hangs - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
Looking at a small foiege at the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that appear to be the most urgent for the national team.
There are two ads on the registration stand: "Please don't throw the paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "Prime in the gift badge.
The stand itself sinks into the booklets.
Their fun flower contrasts with the titles of the booklets: “Remembering infectious diseases for those travelling to Rio de Janeiro”, “First Aid for Melting, Inhalation, Loss of Consciousness, Cardiovascular Rejuvenation”, “First Assistance in Fire, Hot Hit, Breaks, and Bleeding”.
Text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by disease and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are expected to have a favorable outcome.
Of course, Russia has a health centre that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the home, including relaxing and sporting massage.
On the contrary, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
In line with the door, the inspiring poster "No matter what we win!"
Well, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear will believe in it.
Let us be less, the more the taste of victory, the more Russia will not retreat or break!
And for the further advancement of the Spirit, the proclamation is: "Brothers and sisters, by Allah's Way!
Under the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirill's spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympic Assembly of Russia is carried out by Andrei Vladimirovic Alexiev.
Ordering requests and other requirements on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Worship for All Confessions in the Village.
Well, Russian, you know, in a privileged position, they have their own watch.
With regard to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the ladder recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness he met the bodies on it.
It seems that these were the sleeping staff of a new clinning company.
I think at any point in time they've decided to take a quiet time on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expecting a meeting with a former acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovic Dubko, the coach of our Baptists, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the educator, European champion Jan Paulov, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're living on two beds, of course there's almost a touch, but it's not critical.
Sunzel's one on the four, but that's why it's spacious.
Schaff, of course, funny, from the fabric, trust doesn't cause, but something can be done.
"No, you're guessing they're out of tea!" said the tennis player Svetlan Kuznetz, who met me at the main table.
It is mainly called because it is an area of 2.7,000 sq.m. and is willing to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 pieces on the top of the mountain, absolutely free of charge.
The menu options are: "Fucker from Brazil", "Cooks of Peace", "Asian Watches" and "Pixie, Macron."
The last option, as I've seen, is that our volleyballers are very popular.
In addition, for example, I haven't found soup in any of the giant restaurants.
What kind of soup?
I'm glad I got Chinese with me, it's weird.
And a teapot.
But in general, for you to understand, we have even worse food on the map.
There's something you can choose from here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally picked fresh for couples and fried potatoes in tomato sauce.
Each dish has a table with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, admit it was edible.
I don't even know why this is always in the local McDonald's.
Wet, relaxed, warm sportsmen on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Diping Agency (WADA).
They're undermining a Victorian game whose winner gets a football.
They provoke, you can say!
To receive a gift, at least eight out of ten questions must be answered correctly.
There's questions in Russian! I've been attacked by a WAD girl.
But she didn't attack it.
That's what I did in a patriotic break, of course.
The situation has become worse on the second question: "If I have received notification of the Doping Control, should I immediately go to the Doping Control?"
I stopped at option B, "No, I've got one hour."
He's lost, so to speak, watchfulness.
He forgot that Wada's weak to expect is not coming.
In general, it has to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the Victorian situation, my situation became quite critical.
I had some reason to think that if I find it difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my fat schedule (and I think it's hard!), I can use bio additives to get “additional nutrients to improve my productivity”.
Ann no, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is that they do not categorically prohibit, but strongly, in a number of proposals.
It's not fair to play Wada!
How's it going, Russia?
To retreat somewhere behind Efimo, Isinbaeva and all of our secured team.
That's why I focused, and I won an accident football from the last forces.
You know what they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to a nearby fitness center.
I'm taking care of the coaches.
He hit 250.
Surprisingly, no Russian sportsman was found in this accumulation of running roads.
But maybe it's right?
Let him who can't play be trained!
And here's one of our guys sitting in the police station.
Right to the eyelid.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, like the whole village, anywhere else, hangs up the condoms.
On it is a summoning call went forth: "Make ready the couch."
All that remains is to roll the iron that reminds the handle of the door lock and the condom made from the Amazon natural latex is ready to come out of the machine.
I took myself alone, remember.
The sportsmen won't be there, they've taken 450,000.
A whole entertainment centre is available for holiday and holiday entertainment in the Olympic Village.
In addition, the International Olympic Committee has a number of ways to spend $3.25 million a day on sportsmen.
The centre is equipped with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What's that? - I'm interested in a company in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses a wild game.
Of course, I could just say that he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of a collection of Russia, yes and everything.
Here, by some strange faction, the eyes of the boys in yellow-blue.
The most playful collection is provided.
It takes at least three hours to walk around the village, looking at every corner of it.
But if you're walking, and not driving on electricians, you're also going to open up a house with a Canadian cabin with an entrance forest and a toilet, and a ticket office, and a washing machine, and a dry cleaner, and a parquet shop, and a flower shop, and a box with day-to-day consumer goods, and a mail with a unique brand (but you can't even sell a row from the Chinese philatists), and a bank, and a shop, and a photocosc.
And in the late evening, you'll be sitting next to an olive tree hanging out with colorful strips in memory of those who left this world with friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be accompanied by a machine that's irrevocably dripping fluid to kill the insects, thinking about forever.
It's about the Olympic movement.
That doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was hiding their breath, watching the Australians as they heard the U.S. Dream Team was not being punished, these patients went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglava won gold in the rapper at the XXXI Olympics was the first I got.
Maybe I'm even the only mosquito that's ever seen this happen without considering those who were watching the Carioca competition that night.
This can only be understood by the present patient.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors down below, as always at night, fall asleep and start screaming at each other in a bad way, but very loud.
And threatening to drive the furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy, as asked by the plumber, a new one.
There's nothing on the TV schedule, so he was just in control of the Match, the First, and in any case Russia, although it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, all sports are there for some reason.
It's where the serials are broadcast in the straight-air atmosphere.
Hope, of course, for Match, the whole night a young man screamed in news releases first about the great semifinal of Deriglav-Shanaeva, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of basketball, U.S.A. Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They've put the officers in place of their own great Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be an old one.
It's all right, but it's getting close to fighting De Francesco, and on the screen without any change.
I'm starting to read the channels in an easy panic.
That's the feeling, the second time they turn.
All right, let's go deep on the cables.
There's no "Mother" in any of the topics.
And, in my opinion, the fight will begin.
Text and tweeting of some sports sites don't bother me.
An unexpected but brilliant result comes from road surfing.
The “First” website provides direct technical transmission of all the competitions that are currently taking place.
I'm calling for a trap, I'm getting a single one for gold.
Deliglase is well-contracted, moving forward in the eye, and is clearly beginning to take time.
The Italian is playing almost all the time.
Our one-point forward, let's hear more than two seconds.
Di Francisca throws herself at Degliglazova, and retreats, and time runs out, and the Italian is indicted.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reported on the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first one to see it with my own eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the partisans.
Tatarstan's spiritual authority is refusing to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the prisoner DUM committed his subjects to preaching Friday only on Tatars to force young Tatars to "explor their native language".
The board states that it is “we do not in any case interfere” with the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani feels that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of people, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
We are afraid that their Tatar sermons will not reach the whole audience.
Yesterday, the prisoner DUM Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's mufti Camil Samigulin said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "explor their native language".
"For those who say "heavy" in every big mosque, we intend to organize the teaching of the Tatar language absolutely free of charge," said Mr. Samigulin.
He added that “the decision has already entered into force” and today in all mosques the sermons “must be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan is publishing the Shura magazine with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got a guy who doesn't say well enough in tatars, "maybe he'll be able to prepare well for it."
DUM Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand incomes in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, Russian was used primarily in a number of mosques in Kazani.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practised in the Burnaev mosque, Zacban and Eniller.
However, Mr. Muhammetshin stressed that the leadership was tasked with ensuring that all students had both the public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm can be done to a Muslim-netar," stressed Mr. Muhammetshin, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a mandatory, fundamental part of the Namas."
However, Namaz himself will continue to read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons will continue in the mosques in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhamethin said "U," that there was no serious threat that Tatar language could be extracted from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, it is reported that there is no use in the republic of the preaching work.
The DUM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the U.K.T. Col. Rinat Zakirov said "U" "Megeti is an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this area.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language “the desire of the Imams” but in the WCT's report, it is “counted to be correct”.
The requested “U” have those who preach in Russian are willing to comply with the DUM decision, but they believe that there will be difficulties with the understanding of the priests.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course they'll be sad.
"There's a need to rebuild," says the Burnaev mosque of Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer to even many Tatars, because "Russian in schools and in children's gardens, on the radio - where it was originally".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language, which are held on other days.
We put our trust in God.
God will bring about the end of this state of affairs."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
It's Uzbek and Tajik and Azerbaijani.
A lot of foreign students are coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," says I.
He believes that in Tatar language the sermons will “come to a narrower circle and not to the whole audience.”
But we will obey the decision of the prisoner.
Just the result of the preaching will be a different one.
But time will show.
"I will, for example, only be easier because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdulla Galliullin.
Former Director of FSIN was transferred to court
The Prosecutor ' s Office of Moscow has passed an indictment on the investigation of the CSU of the CRC on the seizure of the budget allocated to the needs of the Russian FSIN.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who had damaged the FSIN by more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The Office of the Chief Prosecutor sent a criminal case to the Zamoskorice judgment with respect to former Director FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, and Director of the FGUP “The Centre for Information and Communications of the Federal Enforcement Service of Penalties” (FGUP CITOS) Victor DeDefinenova.
Depending on the role and extent of participation in the crime, they are accused of the CSU of the FMR on Moscow under section 3, 285 of the FMR (post abuse, which has serious consequences), section 4, and section 159 of the FMR (a fraud committed using its status as an organized group, particularly large).
In addition, Crivolapov is accused of under article 1, section 222 of the RF (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CRC, in 2010-2012, the individuals involved were fraudulently abducted from the public prison budgets allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems of the sub-controllers, so-called electronic compasses.
In order to steal the budget, the group developed a scheme under which the CITOS FGP subsidiary, which had concluded the relevant public contracts, carried out control and oversight techniques, including electronic braceletes, and implemented several times higher prices.
Although CITOS had no production equipment, buildings, facilities for the installation of production capacities to create the final cycle of production of electronic braceletes, between them and FSIN Russia had five gas contracts of more than 3.3 billion dollars.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found in the Samar branch accounts, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
As a result, over 140 million dollars of money was personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office by one of the partners for whom a criminal case had been handed down in separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machining, found an unknown origin of the patron to the award gun, allowing him to be charged with an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 vol.s., the accused was charged with a claim for damages of 2.7 billion rubles.
The Hakan Shuquur football player is suspected of involvement in the track.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of the Hakan Sukure Parliament and searched his family's two houses.
The 1990s Turkish football star, the beginning of the 2000s, attacked by Hakan Sukuur, was being searched by the country's authorities for a coup d'état that happened last month.
Forvard, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to the “armed terrorist group”.
The Hizmet movement is a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition leader Fethulla Gulen.
It was his President Erdogan who considered himself the organizer of a military coup attempt on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
According to local media, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Sukure, and the police have already searched two homes belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gulen joined his father in addition to Hakan Sukura himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his closest associates proved to be there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
Hakan Shuquur, a football player, protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and spoke for the country of assembly.
He spent most of his career in Galatasarae.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he did not spend more than one season in either.
Hakan Sukuur is still the most effective collector of Turkey: in his assets, 112 fighters for the national team and 51 soldiers killed.
In 2013, Hakan Sukuur left his post as a deputy because of an ongoing corruption investigation into the Erdogan party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant for at least 42 journalists was issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of promoting military revolutions and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media staff can expect long prison terms from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Conchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas only for national films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for a Russian film, with tickets worth 2-3 times less than for foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood bands.
We have over 100 pictures per year in the country, of which the screens are on average 20-25 tapes.
"And it's even very difficult for them to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, in which huge budgets are being set up," said the film director.
Remember, on July 1 in Crimea, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began work.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian areas from all over Russia and from a number of countries abroad.

Former Deputy Governor Nikolai Sandaków Konstantin Akulić, detained in Miasse (Chelabine Region).
According to U-South Ural, another accused lawyer, Sergey Kolosovski, Constantine Akulich, today has been summoned to the investigation department of the Miyass SCR to file an annual case of execution.
Konstantin Akulić then went to the DTP as a lawyer for the assistance of one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated against unidentified persons, and now that he started protecting Nikolai Sandaków, it turns out it was Akulic," says Sergei Kolosovski.
Constantine Akulic became a former deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
In the meantime, half an hour before the call of a lawyer at the Miyass SCR, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to be informed of the case of fraud in which Nikolai Sandakow was accused.

The Russian Honey Company (RMC) is prepared to take on social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the CMC has taken over the modernization of one of the country's oldest and most environmentally " bad" enterprises, the Carabakh Meadow.
The Karabash Meadow plant was founded by an English shareholder company in the head of Leslie Urkvart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was important to the economy of the country, and it actually ensured the survival of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, because of financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabasha.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Carabas medivoire.
It was also necessary to address one of the major environmental problems of the Karabakh plant.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had been sadly known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company had become the head of the Russian Honey Company.
The company began to modernize production, gradually reducing environmental pressures on the environment.
This was also noted recently by the Governor of the Chelabinian Region, Boris Dubrovski, who visited the first July Carabakhmedh.
The South Ural Chapter called the major changes that have taken place with the company since the Carabakhmedh joined the RMK group.
The main activity of modernizing Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sero-xyllium engine to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Honey Company, the amount of investment in the project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karabashmedź system is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners, the gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion dollars.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new one billion rubles of industrial goods.
In turn, taxes on the city ' s budget will also increase.
During the entire period of implementation of the Tominian CCA project - from the beginning of construction and before the second phase - the federal penalty will be 8.9 billion dollars.
After the entry into operation of the CCA, the revenue from the budgets at all levels may amount to 80.9 billion dollars.
For the year of production in the Varnen region, there are 346.3 million rubles in budgets at various levels.
And this is the first year.
"The more successful the company is, the more payments can be," added Valerie Ulanovski.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Mikeev KHOA came close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of CMC enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
CMCs help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and entertainment facilities, and to maintain the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Honey Company in Karabasha became a capital renovation, and in fact, it is almost complete child restructuring of N9 to 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of RMC Arenas are a landscape park with artificial mud, underground and underground parking for 600 machinery, coffee and sports shops.
The RMC Arena will allow the conduct of mature professional sports events at the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make exercise in physics and sport in comfortable conditions accessible to the inhabitants of Chelabinsk, especially for children.

WSJ: The United States is considering the imposition of sanctions against RF because of the violations of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of the Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
It is reported that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration will have to officially charge the Russian servers with an attack or supported by Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. special services are almost convinced of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that it is usually the United States that prefers not to mention specifically those who are involved in the hacker attacks.
The exception consists of a breach of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially entrusted to the PRC in 2014.
However, in the past year, Obama issued an order simplifying the system of sanctions for those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials had found that the hackers had acted with Russia ' s support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether it is so serious that it can exacerbate tension in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration was allowing sanctions against States whose hackers had broken down servers of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic census of the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in a robbery.
In Kremlin, such communications were called absurd.
FAS punished Google almost half a billion rubles
There has been a distortion of competition in the mobile app market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated on the initiative of the Index.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers access to Android components under conditions that prohibited applications from other developers, in particular from the Index.
FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company had abused the dominant position on the market and had imposed on mobile devices manufacturers the installation together with the Google Play store of other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, informed FAS leader Alexei Dozenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.

In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and then determine with further actions: to implement it or to challenge it.

However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the agency have been in judicial proceedings.
In FAS, it was noted that despite a fine, Google was discussing the possibility of concluding a world agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This is what Ehu Moscow, a leading analyst in the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin, expressed.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime effect Snapchat criticises as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by the spirit, but some doubters say it is racially unstable.
With the Linza Snapchat tool, approximately 150 million users are allowed to change the validity and play with individual ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a character to paint a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are gross, distorting lines of instruments that create more than 30 million self - adjusted.
Any mistakes quickly become widely known.
Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraged the whited persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth and cheeky cheeks, some critics considered it racist cartoonism in Asians, yellowish.
And they asked whether these recurring contradictions indicated a more serious problem for a company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, communications were spread and then mishaps were reported on The Verge and Motherboard, the next day after Snapchat was declared to have removed this function.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a respect for the souls of the soul, not as an Asian cartoon.
But experts who know about racism are not really listening, the lens has been reminded of offensive stereotypes in effect.
Others rejected a complete comparison with the soul.
In his e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student of art, whose tweets about the photos were actively shared, said that the lens was “painting and at least uncomfortable”.
She added that “it was difficult to argue with the very rough side of the painting on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowing, it is mostly destructive yellowing.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the ladies we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katy Ju, "it's much more difficult to remain undetected than it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and the engineer working on the Medium, decided to delete her account in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were due to insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snepchate.
Ju has criticised mainly the company's white leadership, which is made up of only men and has finished her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Ju, who is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "Or they did not have enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they did not have white people, but they did not hold positions that could be safely and openly expressed."
Other doubters share her view by expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to a trusted person, the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on insufficiently represented sections of the population and on active efforts to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to tell them that they won't do it."
Military leadership has violated IGIL investigations, the Congress Commission reports
Officers of the Central Command of the United States Armed Forces have modified their intelligence records to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than given the basis for the on-the-spot events, the Congress Commission reported on Thursday ' s report.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Chairmen of the Committee of Representatives of the House of Commons, the Committee of Inquiry and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, found “ widespread dissatisfaction” among analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service, who claimed that the managers had conducted their assessments of American actions aimed at victory over the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military administration in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents confirmed by the Centcoma High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than is confirmed by real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services,” said a news release dedicated to the report.
“What has happened in Centcoma is unacceptable: when the senior management seems uncertain, our military suffers,” said a member of the House of Representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican of California.
The problems of leadership in Centcoma reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-sided report explains in detail the misstatements made in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of Obama ' s administration have been ordered to falsify reports, it claims that analysts felt that Centcoma ' s leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events”, the report reported.
For example, the officer of Centcoma publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is probably known," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence officer of the United States Central Command subverted the command documents to reduce the threat from IGII in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that analysts were concerned that the Islamic State was being investigated had been falsified.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more disaggregated data.
An additional, not yet completed investigation by Centkoma is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Committee on the Exploration of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the findings of the Republican operational group.
“It was between 2014 and 2015 that Centka created an excessively closed process for intelligence assessments on IGIL and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Shiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party of the Committee, in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives.
According to Shiff, this procedure “stopped the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral status of analysts and “depleted divergent views”.
But Shiff and the Democrats argue that there was no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom's analysts to bring their conclusions under "task or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, opened after the complaints of Centcoma analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation of the Chief Inspector continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes find themselves in the context of integrated data processing, and the Special Service and Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the scope of the question of whether the goal of the American bombing in Iraq and Syria is being achieved (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence are now claiming).
But last year's statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the Islamic State repeats the disputes that occurred more than ten years ago when an intelligence analyst by Centcom Gregor Hucker wrote a research article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration, due to the protests of many analysts, had supported a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protests that had been investigated by the Islamic State.
According to officials last year, the Huker team concluded that, despite public return claims, the aircraft owners of the Islamic State-owned oil pipelines did not significantly deteriorate the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil pipelines to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not spread outside the Central Command, as reported in the September Times newspaper.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony of the Senate, which many MPs considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
4 times in the female grass hockey season, thus approaching the crucial understanding with Britain
Killing once three goals in the match, which ended the victory over Japan with an account of 6-1, Katy Bem opened the account on Thursday by the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on the grass when the Americans won a win over the Indian team with an account of 3-0.
Five heads in two games must be a memorable achievement, but Bem, who is 27 years old, says that she is not sure if she would ever do anything like that.
"The mind is not an app," she said.
I'm really not one of those people who follow their goals.
This is what she knows: the 4-0 U.S. account at the Olympics, and they compete for the first place in their team with Britain, which remains unbeatable after Japan's 2-0 game on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their team of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of Dutch opponents, the leaders of another group, in a short time when the quarterfinals will start.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made the noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London games.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time to take a grass hockey club when she was 3 (the oldest twins played this kind of sport in Drexel) and joined the National Assembly at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not take her turn to the finals.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammate did not fit in.
The following year, Coyg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change”, Bem said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have right now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bem opened an account in the first half of the game with uncomfortable hands on short distances.
India came to play without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprised and kept account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bem took the initiative.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then the spiral went into the middle and sent the ball straight to the door, thus giving the Americans the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first tournament for the U.S. doorman Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bem.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how well it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
Among the non-Olympian games - "day" of the bat
No matter where you are, no matter how long you're at, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be unchanging and inevitable, a combination of competition and desire.
It's an Olympic fire, and there's this hot spell that goes from the sink to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in a coffee order and not hear about Simon Bies, Katie Ledecki or about the hostility between Michael Fellps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Douli.
Douli, for the first time participating in the Olympics, a beautifying man with balls on his cheeks, could be among the celebrities shown in the premieres promoted by sponsors and lifelong advertising roles, whether he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fan.
But 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic matches on the battalion.
The Olympic fire does not shed light on all the same events.
Far from the center, partly in the shadows, there are those sports that are not widely recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, shooting from a bow, bashminton, tekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reigning.
But if I'm allowed to speak up for your personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest promise of the battalion.
Although the battalions have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they competed in the games in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are of the Olympics.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States had sent athletes to compete, they had never won medals at the battalion, and their athletes had not finished until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share male awards and the Chinese and Canadians are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the battalion has an outside charm, especially because for an uneducated ear they are more closely associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
They really have comedy potential — the caricature of endless slopes — but also the essence of gymnastics and water courses, two kinds of sports that they mainly combine.
The word "bout" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trampleline for taps in the water."
The applicants for victory are drawn on a giant battalion, almost 30 feet in air, and must complete the series of acrobatic tricks (turns, swings and salt) before the final landing.
They are evaluated for the performance, complexity and time of the flights, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most popular Olympic course is ahead.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes to the back and forward, over and over in the field.
They seek not only the final drawing or the starting wall, but also, as in the case of the television camera, the other moving edge: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the viewer pass through.
But I think she's getting a little tired of watching the game.
He's got his brooms on his broom.
The batutist's direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, looks like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And of course, they don't have to be without competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy end-of-the-life noise throughout the program, there's no loopholes in length, just a strange, obvious disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest to the day Olympic kind of sport.
Women ' s qualification competitions and then the finals will take place on Friday, broadcast at the hour of Eastern European time; men on Saturday, also at the hour.
NBC will broadcast the finals of the agenda starting at 14:00 a.m.
In the midst of the Olympic Games, a peaceful, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the general bass.
And if awareness can only be gained by driving and objectivizing sportsmen — as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by American gymnasts — Douli is only waiting for her new amazing crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a former ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of a breakup?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong Western ally with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country by increasing the number of its territories.
Only in the last week did thousands of people go out in the streets, requiring radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was cruel.
Observers claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites allegedly taken at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Representative for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will continue to be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — there is even a new suburban train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
Her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly referred to government repression - opposition in the territory of States were prevented by the fact that dissidents had actually been forced to shut up.
Many of them were sent to prison, killed or exiled in remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people keep pushing and leaving options other than protesting, the resurrection will rise,” said Seyum Teschome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the Government Coalition ' s occupation.
Following the widely criticised elections last year, the Government party and its allies have fully exacerbated the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea increase; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has brought hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadana National Liberation Front, may try to use riots and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why a few years of bitter feelings in the depths of the soul are now taking root.
First, it would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become popular and the internet service has improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians have said that this is how they were organized for protests.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in small areas.
But that's also changing.
"We will work together at the same start," said Mulata Gemeč, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of the Amharic and Oromo people feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tugrai ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, even until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly experienced the first signals of dissatisfaction and used investigators to obtain data and dissipate opponents.
"The current regime lacks a healthy sense," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Heilemariam Desalen, came from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Melesa, who was born in the region of Tigris in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam was a southern woman.
Analysts say it does not enjoy the trust of the Tigrai-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will result in even greater bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people had protested against the fact that analysts had apparently been the elections that the Government had called for and had then produced results.
During the subsequent repressions, many protestors were killed, although in less than the last few months, and this period of riots was relatively rapid.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the Ethiopian leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new interurban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this clearly did not stop the increase in domestic discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Honduras, the city of Amharic, attacked companies belonging to the Tigris, and anti-Tigerian hatred on social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that protestors make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The US Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose force in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this pressured cannon," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, a “sarcast”
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict that covered his pre-election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week said that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the candidate to serve as president of the Republican Party to address the American people with insight.
It also placed his successors, who tried to protect him during a period of trouble, in an awkward situation, because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking of this assumption on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded IGIL.
But in a post on Twitter early in the morning, on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just emancipating.
This post was a direct contradiction to the claim made just one day earlier when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Radio-Conservator-in-Chief Hewitt tried to help Trampo soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the presidency of the Republican Party did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal was when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy in the background of the downgrading of the rating.
Trump and Clinton made a competitive speech on the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this topic.
Again, he turned to Twitter, warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and said he was bored.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he made a general criticism of himself, almost expressing the idea that the Russian should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Finally, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trampu to go beyond what is acceptable in political terms and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding to his fans to see how they work and then "explain" them on either side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, who was conducting an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they're sloppy enough to treat them differently.
Instead of easing speeches to the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sensitive tone in the past few days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that the Trump is leaving Clinton with a major overhang in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going to Florida with it.
Although Trump is usually trying not to apologize for the provocations he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have made his faithful allies uncomfortable: they have to publicly support him, whatever his provocation.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who was one of the most famous Deputy Trump, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview with the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he is saying is an acceptable political comment," Juliani said when he was asked about the credibility of the approval of Trump that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true that before Obama IGIL was almost unknown to a small organization, he called it a non-hazardous threat, and that is why everything happened because he had taken the army out of Iraq.
The majority of the mid-statistical republics are convinced that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as the Secretary of State, has enabled IGII to develop because it has not been able to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for every word he said and foresight.
He was laughing at the "poor unfortunate" television experts who were trying to figure it out, and he said, "They're weak!"
Some democrats ridiculed the justifications of Trump as a further confirmation that he did not fit in with the presidents.
When the squeezed coffee comes back to Greenpoint
The "Verb" cafe was a shard that only took place in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but had served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a glass on the Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, is selling soap in the form of cookies.
Locals complained about her as the last loss in the renovated city.
Molly Krabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a charity store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The Verb coffee shop was opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
There are Wi-Fi and credit cards in the new Verb, but there are some of the same staff and the same atmosphere.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new "Verba" is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffee maker who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and was there by the end of the day.
When one of the clients offered to propose him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36 years old, left many behind.
"Verb" works with the same beagle distributor and bought the same model of coffee maker.
It's even got mirrors from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He proposed new rites.
The menu contains sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and has a caper topping or a hot arch.
There's a watch from the stormy rice.
They don't deliver beer in coffee anymore, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later, Rodríguez said he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old permanent customers.
"Many of the former customers have also issued Williamsberg prices," he said.
In one recent resurrection, Rebecca Oliveira was one of such customers.
Olivera, aged 34, had lived in Williamsberg before and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that imposed me on Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, though that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another newspaper.
Tom Rosental, another former client, has faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, like hours, I came, and they prepared for me my run with oil and all manner of things," he said.
Rodriguez indicated that he wanted to experiment and introduce new monitors into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making a regular order, but sometimes he changes something with the help of a bacon, egg or cheese on the run in all ways.
Rodríguez said he was not offended that the charity had once taken hold of the old place.
In addition, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to prepare special soap for Verba, using coffee from coffee prepared in a cold way as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to find a place in the window for his new neighbors to feel desired.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point for the sale of juices plans to pour on bottles and sell cold-formed coffee.
There is a likelihood that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite views.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client, and he shared that he was killed in the pit when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whitt said that by coming in and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plumbing Table"
In March 1933, shortly after the rise of the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt went to lunch at the Oval Office.
As a guruman, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable sights of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua-gra and the Maryland Towing Soup.
His menu that day was more modest: fried eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée, and dessert pudding from black.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Zigelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Cou, added, "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The wives living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
The last book of the Koua, Ragu Po-Chinese, was devoted to the Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a joint apartment in Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on the Street Fruit Garden".
Their new joint work on the Table, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
To some extent, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a brief breakfast room in the Fleiron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, in the Birge region.
Zigelman, 54, ordered slender cheese and butterboard with olive pieces, and Kou, 57, took an Indian, potato purée, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for the discussion of food in the period of depression.
"The roulettes used a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was an peanut roll, a liver roll, a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you needed for dinner.
Kou's smelt.
"I guess he was lying in the stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women ' s groups prepared for farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who fed hungry Europeans during World War I. The Flying Table describes how the country coped with the sudden end of being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, awkward topic for Americans," said Kou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget approach was not easy: mystery candles, such as rolls and pancakes, became the main food products; the pancake was "a beautiful way to use the blends," Zigelman noted, "because the ovens could hide unfavourable ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, the former basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed light.
People have experimented with strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
Doing research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a copy of that era: a sealed bow made of peanut butter.
"This supplement to the dining table was not successful," Kou said.
Zigelman added, "That was very strange."
The peanut oil does not fit completely into the coal.
This was typical of many household recipes.
As never before and ever since, household experts — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to accept challenges, and to turn the burd into an out-of-the-art spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"Silver Table" is the essence of curious historical facts.
The Government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Guver's position in the spirit of "let the pies eat", is particularly puzzling.
A public transport of the simple farmland of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a refined millionaire.
"He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with soup," said Cou.
He almost ate in a golden table, wearing a tuxedo.
It was fantastically depleted from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to give an example to his own stomach.
As explained in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that was totally unsatisfied, and this resulted in the White House “not only using the most depleted food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared.”
Many of the culinary receipts of the Depression era have been forgotten once the country has risen up again.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science has been used in food preparation.
The wives relate that during the book writing, they better understand the eating habits of the mother of Zigelman — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was really afraid of a careless attitude towards food," said Kou.
Zigelman remembers, "She poisoned people in full series."
There was one bad case with the propellers.
When the Tarellas in Eisenberg's deserts, they and Kou got a dessert that they prepared at home: a dessert from black, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a black mouse," said Zigelman, adding that it was widely accepted - giving modest recipes bozos names.
There was no blubbering, blackness, a little pain, sugar, water, and cover.
All were reluctant to put the bed in a tight, brown, sticky fabric.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Kou asked for extras twice.
He said to the woman, with the vote of the trusted budget maker, "A few rubble Greek nuts would not be in trouble here."
The arrest of representatives of the mass dragon case in the Havana Cave is extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Press Court had left the media dragon case under arrest in the Havana Basin on 14 November, satisfying the request for an investigation.
In the case of the accused, there are 14 persons.
Recall that on 14 May, there was a massive dragon in the Havana Basin, a number of hundreds of people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, using weapons that killed three people.
Former head of the warehouse, Yuri Chabueva and a lawyer, the co-founder of the Public Health Nation organization, Alexander Bocharnik, was charged with murder.
The question of the second year of 2016 pension indexing can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, the Vice-President of the Government of RF, Olga Goladec, announced this during a visit to the Brian region.
We have specific options to raise the pension to alleviate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now underway in the middle of the year, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks," says the Interfax Hunger.
Commenting on the proposed plan by the head of the Centre for Strategic Development by Alexei Kurdrin to increase the pension age for half a year, the Deputy Prime Minister reported that the topic was not addressed in the cabin.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on the position on the full index of pension payments in 2017.
Rocky and Grigoryan went to the finals of the low-caliber firefighting.
The Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigoriyan were at the end of a small-calibre win competition from the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamenski took 629 balls and took the first place, a new Olympic record in the qualification.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 bets.
There were eight best athletes in the final.
Stone is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethullah Gulen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of a coup d'état in Turkey.
"I demand that the independent international commission conduct an investigation into a coup d'état," says the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gulen strongly denied participation in the Gosperévoirate, stressing that his organization had never claimed political authority.
The Istanbul Court had previously seen the arrest of the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempt to turn the war took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies pay for legal services during a patent dispute with Merck
The company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the issue of a Hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc manufacturer, a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was released from payment of $200 million for violations of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the U.S. judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other non-ethical practices.
When referring to a trial on Thursday, a judge of the U.S. Federal District Court, Beth Lebson Freeman, said that Gilead had the right to reimbursement of the costs incurred in the course of the complaint.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck were brought to trial each other, claiming their rights to a laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
Armed forces with U.S. support claim to have taken full control of the Islamic State of Manbije
Armed forces established with U.S. support have taken full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last of the Islamic state fighters left, the group representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of soldiers who were hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were held captive by soldiers, reported to the Reuters agency Sharfan Darvis from the Manbija military council's SDS.
"The city is completely under our control now, but we're running clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the candidate for the presidents of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly in the Clinton Fund, the former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees and the former Secretary of State declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015 they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a financial transparency standard,” said Clinton Jennifer Palmieri, a pre-election adviser.
Unlike them, Donald Trump is hiding for fraudulent reasons and violates his previous pledges to publish his tax statements.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to make their tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote Clinton Jan Sams, a member of the pre-election headquarters on Twitter, referring to a democratic party candidate's statement.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to issue them until the checks were completed.
The criticisms of Trump, including the candidate for the presidents of the Republican Party in 2012 by Mitt Romni and other republican brothers, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, welfare contributions, business operations and other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up with the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on publishing publishers who had convinced Trump to report their tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the economics talks in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate has done without exception to the presidents for decades: to make his tax declarations public," she said to those who had gathered.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any taxes or almost no taxes in the 1990s, and the New York Times business viewer had quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who believed that cases might still exist.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule called the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska State, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS inspection, and that Trump was afraid not of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax returns until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had been paid as a source of income.
Their main investment was a low-cost index peacock fund, and Clinton reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Preservatives with chili powder and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The protection of the environment in Tanzania uses a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from embarking on human settlements, placing in them a condom filled with dust of chili.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee on Nature Protection, took on its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a four-step non-violent way of protecting their homes and crops without causing animal harm.
Many have used a copy to protect themselves.
On Friday will be the World Day of Elephants, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we have invented a set of instruments ..., we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will not let the elephants on their fields without causing harm to the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell, Executive Director.
The first two steps are to burn the flare in front of the border of the elephant and to give signals through the horns.
If he couldn't get rid of it, they'd throw away the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with the boy in the condoms, and its end is spinning, only the phytyl is left outside.
When the condoms are burned, they are melted with a small dust of chili powder in the air.
One world is usually enough to turn the elephant towards the other.
The ultimate measure is the launch device that shoots Roman lights into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after the attempt of the Gosperevert in July of this year.
Such data was brought to the attention of the head of the media in Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, and local journalists.
At the first stage, we called 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish Foreign Office.
Remember, in July, a coup d'état occurred in Turkey.
The authorities have officially declared that the hospice has failed and reported the detention of more than six thousand people, including the war crimes of the highest and middle class.
As a result, 290 people were killed by the attempted coup d ' état, reported by the Turkish media.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israel's telephone code at the request of the Arabs -- reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin had launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israel telephone code, and the officials referred to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lancman, author of a documentary on the Shoa Holocaust, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the Lancman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel ' s telephone code list.
The country, however, had not been mentioned among States where direct calls could be made from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
Written by Lanceman.
In exchange for Kempinski Bristol, it provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In an explanation request, the director raised the issue at the hotel ' s headquarters.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, was "shocking him."
Clark Hotel said that this measure was "an intelligent solution to the management of the Kempinski father network."
The reason behind the move was even more angered by the director.
"Most of our Arab guests, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed," said Lanzman, a hotel servant, according to him.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a terrible disgrace”, reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible disgrace.
What happened in Germany, that is, in this network of fathers, is even more humiliating.
There's no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the officer.
There was little resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel was simply “concerned” with the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"They would be ashamed," another post stated that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried off any charges, calling what happened "inspection" and "excusement" before Lanceman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-set list," says the representative of the Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and tear gas bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest against government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and resin bullets against protesters.
Disorders began when police officers tried to fire students, which resulted in police using tear-off bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some participants in the protest could be seen writing on graffiti walls against the provisional duty of President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesting media came out to support President Dilmu Rusef, who had voted in favour of her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71 per cent, reports RT Business Portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the traffic between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the Ambassador of Russia to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian companies in conducting business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing relations with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, freight traffic between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission to Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas, mainly to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top-20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can say with confidence that last year's record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the city of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezz, where memories of the ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition," he said.
The State continues to spin holes in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the mandates of the director-general of Almaz-Antey, the “loss of work” and the “loss of trust”.
For the next three years, Gennadi Bendersky has been appointed as NGO leader.
The information on Neskorodov's dismissal was only released on Thursday evening and did not raise a broad media resonance.
What would explain such a silence in the context of a massive rearming of the army?
It is likely that the management of the RF does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This also confirms that the defence and industrial complex (OPC) has many problems, and the State does not want to draw attention to them by society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of order in the sector.
The Almaz NGO is the group ' s main enterprise specializing in the production of marine and ground-based rocket complexes.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the POLIMENT-REDUT and Morpheus CFCs, which are planning to install new corvets, fretas, esmints and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Portal Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by a break in the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" must be the main system of WFPs on the new WMF ships.
According to the information I receive, no actual successful test has been carried out in several years.
True, as far as I can tell, there's no clear fault of Almaza, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that a delay in the entry into service may also occur with the P-500.
Work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes must enter the military.
In Minobanda, they are assured that “work is planned and will all be completed within the time frame set”, although in 2014 the Office acknowledged the problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been leading Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that project delays could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and much money is known to love silence.
The Director of the Defence Companies usually resigns from positions of his or her own free will, under the agreement agreement of the parties, or is transferred to another work.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the leader of Almaza was perhaps a stupendous figure and was opposed to the lower top of the "disorders".
It seems that the State is no longer willing to accept such conduct.
Through shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute with the Minioband facilities and do not carry out the tasks assigned to them.
At the same time, the management of the RF seeks to punish the officers who have been tested (starcraft).
The focus is on the problems of the sector and the President himself.
Vladimir Putin chaired the Military Industrial Commission and held meetings on disarmament periodically.
The Kremlin protects a number of OPC managers in an effort to have a loyal directorship that will be performed at the top of the order.
This is a far from ideal policy, but there are no State instruments at the root of corruption and the lack of normal competition in OPC.
The situation in defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of OPC managers, the RF leadership is taking successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The staffing of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergey Shawgu as Minister of Defence.
It seems to me that the President has taken on arms a well-known saying, “You want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the Soviet military forces and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow ' s sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, she worked very effectively.
This proved the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
In the cold war, the “victims” were eventually strengthened by international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there was no calm angle left.
Despite the general disaster, the West has refused to speak with Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies in our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and to move beyond the new borders of world policy.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner fights on the finish line, resulting in British cycling gold.
Scotland's Kallum Skinner competed for a triumph in a man's sprint on a veldrom in Rio last night, which resulted in the British team trio protecting its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was the strongest that his Scottish friend, Sir Chris Hoi, had made his own, and the young man was proud to go into history, sneaking straight to win the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi declared the right to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing the modest sixth in the March World Championship on Trek Bikes in London, despite Hoi's career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a member of Jamie Staff.
They did it just once when Hindus appeared.
Hoya's care has also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Krempton have tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindus, Kenny, the Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner had established an Olympic record in qualification, but the norm was passed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindus drove on a larger transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and took the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindus when they entered the Pedestal.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is an easy comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We've established an Olympic record at the final and won the World Cup.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After the 2012 London triumph, together with Kenny and Hoi, Hindus admitted that he deliberately fell on track after a failed start.
He later declined the comment, and there was no way of bringing an appeal from the UK competitors.
There was no such issue this time in the greatest victory.
Hindus said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the throne."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of the 10 called races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of the progress made in the past five months, then there will be another five days of success.
In the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the ability to imagine, as he repeats Hoy's performance, winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would show how Kenny, who was 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23rd (i.e., the sacred date in the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgray, Mo Faraha and Roger Bannister) brings his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny is in a sprint, which starts today and is playing for three days.
A 28-year-old leaving Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this right now.
Team races are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's kind of easy to win one another if you're honest.
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get a knighthood."
It was the only day you played the medal, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clansey, Steven Berk and Owen Doll are qualified by the fastest four-mile chase.
They ended up at 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be at the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before the training session, when officials demanded him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katy Archibald from Millingua improved the world record, showing time 4:13.360.
The British Command has come to the conclusion that it is up to a possible bike team to take over the Olympics and earn a lot of medals.
After indeed exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas on the other hand, not the last one, the withdrawal from the post of technical director Shane Satton in April because of charges of sexism and anxiety, and the care of large figures, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race for the first evening on the wheel, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now seems to be reaching the peaks at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future Portland Metallurgical Factory in Threatened by the break-up of the electricity contract
The future Portland aluminium plant in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is under threat because the power company, which supplies the plant, according to one of the plant ' s owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be dissolved.
This step is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be under threat at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
The entire 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be found in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the power station in England last year.
The Portland Metallurgical Plant Alcoa loses money and risks closure.
These actions have led to the reflection of the future of the factory for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the factory.
The company AGL, which provides a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power station in Latrob Walli, reported that it expects that the other three owners will also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling part of the plant belongs to the Alcoa and Alumina joint short-term company, while the CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp belong to smaller parts.
“The company AGL expects the portland facility to continue to work, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts referred to are so-called 'hectic contracts', which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month break-up period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL still expects these contracts to bring its share of income in 2017," the electricity company said.
However, any potential impact on AGL’s profits from the financial year 2018 to date is limited to projections of the strong future market for optimising electricity prices.
The company AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in the form of “representation”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but that it still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses some 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the real show star Cardassian, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, a 20-year-old model and the fourth daughter of the Clan Cardassian-Jenner Chris, appeared on the led September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is a member of the Estee Lauder brand, described this news on fashion weekends in Milan, Paris and New York, in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the siege was accompanied by strange (or simply by the "Cardashian Family"?), which produced the reality video, in which the entire Cardashian-Jenner family (the Debosher Rob and Caitlin, also joined the most popular uncle of the show business, the producer of the "Cardashian Family" Ryan Sicrist), forgot about the presence of the sister on the siege, and finally, the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is a standard summary line of almost all children's television shows dedicated to birthdays. (The secret is saying, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the multifaceted rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris had to get that glory anyway to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have no doubt entered the new era of the Cardassian show.
Let Candall Kim's older sister get on Vogue's bet earlier (she showed up with her husband Kanya West in April 2014), but the magazine's September bet is an achievement.
September is the most sold year-on-year issue of Vogue.
The thickness of a gift-like edition is higher than that of a modern magazine. The issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionist Portal, 615 pages of the previous 832 pages of the page were advertising).
News of the star falling on its cover is expected with such impatience that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine have been merged into an official advertisement.
Among the previous women who had fallen into the siege were Naomi Campbell, Linda the Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “marks that work in models” than “models that are celebrities”.
The Laureate of the Oscar Prize and the face of the Dior Jennifer Lawrence brand were presented on the bet in 2013, one year after the honour of Lady Gage.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as his generation's "excellent model" falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful careers in the Lemonade album.
Of course, not all are happy with Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, given her past TV reality show, always had to be a tent.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Giji Hadid, calling them "sucks of the moment."
These moods were once again shattered after the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to be angry.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, yes, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their same applications that are available on payroll.
She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crowford's daughter, Love magazine.
And in leisure time, maybe still seeing her sister Courtney and her children, she's taking part in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to provide 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the least protected population are refused services at public legal centres each year, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further cut funding to and from the scope of its activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mainly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair property deprivation and so on — have already been denied legal assistance and representation free of charge.
Public legal services already operating outside of the scope are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Public Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that, according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have already been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government ' s decision was not annulled, the situation would only deteriorate.
"Queenland's public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the necessary vital services," he said.
People from violent relationships, people from unrestrained and incapacitated debt, families from divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will fund 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to cancel these funding cuts immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State fulfilled its commitment to raise the financing of free legal aid to the country ' s average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and to the Government of Palashtuk to be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was prosecuted after the officer allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to trial: it is alleged that the headquarters did not take any action after reporting that his Operational Director in North Carolina had threatened a gun to the staff member when he was driving to the jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court case brought on Wednesday in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former programmer at the state's pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited a few months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized that "this won't happen."
Director Earl Phillip "gets out the gun, puts his right index finger on the cock and sends a dowel on Vincent's knee," says Bordini in a complaint.
On appeal to the local and regional pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillipo were being treated.
"You don't have to shoot guns to hurt," Bordini said in a complaint.
The claim took place only two days after the Presidents of the Republic Party produced the fora, told the North Carolina audience that "the people of the Second Amendment" — understood as the owners of weapons and his lovers — could begin to act if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trump's pre-election headquarters said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not spoken in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the pre-election headquarters for non-serious control and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, abuse and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slowing down in response to a request for a comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip wasn't a success.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the pre-election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one responded quickly.
The candidate for the presidents of the Republican party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District Court (Charlott).
Britain must send the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand Hitrow
Hitrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in London as a whole but throughout the country.
It was, in my view, the huge advantage of Hitrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to bring our peoples and regions to the benefit of the Game.
The Olympics have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again, creating opportunities for locals and companies next to Hitrow.
We will only create 10,000 new interns, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Hitrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Hitrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrow answers any question he has.
Like the Hitrow Olympics, this is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Hitrou, which has implemented the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 selected by the best five-year airport terminal, to T2 built in the middle of two of the world's most busy landing fields.
They are now ready to provide a third landing zone, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for Britain, and I am sure that the expansion of Hitrow will also be.
The time has come for us to send the Olympic spirit into the necessary movement and to expand the Hitrow, to secure our commercial future, and to create a legacy of the skills and jobs that Britain will be able to boast about.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hitrou and former Trade Attash of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "mice" about blocking the ad
For companies that earn money on the Internet, attempting to bypass the software to block the advertising is a game in the "mice" according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the blockers on its desktop version, AdBlock Plus published a blog entry that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the loop around its advertising to make it more difficult for advertisers to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now says he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “such a kind of mutual struggle between the open source blockers community and those who are trying to bypass it is continuing since the time of the blocking of the ad”, and that Facebook might present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network had entered into battle is a clear indication of how big a problem the advertising blockers had become for the industry.
Around 200 million people around the world are using advertising blockers, according to last year's study Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those using such software in 2013.
Given 1.3 billion active daily users entering Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's revenue from advertising.
However, the company is following the blockers on the table, as mobile blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, on-board advertising is a sufficient income item to make Facebook think of such a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its advertising preferences tool to provide people with more control over how advertising was targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said that new Adblock filters were of concern, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a cruel tool, so instead we focus on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to deliver management to people.
A woman was transferred to a Swiss highway in an apparent suicide episode
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling for witnesses after a number of vehicles were taken by the woman on the highway early in the morning at Thursday in a clear attempt to kill herself.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morge in the canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the darkness of despair and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, hit several vehicles, including the truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police, who have called them and someone else who witnessed the incident, have responded.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in such a situation, was initiated, counsel Jile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve said.
However, it remains to be ascertained whether any of the drivers involved would be charged.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both involving a person in the dark on the road — it was condemned that drivers could not expect a random meeting on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing a death in custody after she hit and killed an A1 man next to Pyern on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a police woman, who had responded to an extreme challenge, had managed the vehicle in a way that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “perfectly exceptional and unpredictable”, the judge said.
Someone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus, perhaps once inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Learned from the Nasov Institute of Space Studies, Goddard has developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have a hot waterless surface and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, ever having conditions similar to that of the earth.
The scholars had previously assumed that the small speed of Venus' return was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus might have had a dispersal atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and still slowly returning.
The model also looked at the early Venus topography.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and sufficient geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"According to the GISS model, Venus' slow return is based on its daily sun side almost twice a month," explained a press release from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a dense layer of clouds that acts as a sun that protects the surface of the planet from the substantial heat of the sun.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, in any case, are somewhat colder than in our days on earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously envisaged by the planet study experts.
Although Venus once may have been inhabited, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans have disappeared and its water vapour has been burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew away, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained — Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers have shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche team coach post.
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice-President/Chief Commander of the Colorado Team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years I have been my chief coach and vice president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long time thinking deeply about how I could improve this team to give it the needed depth and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and the Vice-President of the hockey activities must be ideally matched by the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patric told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach in his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought 112 points and victory to the Central Division, but Colorado was torn apart by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points remained from the Wild team in the fight for the second easy trip to the Western Conference.
A doorman from Slava Hall, Roy won four Cup Stanleys — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and halt the strike
Working attacks on oil wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussion are beginning a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties reported.
Attacks against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadicly organized on the North Sea platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United Nations and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current disputes," says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week to take a fresh look at the problems.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first over 25 years, was directed against potential wage reductions of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contractors working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The decrease in rates by the company was followed by a 10 per cent reduction in rates for contract staff working on the beach in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give it the space necessary to overcome market decline.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-mixing with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the low prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by Britain.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that occurred in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of return of the stars to the Pleiade
Kepler's last space telescope mission helped astronomers to collect the most complete directory of star speeds in the Pleiades.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster are turning at different speeds and how the periods of rotation are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luis Ribal, a scientist at the Center for Infrared Treatment and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiade is in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the collection are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They come back as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speed, these adult stars emit large amounts of star wind.
While traveling through the magnetic fields of the star, these winds act as a brake to the star.
As the star grows older, its speed of return begins to slow down.
The Kepler measures the speed of each star’s return, tracking the time between the appearance of the known star pens — such as the sun pens.
The new directory of speeds suggests that more massive stars are becoming slower than less massive ones.
Fishing compares stars to dancers: the larger the pirates make slower than the smaller.
"In the "Pley" we observe that those who return slowly are usually more massive, while those who return faster are usually very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the Pleiade is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star properties with speeds of return.
"The Pleiade's constellation provides a starting point for the theoretical models of return of stars, both young and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why stars slow down the speed of their return and hang their dancing shoes on the iron.
Fishl and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiade's speed of return in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of the group of Ukrainian divorcing detainees in Crimea is conducted by two agencies, Commercial.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, confessions were given by the Ukrainian city of Energodar Evgenien Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the result.
According to him, as objects for diversion, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchen steam transfer, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airports.
The law enforcement authorities believe that the detention has not been far from complete by all dividends.
This has, in particular, been the basis for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev judgment of Simferopol, notes the publication.
The main coach of the Russian football assembly was Stanislav Churches.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Churchesov as the leading Russian football coach.
The contract will be expected for two years before the end of CM-2018.
On 11 August, he appointed Stanislav Churchesov as the leading Russian football coach.
He was a well-known footballer who had previously played in the Moscow Spartake position, as well as a coach with solid experience who was a teacher of Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, Zemchužina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinam, and the Warsaw Legion, who became the winner of the national championship and the country's cube.
It is reported that the contract with Churches will be signed as soon as possible and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romaštenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov will enter his training station.
There is information that the salary of the entire training staff will be €2.6 billion a year.
According to the media, the management of the FSF has set before Stanislav Church to bring Russia to the semifinal and to conquer the medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered establishing a competitive environment in the team as a priority and was going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchess, he's glad the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Church Russia will be held in Antalya on 31 August, which will be a social meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, Leonid Slucky, a leading Russian football football coach, took him to the CSKA club.
He said that he had resigned from his post after the Russian national team had failed to speak in Euro-2016 in France.
However, he took responsibility for the bad result of the collection.
Grieving between Angola and the UAR, Namibia suffered severely during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved enormous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive themselves as understanding free primary and secondary education, many poor countries require education in secondary and even primary schools.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training for “cost reimbursement”.
However, primary school education in Namibia is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past ten years.
Against the international trend of rising inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared with the 1993 Gini ratio, which is the standard income inequality rate, 15 points have fallen.
Then, 23 years ago, this rate was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined, from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom rating in Africa, according to the Reporters Without Borders.
The country has overpowered the United States and other rich States considerably.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Transparency International Human Rights Index.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt ratio to GDP is around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional methods of assessment, remains high enough, almost 28 per cent.
Like other countries in the region, the high HIV/AIDS rate in Namibia is nearly 17 per cent of the population.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with higher average income, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the challenges facing the weak economies of the world.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the deserts of the country, isolated breeds of hunter-gatherers, which must somehow be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy four centuries ago is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not intend to give up, and the country was addressing its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities have been engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
Significantly, the competing political factions gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of medical visitors to the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians understood that the neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate, to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly argued that rich natural resources can easily be cursed by contributing to the wealth of a few from many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s income from natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum proceeds from the sale of resources of the country, and to review investment laws and procurement contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As Hage Gingob, head of State, the media often say what it does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms received, the President said.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that are beginning to have serious shortcomings - racism, colonial construction, inequality and low levels of development - can get on the way to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many heard of the Golden Varna - the oldest gold objects created by man (4,600 - 4,200 B.C.E.).
This was the largest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found in the excavations of the Varnen Necropolis, more than three thousand pounds [6 kg].
Only one burial, known as "Mogila No. 43", was extracted from 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold of the world can soon pass to the invisible bush discovered by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a dohistorical settlement known as the Telle Young.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Telle Yunacs are located far from the sea, next to the village of the Yunacs of Pazardijk district.
The bush is a golden striped ring.
Yavor Byjiev, the digger at Telle Yunac, dated 4600 years before our era and said that she was the oldest of Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are dated about the same period, from 4600 to 4200 B.C.E.
There are currently no technologies to accurately date metals.
How, then, can you be sure that gold is older than gold?
Professor Byjiev obviously knows more than Reuters reported: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of the Young People is greater than the gold of Varna."
It's a very important thing: it's kind of a tiny thing, but it's big enough to take a place like that in history.
In an interview with Reuters Byojiev, scientists soon analyzed the composition of the metal and re-examined the archaeological layer where a gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell the Young People is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
At present, Telle Yunaca is considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th century B.C.E.
During the following centuries, metal processing in the region has developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a fully-fledged industry.
National historiography for this archaeological community has a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th century B.C.E., a population of the city type began to appear around metal treatment centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of them, the Telle Youngacs may be the oldest, since they found artifacts here 4900 years before our era.
I'd call Telle Yunaca a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand-year-old Shumer," said Bojjiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the common understanding of that word.
The Tela Yunaca excavations have been taking place since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists dug up nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found that once reached three meters high.
There was little left from houses and masters, but archaeologists clearly distinguished the streets, public buildings, urban flats, business center and residential areas.
Telle Yunacs are often referred to as the Bird City: there were dozens of clay figures of birds found here.
All birds are in a state of peace, and from here on they are assumed not to be decorative objects but to be objects of local worship.
The "Bird City" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era - possibly indo-European tribes from the north-east.
There were no cities in the carriages, so there were horses and weapons.
The three-metre building walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal war: remains of the elderly, women and children with wounds caused by the armed forces were found inside the houses.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
The search for this civilization has been a powerful stimulus to the “golden Varna”, found relatively recently in 1972.
It is logical that Varna's gold was supposed to be something to be ahead of - something like the tiny gold bush set up in Tella Yunaca.
In Porsche, model 911 Targa was artificially aged
Officially it is stated that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is hand-held by unit specialists working with serial machines.
For example, the retro-luck is in the special color of the body of Etna Blue, which was designed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - in this color even the logo of the model is beautiful.
In addition, the target received a firm white graph along the board and a special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drive, as well as some body-forming details decorated with “white-golden metal”.
Inside the retro-reflector is less noticeable: it is largely distinguished by sero-blue gamma-forming, new seats with expanded ranges of electrical controls and separate black anodized steel with unit logo thresholds.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car voucher and a well separated album with photographs of the production process.
The strong installation of Porsche Exclusive specialists has not been affected: the retro-targ by characteristics is completely compatible with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbo-propeller of 3.0 litres, developing 420 C.E. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued with limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each individual athlete will be reported.
Facebook and the blockers of the commercials have released a “arms race”
The recent implementation of Facebook technology to prevent the hiding of ads on social media sites has led decision makers to block the advertising of responses.
At AdBlock Plus they released a "opposite", but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The representatives of the Socset noted that, in order to deceive the new technology of unblocked advertising, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial announcements, also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they expressed regret at this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source from TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready in the next few hours.
Thus, the clashes and blockers have released their kind of “arms race”, trying to win each other, which has been damaged by users who have missed interesting records from friends or have seen advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently caused heated disputes.
In Murmanska, the violent man will stand before the court; Evening Murmansk.
His case had already been investigated by the Russian Federation ' s Committee of Inquiry on the Murmanian Region.
The accused 54-year-old man is very serious about committing violent acts of sexual nature.
As a result, at the end of November 2015, the defendant in the area of the Street of Pavlov in Murmansk committed sexual acts using violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The penalty provided for in that article provides for a maximum penalty in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring Crosseven Fengguang 370 to Russia and pickup Rich New - Site behind www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popular car class in China, which combines the dignity of the minivan and the cruiser.
Another alleged Russian prime minister is Pickap Rich New.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Auto salon this year have decided to ignore, so the empty exhibition halls of Krakus Expo will fill the Chinese companies.
In particular, the powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has many species on the Russian market, and which intends to offer some interesting news to our car lovers in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossroads, which sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (less than 550 thousand yuan in the current course).
The Russians are hardly aware of the fact that the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, Fengguang 370, as a result of the June sale, was able to reach the 11th place in the list of the most sold minivans, although due to high road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic burden on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Crosssven is built on the leading platform of the smallest model Fengguang 360, with 370 the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the bodies hear longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), more solid design and equipment.
The living room is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen “as in Tesla” on the central console was only on early cross-svene exhibits, and the machines were sold with “music” more easily.
Five of the seven seating positions are easily assembled, forming an even loading area of 1650 mm long, a maximum of 1500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine consists of only one - 1.5 litre gas "atmospheric" of 115 C.E., combined with a 5-degree mechanical transmission.
The dynamic quality of the machine is moderately reduced by the manufacturer, so the saving budget of the owner is at 6.7 l/100 km.
Pickap Rich New is well-known to Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the requested generation, but with the help of sophisticated Chinese designers.
Despite an ageing structure, this model has so far been used as a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unfavourable ‘worker’.
At the same price, Rich New is probably interested in Russians because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for selection: a petrol of 2.4 l (137 l) or a turbodiesel of 2.5 l (116 l).
The transmission box - only the mechanics, the lead - is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a strongly connected "front".
A new A9 flagship seat will be on the Dongfeng stand and its Russian Prime Minister's representation of the Chinese company announced in June.
Similar crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, one of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian liner Dongfeng is currently composed of two models: S30 and H30 Cross.
In seven months this year, the Chinese company’s dealers made 696 cars in our country.
Transport Tax Notices will cease to be sent by e-mail - www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending property tax notices.
All Russian autoowners are accustomed to the unaltered schedule: in summer and autumn they receive an invoice for the transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many will not be expecting them.
It was that the fiscal inspection without excessive noise had changed the procedure for notification of citizens.
To those registered in the "Personal Tax Office" on the official website of the nalog.ru department, the notices will be sent in electronic form.
In inspections, such Russians were automatically identified as online users and were removed from the standard "paper" transmission.
New developments are affecting all owners of vehicles and properties.
All others will continue to receive regular letters.
However, there is also an opportunity to return to the old scheme for account holders on the website.
To that end, they will have to visit the Tax Office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the preparation, when the letter will go for a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of internet service users of the tax inspection has exceeded 18 million, making it possible for the department to save a significant amount of money on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could register in the "personal office" for a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not be expected to receive e-mail notices and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the “Personal Tax Office” is made in three ways: through the entry of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by means of an electronic signature or login and password entered in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person in any tax inspection office (depending on the location of the settlement).
We recall that the transport tax has to be paid by 1 December this year.
The transmission of notifications began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve very high impact, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not disturb G-Power's masters, who took the lead in modifying the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sport version.
G-Power is known for its attachment to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying couval with tank aerodynamics and a drive up to a hundred by 5.4 cm?
The "muscules" of the mixed "helical" enjoyed the advantages of a 5.5 litre superimposed eight-litre.
And here's the dynamics of driving up to a hundred have improved to an indistinct 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirk" is capable of dragging up to 5.3 s.
However, the acceleration from the average speeds is likely to be much better.
The speed range is alarming: if the standard G 63 is not faster than 210 km/h, the Tuning Alley with a disabled electronic "shaft" is capable of exceeding 250 km/h.
Vehicles are practically different from their factory head, except for other wheels - 23 inches Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury unit announced a stunning 6 m-long conceptual cup that will be presented at the Pebbl Bich Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with BMW i "green subbrand" and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four ecological news reports are expected.
