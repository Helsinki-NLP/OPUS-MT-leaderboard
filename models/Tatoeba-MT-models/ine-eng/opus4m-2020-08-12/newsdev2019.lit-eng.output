Lina Firebendingi will honor Bedford Messer
In the photo: Lina Firesciensi is selling ice cream during the warm year, and in the winter it is spring.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been trafficked in the city centre will be honored with a private reception.
Lina Firefighters, selling ice creams and sprays at the Dinky Donuts on Bedford Midland Road, along with the family, were invited to a soup tea.
Nearly 3,000 people signed the petition online in order to be awarded or received recognition.
Mr. Fireman said she was honored to have such honors.
According to Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson, p. Firefighters with children and ants were invited to his office to look at the city's regional and historical artifacts and drink the soup tea.
"Lina Bedforde takes a special place, and its kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I am glad that she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
In her words, Mr. Firesanti thanked the "feelful" inhabitants of Bedford who thought of her and said, "This is a great honor and a beautiful conduct."
The petitioner Sarkab Mahmood claimed that he did not expect so many signatures.
After hearing about the reception that is planned to be held by the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy about Lena because she earned it because of her excellent character. ”
Street with Alsterio "Lambretta" club
The Lambretta motorists were not replaced by the 7th-century fashion culture satellites.
The group of Italian motorists is trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the creation of the first Alstere Lambretta club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered this weekend in Fermana district.
One of the first two members of the club Chris Wilson acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“I was only a motorist, but I learned that I could use it in a different way.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get into fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old to do that," he said.
"He was quite cheap and fairly reliable, you could have bought it at an affordable price, and if you had got to do something more than just go from point A to point B."
He participated in the TT Church of the island of Meno.
The first Alsterio Lambretta club was established at the beginning of the 8th decade and was reformed 12 years ago.
"About 1971 motorists and other modes of transport were becoming less and less concerned, and the clubs were generally affected by anxiety, so I thought, 'It's all, it's the end'," Chris said.
"At that time there was a renewed interest and it seems to be growing more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of the Alsterio Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, responsible for membership.
‘All reasons are different.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because it almost all started.
Others are racing enthusiasts or handcuffs – here you will find all people.
There are also those who just have an interesting vintage.
Many motors are modified, so there are no two equals.
It is not possible to change the engine and to drive 35 or 40 miles quietly within an hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved.
Some highly modified motors could reach up to 100 miles per hour."
There were failures during the week, and some motorists had to be driven.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the Italian Lambretta parents, this time the sun shines on motorists driving around Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks for a toast to Brexit's silence
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow Conservatives for a "silent period", so that the Prime Minister could agree on Brexito.
The head of the Scottish Torus said that two years after the EU referendum, there was enough time for the debate.
She expressed her opinion on Boris Johnson's words about the premier plan, which he called "unreasonable and completely absurd".
She told the BBC Sunday Politics Scotland that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At the three activists’ conference in Birmingham, she said: “In the last two years, we have had time for debate.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs served in one of the best cabinets in history and during that period a large part of the current plan, which had already been recognised last November.
The Conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the transaction and help implement plans in the country.
I think that a period of silence would be very useful."
Her comments followed a sharp criticism in Brexit's debate, which was not the first time that former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson made.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later believed that she believed Brexit and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also stated that he would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence from taking part in other elections, because in 2014 "the Scottish authorities promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
Asked about a possible re-nomination on Brexito, she said: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have not stated that a referendum cannot be repeated if you are a nationalist and the result does not please you.
I would rather, if I were to say that another referendum on Brexito could be held, because I expected another result."
Several M8 after the police incident reopened
The M8 motorway was reopened after the police incident in Glazga.
According to the police, a few hours earlier than 07:00 p.m. closed in both directions at the 15 Townhead crossing caused anxiety over the pedestrian.
The road was not closed for three hours and was disrupted in the city where the marathon "Great Scottish Run" takes place.
A man in his 20 ’ s was later transferred to the royal hospital in Glazgo.
Christine'a Blazey Ford's friend approved a statement on sexual violence suspected by Bretta Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was friends in high school with Dr. Christinea Blasey Ford, accused the candidate of sexual violence in Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that he himself did not remember the evening house through which an attack might have occurred, but believed in Ford’s statement.
Earlier, Keyser, through his lawyer, made a statement that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday attesting to the Court Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to the Keyser statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention the Keyser statement that she believed in Ford’s words.
On Friday, the President instructed the FTB to conduct a study during the week, when Senator Jeff Flake and the other senators asked to give the Senate-wide vote on Kavanaugh for a time test and a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to his lawyer's committee saying he wanted to "how to contribute to an additional FTB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“But, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or the meeting he would have had with or without Dr. Ford”, says Keyser lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser "has not rejected Dr. Ford's statement and has already told the press that he believes in Dr. Ford's certificate."
"But the simplest and unchanging truth is that it cannot approve it, because it does not remember that event," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was probably next to the attack, also claimed to have contributed to the FTB investigation.
Chicago's people report their lives with a corrupt police officer and get him
The chief prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after the dark period.
It is believed that an dishonest police officer used innocent social housing and unjustly took many people.
Until now, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida Wells, instead of the project's social housing project, has now left only empty grounds, and the former residents of Chicago policemen have used nothing in fear of being corrupt for more than ten years.
They were headed by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical body of assets abuse, police reports and charges of fraud and violence.
Willie's Martin and Cleonas Gloviers are two of the convicts who have so far been acquitted by the Attorney General Kim Foxx of the Kuko District.
“If you didn’t work with him, you would end up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and making a profit," said Cleon Glovier about Watts.
"I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that area,
But I didn't have to go anywhere," said Willie Martin.
The lawyers in the Foxx Ethics section are reviewing further 30-40 Watts-related cases.
Ida B. Wells, the resident of the social home of Landon Allen, said that many people decided not to forgive Watts.
"A lot of people didn't," he said.
"But that wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissas Baker, no one believed the inhabitants' words about a sergeant in official office.
“He has his own receipt.
Who will believe us?"
Baker said.
Joshua Tepferis, who works for the Chicago University Correction Project, says that nobody really believed in them.
"They were all tired because these people didn't seem important to them, and they didn't care, because they were black people living in social housing, so they thought they were still guilty," Tepferis said.
‘Sergeant Watts was in prison for 22 months for trying to conceal FTB informants.
Martez Wise's also put in jail thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to get back in touch with him," said Wise.
"I lost four years without a cause."
The 72-year-old Fidelity believes in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of the "Fidelity" block chains was observed until 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
The Director-General of Abby Johnson led investment in cryptocurrency – the most risky and unstable asset class in recent years.
"About two years ago, I and other senior leaders were just a bit of what's going on, especially in the Bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started by saying, and we realized that we had to find out.
Smalsum encouraged the launch of "casty" bitcoins in the New Hampshire division, when the price of this cryptocurrency was about $180.
Last December, the price was nearly $20,000, and, says Johnson, “we were amazed that the prices were rising and we started to earn, even though we never expected it. ”
She did not indicate how much bitcoins were "reckoned" or how much they earned "Fideality".
Fidelity workers are clearly interested in these technologies.
The block chain club, called "Bbits and Blocks", which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has about 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which enabled Fidelity customers to check the balance of the cryptocurrency using the Fidelity mobile software.
The possibility of victimising funds in Bitcoins was created in 2015.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible ways of using bitcoins or refused them at least briefly.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And so far, Katie Chase, the main Technology Centre for Fidelity and the leader of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-based block chains.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but it revealed that there was a great interest in customers, partners and employees.
"It's all very new.
If you enter the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find the concept evidence," said Chase.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced as to solve such problems."
So far, she says, the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects such as art works, chips or use block chains in the supply chain.
"For what it isn't in the center of attention, but I think it will finally be interesting," Chase said.
"Fidelity" will be prepared for this."
As an example, she mentioned the Pebble watch, which was completely unsuccessful in its trade standards, but ultimately bought "Fidelity".
Its group created a program for a smart clock, which was stopped after three years, collected millions through the Kickstarter project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly adapted the Pebble software for the new Apple product.
"We were not absolutely sure that the Pebble clock would be popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart clocks," she said.
"We took knowledge and were ready when the wise clocks were released into the mass market."
The island was devastated by earthquakes and tsunamis
On Friday, 29 September, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful 7.5 - foot - high earthquake that caused tsunami and killed nearly 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is expected to rise.
According to the representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, there is no electricity and communications and therefore it is difficult to assess the damage in the city and the nearby Dongal fishing community.
Californian students wore shirts with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of the KGTV, the Escondido Schools Union this week confirmed that about 10 students had taken a badly-considered decision to demonstrate racism at the event for senior classes.
"We are proud that everyone is accepted in our school and not afraid of diversity," said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez in the report.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by Escondido secondary school, union officials and local police.
"The school administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of the injured students and will be subject to disciplinary penalties," says the report.
On the basis of a police opinion report, students of the school north of San Diego wore masks with words that usually included a racist note and were photographed by their uncles.
Usually the school confirms the notes in advance, but after photographing official photos, some students choose their own words.
The Union report states that such behaviour is "unconsistent with the culture, values or history of Escondido secondary school".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Escondido secondary school will continue to flourish with family values and unity-based culture throughout the community."
The former student Cade's Panel for the channel KGTV claimed that he was upset by the offensive picture seen in the social media.
“It hurt me personally,” he said.
“It seemed funny to them, but it wasn’t.
Only fools can laugh at such things."
Shaquille O'Nealo's son, Shareefas, will pass the 1st UCLA season
The son of Shaquille O'Nealo, a member of the museum of basketball will have to spend the first UCLA season due to heart failure.
According to TMZ Sports, O'Neal will have a heart surgery to eliminate the disorder observed by UCLA doctors during a routine examination.
“Thanks to God, UCLA doctors noticed the problem early”, – O’Nealas said TMZ.
“As long as rehabilitation is done, I will attend the lectures and be a regular student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Nealas signed an official intentional protocol in August, promising to play in the UCLA team, which has already attracted no name and is one of the best first-class teams in the 2018-2019 season in the country.
"Shareef's high school was well improved," chief coach Steve Alford told reporters last month.
“He is a high school, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of the new team.
We are pleased with the composition of this year's team and Shareefas will add to it.
It has a good basis and will be able to improve at both ends of the square."
According to "247Sports", 18-year-old O'Nealas is a 4 star candidate, taking 8 place in the 2018 news rankings as a heavy country attacker and 41 place as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Nealas helped the Crossroads high school to achieve a record score – 25:9.
Sarah's Palin's eldest son is accused of violence against his father
At 28 years of age, Trackas Palin was arrested for three injuries, including assault.
On Sunday, he was arrested for domestic violence for the first time.
According to court records, the incident took place at the Palins House in Vasil, Alaska, where Trackas Palins wounded his father, Todd, before he was killed by a truck.
28 years after the Saturday incident, he was arrested for three injuries, including an attack.
The court documents indicate that the dispute began when the man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it up.
As explained in the Court’s statement, Trackas Palin was arrested for first-degree assault and fourth-degree assault and for a fourth-degree criminal offence, and his father was injured in the face and head.
On the basis of the documents, Palin, the police officers who spoke to him, drew out "prosecutions" and ordered him not to use weapons.
The Court also states that before arrest, the man was caught on the roof of the garage.
The court records Sarah Palin’s words that her son was “suffering” and “used some medicines”.
It is also noted that Tracka Palin claimed to the police after drinking several bottles of beer before.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence against women, with an obstacle to reporting domestic violence and the possession of arms.
"Seeing how my son feels about what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand the other families who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know what the soldiers are going to hurt," said former Republican candidate to Vice-Presidents and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I better understand more than ever that America needs the best leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren claims to be thinking about candidacy for the presidents after the mid-term election
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government to which women must be directed," said the Senator of Democrats, speaking to the people gathered at the Holjok Rotuš of Massachusetts.
"So I promise you this: after 6 November, think carefully about whether it's not worth running for presidents."
Warren, who tried to defend his position in the race with the Republican representative in the state of Geoffu Diehl, said earlier that I would not be running for the presidents because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and break-up as if it were the only important thing in 2020," she told reporters in August when she said she was speaking at the National Press Club.
"The next important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been regarded as a potential candidate for democracy in 2020, which can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, they would be waiting for a difficult initial election, which may include other well-known democrats – former Vice-President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
A third fatal death associated with remarkable mental health clinic in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person has been killed in a luxury psychiatric clinic for years.
The daughter of the television comedian Shaquelle Vidal (23) died on April 7, almost a month on a voluntary basis in West London, Marylebon, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) is a risk fund manager, a millionaire and a former supporter of the Conservative Party, paid her maintenance costs for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the day Daisy Boyd (28) was impressed by the highlight of the Highness – one of the founders of River Cafe, Rose Gray.
After being separated from the publishing company’s successor, Dan Macmillan (43) who suffered from the death of Dr. Boyd on 5 October died of a cancer brought illegally by a clinical visitor.
Two months ago, an artist named Alan MacDonald, who was released from the hospital four days ago, retired from his life.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not enough to prevent the illegal substances being introduced.
BBC series "Mock The Week" comedian Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle registered at the clinic on 11 March.
Last week, at a meeting of the Royal Attorney-General of the Westminster Court, Katie Gollop said that on March 29 Shaquelle left AWOL and returned to an understanding of the state of mind after a week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Ava Vidal, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, what she did and what she did.”
Ms. Lyle, she called Shaquelle a girl.
“I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle, and he was in New York at the time, ” said John Gordillo, 52.
At the meeting, Mr. Gordillo revealed that on April 4 Shaquelle called him and said he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and he called clinics "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after this call, but nobody answered.
"It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded," he added.
On 5 April, the clinic doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition is extremely rare.”
In less than 48 hours, she ran into a running computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed his sympathy to his family and friends and said: “Our clinical objective is to provide high-quality care in a safe, therapeutic environment.”

"Led Zeppelin" was again brought before the court for the allegedly stolen Stairway to Heaven guitar rifo
"Led Zeppelin" was again brought to trial for the guitar rifo used in the 1971 song "Stairway To Heaven", which the group allegedly stole.
It is said that some of the British hits in 1971 were widespread.
The Court of Appeal rejected the judgment in 2016 that the group did not copy the name of the other group ‘Spirit’.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore's trusted guitarist Spirit submitted the application.
It seems that the case of the "Led Zeppelin" song "Stairway To Heaven" will take a long time – as it does.
The group is again standing before the court on charges of stealing a 1971 ballad guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the hit from the beginning of the "Spirit" group.
It is claimed that the judge made mistakes, such as misinformed the sworn rights of authors.
It was returned to the court.
“Spirit” guitarist Randy Wolfe’s trusted Michael Skidmore made his first claim in 2015.
Police raids in Michigan ended when a police officer crossed into their suspect's murder
His girl's murder suspected of being a Michiganian was arrested after the police received him by a police car.
Adam Nolin is believed to have shot his girlfriend in Vojoming on Thursday, 33rd, in Michigan, Tia Mae Randall.
He was taken to the court on Friday at the hospital where he found the officer passing him by the police SUV car, because Nolin shot policemen trying to escape on the road where the traffic was intensive.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including assault to kill and escape from the police.
"It's not customary to go to court in the hospital, but it's not the first case," said Captain James Maguffee of the Vyoming Police.
"It is appropriate treatment, but the process of justice must also continue.
The judges often agree that this could be implemented."
Nolin's girl's body is found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot with one shot, and the police immediately identified Nolin as the suspect.
Then the police issued a public warning about Nolin and presented a brief description of the man and his black Dodge in 1996.
The man was spotted on his pickup and went off to the US 131 highway when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and his pickup went to the concrete wall, then got out of the car and let him run on the road.
As he ran away, he shot at the invading policemen.
One police officer was sitting in a police SUV car and crossing Nolin from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin has been taken to the hospital in difficult but stable conditions and will remain there until he is released and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event has shown that West Michigan police are risking their health to protect the community," Maguffee said.
"They took the man with them rather quickly and with the right measures and we are very proud of them."
He is also accused of fleeing from the police, of carrying a hidden weapon and of a serious crime committed by firearms.
He's still not guilty of his girl's murder because the investigation is still under way.
"Of course, we are still carrying out a murder investigation, which we will soon complete, so that we can submit it in time to the District Prosecutor of Kent," Maguffee said.
The judge praised the courageous man who had thrown his teeth into his house for the thief
The judge did not feel pity for the courageous man who stood up to two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one of his men tried to drive him a wooden sheet, in 63 C.E., David Oldham did not despair.
A man in charge of the university’s territory defended himself, beat both criminals, and gnashed one of their teeth.
The intruders fled, but there was blood left on Mr. Oldham, according to which four months later Craig Ford was found and arrested.
By announcing the verdict to Ford, who lost his teeth while trying to enter the house of Fr. Oldham, worth £400,000, in Ormskerke, Lankašyre, King Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t expect such a reaction from Fr. Oldham – when you caught sight of only the eyes and nose, you met him at the house, he shook you.
He also beat your partner, who tried to break into the second floor and jump off the roof.
On Friday, when Ford was sentenced to three and four months in prison, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
The first is not to offend David Oldham, the second is not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you swallow a dog.
It's still a little bit of a punishment."
He added: “I want to commend Mr. Oldham for how he responded to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that the crime had already been committed by Fords in 2016 for another invasion and had to be imprisoned for three years, but was launched in a uniform manner.
Mr. Oldhams told the king's court of Liverpool that he had jumped when he heard a noise at home on 5 April at 7 p.m.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, ” said Jones, “has courageously left the house and opposed the accused.
Fearing for his safety, he slapped him in the face, thus separating him and gnashing his teeth.
Then the other intruder jumped from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively slapped him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the companion took a wooden table and tried to drive to Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: “Call him, he has gnashed my teeth.”
The co-rapporteur said to Mr. Oldham, "If you let us go, we'll leave," and he and Ford fled the crime scene.
The police paid Ford on 2 August during the raid in the Wavertree area.
Fords beat the police dog, and then he's stuck in his fist.
It is believed that the second intruder is still free.
Fords, who did not have a permanent place of residence for 25 years, admitted guilty of burglary, robbery and dangerous driving, although he was banned and did not have a driver's license.
Two activists criticised Johnson in applause
The other activists today buried Boris Johnson when he was called "a poor and aggressive man".
P. Johnson, who was trying to convince ordinary people in his decommissioned speech about Brexit, received a strong assessment by former Minister of Commerce Digby Jones, which was also endorsed this afternoon by the participants at the Birmingham Conference.
David also attacked Mr. Johnson because he was concerned about newspaper headlines, not politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr. May, an associate in the Cabinet of Ministers added that he was simply "slow", because he was unable to be a full leader.
The opposite reaction was seen when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs again attacked the Prime Minister's Chequers plan and concluded it "insane" and "absolutely absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and this is what she did not agree with in the referendum two years ago.
It also called on the government to support ambitious projects, such as the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May rejected her criticism of political games and claimed that she was not bluffing and prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC at the Tori conference, Mr. May said, "I believe Brexit".
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, who is now acting independently, received a mine approval when he heard Brexito's perspective.
People boasted when he gave an opinion on Mr Johnson, who allegedly answered the questions of interested businessmen.
Without specifically mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he is “a weak and aggressive man”.
"Business is very important, so by saying "velliop business", the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs showed that he is really a poor and aggressive man," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also welcomed Mr May's reaction to the meeting of the leaders of Zalcburg, who had observed his speech in the Chamber, was heard by EU leaders on the "appropriations" to her cabinet plan.
The Scottish Torus leader Ruth Davidson had previously also criticised Mr Johnson, recalling that during the Brexit negotiations he was a high-ranking government official.
Mr. May's associate in the Cabinet of Ministers told MailOnline that the intervention was not very serious and Mr. Johnson did not have enough supporters between Parliament's towers to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He is noisy, but he does not have enough in the parliamentary party of supporters, and he knows that.
We see a sharp contrast between David David, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who meets his personal ambitions."
Business Secretary Greg Clarke criticised Mr Johnson, who was skeptical of Brexit's businessmen.
Speaking at the Tori conference in Birmingham, Mr. Clarke said that Mr. Johnson was "all wrong".
He said: “I am amazed that someone can think that way in general.
There is no successful economy in the world that would not have successful successful companies."
In an interview with Sky News, Redge on Sunday, Mr Davis acknowledged that the coming months would be difficult because the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to provide many benefits.
However, he believes that the government must not compromise and pursue a similar agreement to the Canadian Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Asked how Mr. Johnson was leading the towers, he did not miss the opportunity to recruit the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
Addressing Mr. Johnson's proposal to put a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the British policy gaps is for politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas are suitable for titles, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria spent £80 million on the poor restaurant of European taxpayers
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on the European taxpayers' funds for the poor old castle restaurant, which now seems to be built from "sour and cardboard".
The Balkan country has issued £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the previous size, the restaurant was in a state of shock.
The Krakra Region has promised to convert the territories of the fort.
The Bulgarian Government has issued a ten million EU million free medieval castles for restoration.
The Balkan country has spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund to restore the old castles and fortifications, but instead of returning their previous size, it has become familiar with the construction work.
Relics after the expensive reconstructions seem to be built from "sour and cardboard", so it is no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the monumentists realized that the fortress of the Middle Ages of the western Bulgarian city of Pernik Krakra and the Roman fortress of Trayanov Vrata near Ihtimano was reconstructed using polymeric concrete, most commonly used as a base.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian Government have agreed in private that lessons should be learned from this failure.
"The fortress is surrounded by state," said the architect and monumental protector Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
It lasted 16 centuries, and now it's broken."
Such reactions occurred after the Krakra fort restaurant in Pernike and therefore the local authorities promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
The Pernika fortress is listed as a “pillar from the cardboard” due to unexpected modifications.
Byzantium Yailata is a fortress built in the "Sura fortress", because it has been rebuilt from flat white blocks that are not suitable for air-affected façade.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts as to how the European Union is using the development funds.
Stylish bakery mini up to this year's "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of stylish bikers from all over the United Kingdom go to the streets on vintage motorcycles to collect money from the Movember fund.
The event is called the “Kilnaus Genentelmen’s Trip” and is organised annually to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year the bakers market in London and other UK places, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's events "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" take place in the United Kingdom and 650 other cities in the world and have so far managed to collect more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
The official event's website says that this year's event "has killed 120,000 people with blouses, signed collars, matched the tunic costumes, sat on their classic and vintage-style motorcycles and allowed them to collect funds and raise awareness of men's health, specifically prostate cancer and men's mental health".
In Sydney, the "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event was first organized by Mark Hawwas in Australia.
The idea was inspired by a picture of Don Draper of the series "Mad Men", in which he sits on a classic motorcycle with the best of his line.
In London this year, hundreds of bakers, including the heavily taxed dog Sergeant Piper, traveled to the Tower Bridge in the event.
Tennis axis Boris Beckeris revealed a treated skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked the doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
Becker’s pictures show a small patch near the sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it seems less than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
When it was discovered that it was treated with skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on his nose.
On Wednesday, he published a message on Twitter about his health: “I want to thank Martina Mayr-Brune and Dr. Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me.”

“I visited a dermatologist who removed my base cell carcinoma on Sunday,” Beckeris told the German magazine “Image”.
"It was an ordinary check and it seems less than it really is."
Base cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer in 75% of cases.
When it is time, there is a great chance of success.
Becker is currently different with Lilly Becker (42) and they reported divorces in May.
The tennis star has won six important prizes in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles and the Olympic gold medal in two races.
He was recently observed having fun with his friends at the 185th "Octoberfest" Munich.
The 24-year-old bullet sealed on an unknown train platform due to body volume
On the train platform, the unidentified British athlete decided not to miss out on the body.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal this year at the British Sports Championship, says she was attacked on Friday afternoon at Lids Station.
At the age of 24, and at the height of 11 inches, Mr. Mayho said that she was being pushed by a train without a word by a man.
About 5:00 p.m. on the platform, the male who attacked her was pulled out of the store.
However, the rising sports star, achieved a spot on the British team in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, was a man.
Mayho, who came from western York City, said: “I have been killed until others have turned their eyes on the full platform.
Such people can scare and make them not to believe themselves anymore, but it is the MANO body, the "mechanism" of MANO.
After announcing his adventure on the Twitter network, the young athlete became very popular in the social media.
MBE ordered knight Andy's Lewis to write: "Stora!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jesse. It's all right with you.
Don't let the head of an idiot spoil your mood."
Gavin Gray added, "I'm sick.
Not only because of him, but also because of the environment that ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example to a new generation.
To show that you need to be proud of yourself, and that the unhappy may be refreshed!"
At the University of Lids, Mr. Mayho was interested in adolescence and was encouraged by one of her senior sister’s coaches.
Since then, she has been able to save the second place at the British Muller’s Seniors Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championship medal just a month after her victory in the Northern England Games.
The athlete refused to comment more extensively on the event.

Now Facebook under the new European Data Laws is threatening a huge fine
After a break of at least 50 million accounts, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to obtain a security clearance account, so much confidential personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook reported the break-in only on Friday three days ago, and it was not possible to tell how many British accounts were damaged until yesterday.
Until the search for programmers continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks how the Internet giant complies with European data compliance requirements, because its headquarters is located in Dublin, criticised the company saying: "The report is incomplete."
Under the new European Union data law, Facebook is subject to a huge fine as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of the world's turnover.

The following records are heard in the case of MG Baltic: the accused questioned Gabrielis Landsberg
The hearing of the court began between the interview of former Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski (MG Baltic) and the former "worker" Vytautas Gapshi's record.
When listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what is being said.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys are talking about Christmas, and several times they are talking about the name of the current Conservative leader Gabriel Landsberg, but what exactly is being said is hard to understand.
Claims for both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, charges are made to three legal and five natural persons: the Labour and Liberal Alliance parties, MG Baltic, former Liberal and Labour Leaders, E. Masiuli, Vytaut Gapshi, former Liberal S. Gustaini, Seimas Member, Steponavič, and former Vice-President MG Baltic.
The Working Party's suspicions about the effects of counterfeiting and trade, the Liberal Association is suspected of counterfeiting, trafficking and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of counterfeiting and trafficking of these parties.
Officials suspect that the politicians had taken or had talked to MG Baltic as Vice-President of the country, Mr Kurlianski, and later proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former President of the Liberal Alliance, E. Masiulis, is suspected of having an effect on trade, plundering and illegal enrichment, the suspicions put to the vice-president of this party by misusing Mr Steponaviči, former member of the Vilnius City Council, St. Gustaini, as a bribe.
V. Gapšys is suspected of the effects of counterfeiting and trade, and Kurlianskis is suspected of the effects of counterfeiting and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest chance of winning the second presidential election tour?
The poll on the second round of elections included four candidates in the top rankings - economist Gitan Nauseda, not nominated by Minister Saulius Skvarnelis and two candidates who participated in the first elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LCD) Party - Seimas Member Ingrid Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ushakas.
True, on Sunday it turned out that the TS-LCD had received support in the elections by I. Šimonytė and V. Uschack withdrew from the electoral struggle.
As data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second President's tour would win Mr Nauseda, but the leader of Vilmorus, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says there are too many conclusions to make.
"Separate (from others - DELFI) Nausea, but it is very important to see whether parties are talking about people who are dynamic.
These were the duplicates of the Shimonityte from one study to the other, and Nauseda was halted growth, even a decrease in Ušacko.
This growth is very important to you," says the sociologist.
In addition, in view of the results of the survey, it is clear that a large percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or intend to go to the elections in general.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvarnelis were to be held during the second presidential election, the fight would be tense - 32.7% would vote for I. Šimonytė and 30.9% would vote for S. Skvarnelis.
True, even 36.4% of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or know who they would vote for, or vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that so far we do not see a full picture, because not all candidates have yet been published to apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate.
"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the candidate for social democrats?
When it is published, you will see how it is possible for him to deal with other candidates.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful until now, is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
For his part, political scientist Majzvydas Jastramski, of the Vilnius University of International Relations and Political Science Institute (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have been rejected from the fight by V. Ušack seem to be in circumstances.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The 5 percentage points difference certainly does not show any advantage to any candidate.
The only thing I could see that Nauseda would look good against Ushaka... again, in the light of the fact that those people would actually vote.
Nasseda v Skvarneli also looks good, but we are now comparing apples and potatoes because, for example, Nasseda has already announced that he will participate, Skvarneli has not announced.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the original conservative elections, how would it look after them?" - says a politician.
According to him, Mr. Nauseda has a small surplus, but when all the candidates are announced, he can cut.
"The situation is quite equal.
Nausea, Skvarnelis, Šimonytė - the results are congruent.
I would like to remind you that, after the remaining half of the year before the 2003 presidential elections, Roland Paks had 5% support to vote for it and then won the elections.
This can't be made any predictions," said Mr. Jastramski.
DELFI recalls that the candidates for the presidential elections have already been announced by economist G. Nauseda, Member of Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Member of Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of the Liberal Alliance Petras Austrevičius, Member of Seimas Naglis Puteitis and Member of the European Parliament Valentins Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempted cyberattack
"The regime in which the history of the use of cyber weapons is clear from cases such as (computer virus) Stuxnet (dissemination), this time attempted to violate Iranian communications infrastructure," - via Twitter, Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azari Yaromi wrote.
He was referring to the attack of the Stuxnet virus, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have set up this harmful program.
"Because of our technical teams' vigilance, they're left empty-handed.
We will continue to talk about this negative action in the international forums," said Mr Jahraomi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fattahi said that the technical team's presence on Monday recorded a number of attempts to penetrate their systems, but the attacks were "repeated".
In the health club "Impulse" man got sick, he couldn't recover
The accident took place about 10.40 a.m.
The swimmer in the pool (born 1945) suddenly became ill, and he scurried under the water.
The man was quickly drawn out of the water, but he was already unconscious.
He was being tried to recover.
Soon the ambulance doctor also tried to rescue him, but he was unable to save his life.
On his way to the hospital, he died in a ambulance.
Antanas Sakalauskas, head of the Health Clubs Network, commented on this disaster.
"We have found that a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabioniškių g, with his wife on Monday morning.
The pool customer sailed for about 30 minutes, then went to the pool trails to rest and suddenly fell after a few minutes.
The former people - the customer who sailed in the joint road and the pool supervisor - responded immediately, pulled him out of the water and began to recover.
The man was constantly being raised until he arrived quickly.
The club’s staff immediately called for rapid medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctor arrived, he restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him to the medical car.
In the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the health condition of the man, and unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man had not survived.
We mean a sincere pity for a dead man's family for his loss.
According to the original data, the accident could have led to health problems of the client.
According to information provided to family physicians, he has diabetes.
We remember that with serious health problems, it is always very important to assess your options and consult with doctors and health club specialists.
In all health clubs’ pool rooms, there is an awake supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of customers, and he distinguishes from other employees a bright suit.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations where they can contact the administration and the registry immediately, respond to their queries or seek assistance.
Four times a year, staff training is carried out in relation to the security programme - much more often than required by law.
During this period, workers shall disseminate theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to deal with an accident, be monitored or comply with the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal has radically solved the problem of heroin

The missing son in Norway, Grazina: he changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian
According to the press release of the LNK, Lithuania lost four years ago the right to protect her son and to see him in the decision of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the courts.
Women’s story led to an international scandal followed by the entire media.
Nationals prepared the boy's picket for his mother's return to Lithuania in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the public of Grazina and her family did not help restore a son with Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, a woman tells how she has lived apart from her son for the past few years and how she and her child meet after two years.
At the time Grazina lost her right to care for her sons, the boy was 8 years old, today is 12 years old.
For the first two years, Grazina never saw a son, it was banned.
Later, Grazina was granted the right to see her son twice a year, just one hour later.
The latest number of sights for Lithuania increased to three times a year at a court meeting several months ago and was extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son each time remind us of encounters in a prison of severe beating - followed by officers, and running into them - a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian," - the heart of this Tuesday evening will open Grazina, her story - in the LNK lecture
Eligius Massuli will not be repaid for the personal money taken through the tie
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal declared that the defendant’s complaint had been rejected.
The judgment is final and without appeal.
In the case of political corruption, former leader of the Liberal Alliance E. Masiulis appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to return some personal money - the money taken over by him and his wife's money.
In total, more than EUR 242 000 was taken over the crew from E. Masiu.
This money is subject to a temporary limitation on the right of ownership and is continuously extended.
The last time the Vilnius District Court extended it on October 15th.
E. Masiulis The Court of Appeal did not ask for all the money - it seeks to recover from the marriage money taken from the 800 euros and its money - 690 euros, 130 UK pounds sterling, 1600 US dollars.
The former politicians say that the last money was spent on the US planned trip.
E. Masiulio's lawyer Mindaugas Bleuvas requested that this money be returned on Monday at the Court of Appeal, since the spouses worked well and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius has appealed to the court to reject the complaint.
"The decision of the Vulnerable District Court is legitimate and justified, there is no limit to the more assets specified in the charges.
The Court rightly found that there were grounds for confiscation of assets, as well as for confiscation of advanced assets", Mr Laucius said at a court hearing.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to return more than EUR 242 000 to E. Masiuli, accused of political corruption.
This money is found through the harsh corruption of accusations in the old politics in the home and in the car.
The College of Three Judges found that the substance of the case shows that ownership rights are limited only to funds constituting a subject of criminal offences committed by E. Massuli.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the accused's property is not restricted disproportionately or the restriction applies too long", - is written in the Judgment of the Judges of Nijola Zimkienia, Jurgitis Kolyčienė and Fire Trompoule.
The judges pointed out that in case E. Masiulis is accused of serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex and therefore it is necessary to extend the temporary limitation period for the accused to ensure that the property is confiscated and that the property is confiscated.
The prosecutors claim that former MG Baltic Group Vice President Raymond Kurlianski gave E. Masiuli 106,000 euros for the adoption of decisions that would benefit the Group in the Seimas.
Both the defendants believe that the money to be found at E. Masiulu - EUR 90,000 - was a loan from R. Kurlianski.
According to the case, during the crash at E. Masiulu there are 242.4 thousand euros, 130 UK pounds sterling and 1.6 thousand dollars.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover the money, but the courts have rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that some of these funds are owned by other persons and are intended to invest in real estate or are owned by his family.
He also claimed that there are no data to obtain funds in a criminal way.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has announced that the charges filed with E. Masiuli show that these funds could have been received by receiving more than EUR 100 000.
Legal protection claims that the balance of the cash collected during the fine could have been obtained from undetermined sources of income, undeclared, undocumented, and perhaps no legal revenue.
In the case of political corruption, the charges are filed to three legal persons - the Working Party, the Liberal Alliance, the group "MG Baltic".
In addition to E. Masiulio, the charges were filed against the former "worker" Vytaut Gapsi, the former Liberal MEP Sharūn Gustaini, the Seimas member Gintar Steponaviči and the former "MG Baltic" Vice-President R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianski is accused of interfering with former MPs E. Masiuli, St. Gustaini and V. Gapshi.
Americans recorded dangerous Russian destroyer maneuvers
During 25 minutes of takeover, according to the U.S. military forces, the Russian Su-27 rushed right through the front of the aircraft.
The Russian aircraft passed through it for the second time, using the traction acceleration, and turned around.
Passengers reported a feeling of turbulence during the first approach and a tremor during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to practice in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on Maritime Accidents and Over Sea Prevention (INCSEA), - the US Navy reported in its report.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible collisions", notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but believed that the Russian SU-27 kept a "safe distance" from the American plane.
Parental costs are not reduced below: only up to EUR 50 per month for undergraduate activities
According to a survey by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Studies", a survey conducted at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of the parents of their one-year-old school-year-old 'purchase' before school awarded less than 100 euros, a fifth (21%) from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and a lower than a fifth (18%) for their child's training at the end of summer spent more than 200 euros.
Parents whose children started to go to first grade in this year of science have spent an average of about 220 euros on their child’s school bag, while other parents whose children have already completed their first grade have allocated a lower amount to their child’s preparation – an average of about 160 euros on average.
However, spending is not reduced even when it comes to the years of science, because parents often have to pay their children’s husbands and corporaters.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one barrel in the country may vary from EUR 20 to EUR 100.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell what average amount they plan to spend a month on their one child’s underage employment.
The quarter (23%) of the child surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month, another quarter (26%) claimed to be paid up to 50 euros, three out of the 10 (31%) allocated to the child’s class employment from 50 to 100 euros per month, and the sixth (17%) indicated that he planned to spend 100 euros or more.
True, in Lithuania children of school age are awarded an informal child education basket, which consists of 15 euros per month.
All of this money can only be used for one mate, and if the employment price is higher, the difference must be covered by the parents.
If a child visits a couple of friends or a couple of school - age children in the family, the cost of supporting the child’s activities may be doubled.
As the marketing director of the consumer loan company Vivus.lt says, Justin Ambrasienė, a small or medium-income family can save children's husbands, especially when a few children grow up in the family, may become a minor challenge.
As the academic year began, parents turned their heads to obtain money for exercises, office goods, or new sports equipment.
Now the main concern is how to take care of children after school without paying the burden.
We note that parental expenditure is particularly increased in August when it is necessary to prepare for the new scientific year, but later it remains higher than in the summer, because parents are willing to invest in their own disadvantages.
Often, in the lack of funds and in a responsible assessment of their possibilities, they are resolved and loaned," says J. Ambrasienė.

The Kaunas enjoy the fourth trilled trolley
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street in Kaunas, "Atia Old, Good News", was exhibited - an old trolley bus with drawing and inscription "Sienograph locks".
The city of Kaunas was reported to have a new trolleybus.
"This old Shkoda also changed its somewhat dazzling green color into a much more colorful and brighter dress.
It will also show the "Atia old, good news" event", - at the loaded photo written by representatives of the municipality.
Mobile street art exhibition "Atia old, good news" is designed to greet the old trolleys, which will be changed next year.
Already next year, the old Shkoda trolleybuses will be on their way to the rest served, replacing them with 85 new ones and modern Solari trolleybuses.
The portal recalls that the first trolley bus on the streets of Kaunas broke out a month ago.
On the trolebus a few well-known accents of Kaunas street art - the old man's pipe and drum.
Not a week after the first appearance on Kaunas Street, the second street artist Timothy Norville - Morphai was born.
The charm shown on the trolleybus is a yellow car, which is often referred to as just "vabal".
"You wanted to set up a trolley.
This drawing looks very pleasant, especially because it fits the trolley wheels.
When the wheels turn on the wheel, it looks like it's part of that car.
When we dyed the wheels white, we made them look like retro-styles, and it made a lot of noise.
Until the trolleybus tyres were painted, it certainly didn't look so wonderful," - how far before the portal kauna.diena.lt spoke the street artist.
And on the third trolley, the bill of 27 October was laid.
It is marmated in white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly in blue.
This is the dominant color.
On the left side of the troleibus body is one K.Doneličio g. home, on the right - central mail.
"Vabalas is my dearest so far" - Morpheus spoke of the third trolley while he left the artist Morpheus.
New Purchases

The new ground-based modern trolleys will have more seats, efficient living room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver’s workplace.
New technology and parallel renovation of the contact network and street repair work will make trolleys more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, modern design trolleybuses have a great impact on the city," said Mindaugas Grigeli, Director General of Kaunas Busi.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August of the following year, and all the old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited M. Markle's mother to celebrate together
Hercogeness Meghan has taken over the British Royal Chambers.
This proves the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British monarchy invited Doria Ragland, the mother of the Saxon Duke, to her house for Christmas, the British media.
Such honor is not earned even by the Duke of Kate's parents.
Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and other members of her family have so far been invited only to traditional Christmas prayers with the royal family.
The unlisted source of Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd is "the token of Queen's respect for Meghan".
She wants to be through the royal weddings on May.
The invitation to celebrate Christmas at the same time, in addition, has made it easier for Mr. Ragland to plan for a longer stay in Britain.
She's supposed to want to help her daughter before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should have been born in the spring of 2019.
In the greenery arena and again the swarm shows "Women's World"
After the fall routine and the most important weather, the 16th show "Women's World" is already being held, forcing us not to worry - women announce a long weekend, because even four days of the hottest fashion, style and beauty news is already here - November 8-11, in the Kaunas "Zalgiris" arena.
In the course of the year, to see the change in the face of the event, the exhibition means, not a series of purchases, but a tradition of giving time to itself.
Often this becomes the place of friends meetings and the reason to spend the day with your sister or mother.
The four days of the exhibition have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of the magic, learn the tricks of the daily appearance of the lamp, find the unchanged products, hear or try various procedures that stop the process of aging of the skin.
All this and more, he promises even 415 exhibition participants who will be waiting for visitors in all three arena heights.
For three days, seminars will be held on beauty and health topics, and on Sunday, artists will be able to hear advice on the unique image of the designer and netizen Victoria Shooter’s lips.
The majority of women in business are faced with borderline situations where stress is hampered by stable emotional and physical conditions.
For this reason, Kaunas' Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Arts and the Business Women's Network working in them were born with the idea of organizing a conference "Business and happiness. Without stress", in which discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, I'm showing up at events for beauty masters.
The long-term partners of the exhibition, the Kirpei and Beauty Specialists Association, will give the opportunity to learn two days of hair dyeing and modelling subtleties from the international Academy of Vinokurov & Friends - S. Maslov and R. Sakalausko.
To further improve the field will be a competition for the development of a variety of adventures and the battle of masterliness "Art Battle", which will remain undisputed.
It will be like a holiday on a cake to the representatives of the beautiful world, "With birthday, Lithuania", where the opportunity of a century will be possible to develop an invisible show - from body painting to dances.
Not to be forgotten is another tradition of "Women's World" - the latest collections of designers' presentations on Friday's fashion and beauty show, where they will pick up the most stylish.
And handicrafts will be waiting at the Dekostudy's creative workshops, where you can create the original interior of the house or more interesting to decorate the gift.
On the last day of the exhibition, all longcases are especially expected, as traditional visitors will enjoy the competition "Long-HAIRED WORLD LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where the new longest cash records are recorded each year.
Prime Minister: Teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after the introduction of the flat payment
Since September, the average remuneration of teachers in the country with full workload has increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulius Skvarnelis.
"It is early to say how much she (in new order - BNS) has advantages or weaknesses.
The fact is that those who have a full workload - their salaries have grown on average by more than 117 euros," said S. Skvarnelis to the government on Monday.
He called the plans of the professional union of Lithuanian education workers (LSDPS) to carry out strike due to the state payment "democratic law", but stressed that strike should not interfere with the process of education.
"All forms of protest are permitted, possible in a democratic country.
If you think you have to strike, it is their right to decide.
It would not be long before children, scientists, could be affected in this area.
If the strike is to be carried out, it must be carried out in accordance with existing laws," said S. Skvarnelis.
The Seimas approved the model of postage pay for teachers in June, which is introduced in stages from September.
Teacher payment has changed the hourly payment - the teacher's status is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher's working time shall be divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andria Navicko, is called absurd, is insulting that it has been adopted by the "buldozer" principle and announces an endless strike on 12 November.
The PSDP requires the immediate rejection of this "minute" pay system and the introduction of a flooring model with a single level of not more than 18 contact hours.
Also, the rate of fixed-term wage increases by 20% and decreases the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of training funds is being criticised, as the professions do not have enough to teach households, to divide classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and to fill the classrooms in large cities as they have been.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that the flat pay of teachers would regulate the workload of teachers and pay for all the work for the school community.
It is expected that the teaching staff will be able to make up to half the number of hours per year, the first two years of work, up to 40% of all hours.
Teachers' working hours are determined to be 36 hours per week, of which not more than 24 contact hours per week are required to teach the subject(s).
The two-hour strike initiated by the LSDPS contributed approximately half of the total number of schools, plants and non-formal education institutions in May, with about 1 thousand educators.
There are about 53,000 teachers in Lithuania.
Calls to be ready: Crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even crises can be expected within the next 2-3 years, but both the Lithuanian Bank and the Government are much more prepared for these processes than ten years ago, in an interview with the "Zinių radio" release "Business position" said the President of the Board of the Lithuanian Bank.
"Saying that the crisis is beyond the corner, I certainly cannot, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy has grown by more than 3 per cent, and we are planning an increase of 2.8 per cent next year.
The main message I would like to say to society and business - let's be ready for everything," said Mr Vasilauskas.
In his view, there are no equal crises and therefore they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis of ten years ago is that at that time the government felt that the growing economy's income would be everlasting, and this meant that the costs were planned.
As a result, expenditure has had to be cut dramatically since the crisis in 2008.
Now, says Vasilauska, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"Truth, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance varies.
We believe that we are already beyond the potential and we need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not know so," said the President of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The preparation of the country's institutions for the coming crisis V. Vasiliuskas estimates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania is very important for external factors.
The current great dragons - the United States, China, the European Union - will certainly tear us apart.
That is why we must be very careful.
When it is a small economy to say that we are solving things, it is possible, but I do not believe it," said Vasilauskas.
What lies ahead for those who have borrowed large loans?
According to Vasilauska, the European Central Bank has clearly set out a short-term strategy, and interest-change decisions can be expected not earlier than the next summer: 'The main objective of the European Central Bank is to try to manage expectations'.
The trend, which is most worrying to the head of the Lithuanian Bank, is a reduction in the labour force in our country.
"The decline in labour costs is largely due to a reduction in economic competitiveness.
In addition, this is a reduction in the food intake.
Migration has allowed this process to be somewhat balanced this year, but it does not know whether it is a long-term trend," - my Mr Vasiliausk.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, and 2.8% next year.
Swedish Conservative Leader will again try to form a government
On Monday, the president of the Parliament of Sweden, who has been in political asylum for two months after the elections, announced the second opportunity to form a government.
The Ulfo Kristerson (Ulf Kristerson) is part of the right-wing Alliance of the four centre parties, which received a slightly lower vote during the 9 September elections than the previous governing centre left coalition.
It was difficult for both blocs to resist the majority of refusals to speak with the Swedish anti-immigration Democratic Party, which is the source of the neo-Nation movement.
The first attempt by U.K. Kristerson to form a government on October 14th was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, President Stefan Lofven (Stefan Lionen) announced his failure to fulfil his mandate.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, Parliament President Andreas Norlen said that next week he would propose to Parliament Mr Kristersson as a candidate for the prime minister, thus pushing the first vote since the start of the government's efforts.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristerson as prime minister," Mr Norlen told reporters.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"The fruitless negotiations must end," he added.
Parliament's vote date is not clear yet, but Mr Norlen said that there was a 14th November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may ask any candidate to form a government with which Parliament would agree four times.
If all four trials are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third test by Mr Norlen.
Some of the Group of Independent Party and Alliance's Christian Democrats press U. Kristerson to accept the support of the extreme right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far rejected such an option.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the long term of the main-flowing party.
The ultra-legislative party, having successfully taken advantage of the voter's anger over immigration following the arrival of nearly 400 000 asylum seekers since 2012, requires influence in the decision-making of the exchange of support.
However, the members of the Alliance, liberals and centrists, are categorically opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democrats working party (SAP) has managed with the Greens and informal leftist support, but only if it maintains the prime minister's position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party have rejected such an option.
The Afghan Government delegation will participate in the peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul Government delegation will take part in the international peace negotiations in Russia this month in Afghanistan, the officials reported on Monday.
The Taliban is, in turn, still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it will hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to negotiate bilaterally with the Taliban on the end of the 17-year conflict.
The Supreme Peace Council of the Afghan Government, responsible for agreeing with the fighting effort, will send four representatives to Moscow, AFP said representative Sayedas Ihsan Taheri (Sajidas Ihsan Taheris) to the news agency.
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has avoided replying whether it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the launch of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with the Russian officials, said representative Sebaghtullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts led by the Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid said that the movement was still considering whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, who has been accused of supporting the Taliban in the past, "will definitely participate", said AFP, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The meeting was originally planned in Moscow in September, but was postponed after calling for Afghans to take the lead in the process.
The negotiations will take place during the opium.
The newly appointed US peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zalmayus Khalilzadas), is trying to persuade the Taliban to agree to negotiate on the end of the war and is concerned that the multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine these efforts.
One U.S. government supervisory authority indicated last week that the Kabul government in Afghanistan has been weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba Pchenjane met with the leader of North Korea
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Chen Unas) and President of Cuba Miguel Diazas-Canelis (Migel Dias-Canelis) agreed to expand and strengthen their country's strategic relations, the North Korean government announced on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after his arrival in power in April, returned to Pchenjana with his wife on Sunday.
He met Kim Jong Unas at the airport; the leaders joined him in the city through the towns they welcomed.
The state media in North Korea reported that the leaders held negotiations in the state guest houses Paekhwawon, stressed the shared socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on the issue of North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly rigorous.
Pchenjan, who has recently also sought the support of Moscow, is demanding a rhetorical meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maika Pompeii) and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) this week in New York.
During the weekend, Pchenjan criticised the United States for unrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
In North Korea, there is a reminder that the nuclear weapons programme can continue to be developed if Washington does not change the course.
Sanctions are an important issue on the agenda of Mr Diazo-Channel.
Last week, while visiting Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canelis discussed a contract of nearly 50 million dollars (EUR 43.8 million) worth of weapons with Russia and received a similar promise by Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and later extended, remains valid.
The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia for the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diazas-Canelis has to leave Pchenjan on Tuesday.
He will still visit China, Vietnam and Laos.

During the fire, the seventh high ceiling wall was surrounded.
Record: an athlete in 157 days surrounded Britain
The British athlete fled the sea on Sunday to the coast of England, becoming the first man to cross the coast of Great Britain.
At 33 years of age, Rossa Edgley (Rosas Edgley) spent 157 days in water and conquered 2,883 kilometers.
He was on his way six hours later, and he was on his way to the ship's support team.
In recent years, the athlete has won the victory of hundreds of colleagues in hairdressing.
He landed on the coast in the south-east of England - this is where R. Edgey started his trip on June 1.
The sportsman, who planned to sleep for 100 days, said to his trusted neighbors on the shore, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that when he got off the coast, he first felt relief.
"I was very worried that my legs wouldn't last," said the athlete.
The association in open waters pointed out that during this endurance test, R. Edgley, the sponsor of the Red Bull energy drink producer, had to face up to the most adverse air conditions, and even 37 times swallowed the athlete.
The organizers announce that R. Edgley has twice improved the longest record of voyages with interruptions at sea, which has so far been 73 days.
He also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southern and northern United Kingdom points - the Lands Endo and John O'Grouts.
This distance was overcome by a sportsman in 62 days.
Macabrian secret of the Kleboniški forest: one suspect has already been detained
It was a close family of the past, because the murdered was a little bit of a mess.
Only under such circumstances was this crime known, since there were no close relatives and no reports of it.
According to the original data, he was not too old to grow up.
Like the suspects in his murder.
One of them was arrested three months ago by the Kaunas District Court.
A second person who is suspected of fleeing to a foreign country where he is hiding from the penalty for another crime is yet to be sought.
Until it is found, lawyers are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would like to agree with many of my children
In the new building rock opera "Love and Death in Verona", the country's most prominent artists are expanding.
The artist team joins Inga Valinskienė, which has been entrusted with one of the most important roles of the artist - of course a woman will play Juliet's baby.
The important part of the team also became Povilas Meskela, who will take care of the song of the artists.
"I think the love stories from Shakespeare's time have been created many and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet", apparently, will always remain the symbol of these stories and will be built for a long time in various scenes.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these buildings", - says I. Valinskienė about a new test of the furnace.
Although a well-known woman is well-known in the scene, she has created not one role in various performances or musicals, the victim has not yet played it.
"The time to play Juliet has passed," laughed I. Valinskienė.
- I would have liked to have accepted such a proposal in my own time."
True, the victim’s character is no less important in Shakespeare’s drama, and some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The bear is not only an intermediary, a helper - its way and tone of speech, a woman's attitude to feelings and resulting solidarity with lovers gives more and more colors.
In addition, the child is also important because she is one of just two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"A victim's character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes that's why it's just more interesting.
To create a different character than itself - a serious part of the creative process.
Until now, I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me but also on the director's interpretation, - says I. Valinskienė and reveals that as the victim of Juliet's sacrifice would probably do the same.
- I think the baby heard his heart.
This is how most women behave.
That's probably how I would do it."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" of Kestius Antanel's Rock is created according to the famous play "Romeo and Juliet" by Shakespeare.
In fact, a work based on reality tells the tragic end of the two young men - Romeo and Juliet - the story of love.
The sad end of the story is not clear where the conflict between young families - Montenegrin and Capulet.
"All stories are possible at all times.
Parents who decided against the choice of children have always been and will always be.
Only today are the solutions of such problems - different, - asked if the history of Romeo and Juliet could repeat today, says the future bride of I. Valinskienė.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with a lot of things, as well as the Marches."
The main role of the actor and director in the opera directed by Ramūnos Cicēnas will be to perform Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, as well as to perform Vidas Barrekis, Kęstutis Cicēnas, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest construction of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be delivered to the audience at the end of December.
The first new-colored legendary play will be performed by Vilnius's "Siemens" arena viewers on 28 December.
The day later, on December 29, the rock opera will be shown in Klaipėda's "Swiss" arena.

"Skamp" presents a song that the video has already refused to show one television
For the 20th year of operation, the group "Skamp" this year and again began to create music intensively.
On December 26 of Vilnius Siemens Arena, the only jubilee concert "Skamp20" will take place.
This time, it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and the brave song video.
"This song is about love, so I thought that the clip should also be embedded in all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the new song and video clip idea reveals Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia manifestation in 2018 is not normal.
The new songs "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" filmed over ten different orientations and age pairs: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we believe that one day we will no longer need to discuss this," says Viktor Diawara, who created music in the beginning of the year during family vacations in Israel.
True, this video's "Skamp" has already made it possible to respond negatively - it does not want to show one of the most popular channels in the country.
That's a lot to say about our society.
Television will not show a clip because it is popular and it is not an inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that any day you can turn on TVs can be applied on the screen for samples of moustache and other violence is an appropriate content?" - rhetorically asked E. Jennings.
Ericai second and Willius Alessius: "I would like to see more people around, regardless of their social status, gender or age, with more hugs and hugs.
We are raising children and want them to grow in an environment where there is as much tolerance and as little affection as possible.
The new song and video clip we want to explore at least a little bit of our listeners' day and give them a smile."
From 1998 onwards, the group "Skamp" has been playing bold lyrics that spoke on non-popular or opium themes.
All the group's best - old and new - songs will sound loud and wide "Skamp20" concert already on December 26th in the Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It awaits all with their families and children under 10 years of age free of charge.
To the clinic viaduct - traffic accident: hit by a man riding a bicycle
A few minutes after 9 a.m. portal kauna.diena.lt version reached readers information about police and emergency medical assistance teams heading towards Kaunas clinics.
The reason for this displacement was revealed after the talk.
The Kaunas police guard confirmed to the portal that there was a traffic accident at the clinic viaducium in Utens and Eivens.
During that time, a car and a bicycle broke down.
According to the Kaunas emergency medical representative, a person who had been hit by a bicycle was injured in the accident.
Luckily, serious injuries were avoided, and open wounds were not seen on the body.
Medical examination of the injured person at the site of the accident.
Drivers report that this section of the road may be more difficult to track as a result of an accident.
Presidency: LRT No policy ownership
For the purpose of the Seimas return to LRT, the Presidency is concerned that the rulings are simply seeking to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is a non-political property, and the essential principle is the independence of policies to maintain," said Mindaugas Lingė, President's adviser for the Knowledge Radio.
However, the consultant stressed that the opposite process can be seen at present.
"It can be seen that these (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more influence.
That is what we consider to be quite critical of," said Mr Lingé.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in the Seimas are questionable and questionable because they apply to the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the management of the LRT, it should be done on the basis of expert assistance and in the search for specific aspects that hinder the smooth operation of the LRT.
He stressed that the international institutions are already stressing that the LRT should be supervised, not by the political but by the competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the findings of the Commission investigation into the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions have come to be of great criticism.
The very sceptical proposals to change the management of the LRT - reducing the powers of the Council and meeting the terms of office of its members with the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In view of this, the European Broadcasting Union has expressed its concern.
The opposition group of Seimas members asked the Constitutional Court in January whether the special parliamentary commission for investigating LRT activities and finances did not oppose the Constitution.
Foreign workers - good news from R. Karbauski
The Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Declaration of Living Place submitted by the old man Ramūn Karbausski of the Lithuanian State and Green Union Group, under which citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions.
On Tuesday, 56 Members of the Seimas supported the draft, 25 MPs abstained before 9th.
Following the discussion in the committees, the draft is scheduled to be discussed at the Seimas plenary meeting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
In accordance with the proposed project, persons who pay social security contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by the decision of the Administration of the State Social Insurance Fund.
Living and working in non-Lithuania, according to the procedures laid down by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and by the State Tax Inspectorate, would be deemed to have left Lithuania.
It's about services that people don't use.
Opens up additional possibilities to fix the fact that the man has left," - explained Mr Karbauski from the Seimas Tribune.
Such proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservative member of the Seimas, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Some Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of it," noted A. Matula.
Social Democrat Algird Sys believes that we are thus calling on citizens to refrain from obligations.
In his view, there would be grounds for the use of a health system for the intelligent.
Following the adoption of the proposed amendment of the law, persons who have moved to other countries are paid social security contributions there, no loans will be paid, and the debt administration of Sodros will be charged.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared their departure in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Register of Residents are calculated monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, the debt is accumulated.
A. Customs convicted of fraud, but justified for fraud
The Vilnius District Court has retained its verdict to deceive former prominent sportsman Alvyd Duonėla, but it is justified by the falsification of documents.
On Monday, the court’s interpreter was immediately heard.
A. Duonela has been sentenced to imprisonment for half-fourth years, with the sentence of postponement.
This year, the Lithuanian fearless induction champion was sentenced by the Vilnius District Court.
He was sentenced to half a quarter of a year's imprisonment.
The prosecutor’s case, after having examined the case, was dismissed by the Vilnius District Court, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 for the Offensive Fund.
Procurator A. Duonlėka accused him of falsifying a novel in 2013, where he borrowed 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros) from his former wife, Dalios Burokaitė.
The couple learned about this only in December 2016 when they were invited to cover the loan.
The former spouse told the husband that he had never borrowed and had never written a note.
According to the opinion of the Vilnius District Court judges, there is no objective evidence in the case that it is only A. Duonėla that data that does not match the facts that UAB "Dalezia" owes to A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
Consistent with the arguments put forward in the case by the judge and his defendant, there is no supporting objective data in the case.
Having found that A. Duonėla has only used the faked true document for fraud and has recognised that this feature - the use of the fake document - is an integral part of the fraud (in the present case - the fraud), A. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without proof that he participated in the criminal act", - is written in the Vilnius District Court's judgment.
The fires were driven to the ground by the cat, and the kneeling was heard for three days.
As reported by the Kaunas County Fire rescue board, a report was received that three days of cat beatings were blocked after the heat pipelines were changed.
When the firemen arrived, they also heard the cat whistling.
It was made clear that some days ago the heat track repair work was being carried out here.
It is expected that two floors could have been closed to the ground during the delay after the overcrowding.
Firefighted the heat track cover in the depth of half a metre and evaporated the hole for cats.
Antonino Scalia's son claims that his father's liberal protests about Kavanaugh's
The son of Judge Antonino Scalia of the Velioni Supreme Court told Fox News on Sunday that his father would not be surprised by the extreme force protest against the nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh, because Scalia felt that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general terms, he would be very uncertain about the nomination to the Supreme Court, because much is based on Roe v Wade's case – at least as far as the left is concerned," said Christopher Scalia, recalling the significant 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established in certain trimesters.
In particular, the Roe case abolished the right of all States to regulate abortions themselves and, in response to this decision, some States immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe had actually tried to solve cultural problems before Wade and in other cases, although they had to be dealt with through elections and the legislative process," he added through the presentation in the lecture "Fox & Friends."
"By attempting to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage to the Supreme Court, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes about approval have led to a more serious reaction, as judges have a role to play in the publishers of the laws."
The Republika Sasse, Senator of Nebraska, expressed a similar opinion at the meeting held this month on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are essentially not accountable and that the resulting bureaucratic issues remain before the Supreme Court, and therefore judges must take up the work that the senators refuse.
The Capitol Mountain Police arrested and accused hundreds of protestors of illegal interference with the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid an adverse reaction to unconfirmed allegations of sexual assault that he had committed a few decades ago, Scalia said that she would probably not be able to avoid noise.
Responding to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because on Thursday the senators reacted hotly and sometimes – the intruders, Scalia doubted whether all judges were of a peaceful nature.
"The judges are often upset," said Scalia, referring to the vicious disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
" True, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was different.
He tried to protect his good name from unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, a majority of the party’s votes (11 to 10) were allowed to take part in the entire Senate vote.
The Senator of the Arizona Republicans, Jeff Flake, said at a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FTB was given a week for investigations into the alleged violation of the current allegations, which Kavanaugh would make to Kavanaugh.
The study is still underway and President Short said that the Agency has broad powers and can question "what it wants".
“Schiaparelli” in a collection of ready-made clothing – fantastic finishings
Is It Possible to Insect Surrealism?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
Paris fashion houses, which Elsa Schiaparelli set up almost a hundred years ago, presented his first collection of ready clothes and gloves.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli shape of the coat.
The eccentric image of the long-skinned fashion house appeared this time and how very modern.
In aesthetic solutions you will find sensations, omers, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer to have modeled the podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali planned to reconcile art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons took this idea, working with US artist Sterling Ruby.
The legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, and the mammary dress that was created and worn out on the grounds of motive before the demonstration, wanted to take out a real mayonnaise, but did not come forward with approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not separate from the story of "Schiaparelli", said Bertrand Guyon, who has been working for the director of the creation for the last three years, speaking at the fashion hall in Waterfield.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he supported Schiaparelli in association with My Ray, and in collaboration with My Ray's Fund, he created clothes based on well-known art works.
The beautiful picture of the artist's close eyes is depicted on the masks covered with Perspex tears, and the red lips from the "Observatory Time: Lovers" style are printed on the true silhouette dress with collage.

One of Elsa's unique features was the appeal of the letter S. Her firm color – "Schoking pink" inspired her breath "Schoking".
The first hand by Guyon "Schiaparelli" with the key on the handle called "Secret".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday, a temporary shop opened on the Old Left Coast, where the Siurrealist half-week of Paris fashion was demonstrated, and for 100 € it was possible to purchase Virgil's Abloho extracts from the Ikea collection.
After half an hour before the opening of more than 500 young fans of Abloho, he rowed on the front porch without trying to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than he created Louis Vuitton's men's clothes.
This project helps Ablohui reach a wider audience than is available for luxury fashion or designer furniture.
"No one has any property anymore, but the knowledge of a certain chair can help set up a conversation at the southern table.
That's what a thousand-year-old generation thinks," he said recently.
The audience in the Marai area realized that this event in the garage would not be unusual when the models began to travel through them on wheels.
The collection of colourful male and female dresses of Viviennas Westwood by designer Andreas Kronthaler was based on the portraits of Jessicas Fulford-Dobson Kabulo.
Some women (and a few men) who were surrounded by high - floor sands rode on wheels, but on foot the platform of the underfloored heights went on their own.
After watching the show in the first row and wearing the collection dress with horse's motifs and orange cardigan through the belt, the last descent on the floor joined her husband, who gave her a flower pod.
Strong two-sided links in photos
Detroit was born and Peter Zelewskis, who lived in London, had already been established as a street photographer when he started taking two photographs four years ago.
"I like a portrait photographer and a man, there have always been twos and an unusual relationship between them, which everyone is talking about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, however, he said, "I gained independence after photographing the first two portraits and there was no way back".
In the book Zelewski's short appearance, the Twins will print 44 identical two pairs of photos and stories.
This project is more visual, he says: “It’s not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to take pictures of the impact and sensitive portraits of people.”
Employees expressed distrust of the trade union, wage negotiations
Members of the Royal Hospital College, who were not satisfied with a trade union transaction with the National Health Office for salaries, declared that after the vote they were not trusted by the Union and accused it of misappropriating claims for an increase in the salary expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after the lengthy discussions at the Royal Hospital College, when his former Secretary-General, Janet Davies, mistakenly promised members that their salaries would increase immediately this year by 3% when a 1% salary limitation would be abolished.
When the expected salary was lifted, the members became angry and forced Davies to resign, then he filed a petition and held an emergency meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which the college board expressed disbelief.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify relations, so the college will only strengthen," said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal Health College.
“The vote was made clear by the Council of the College of the Kingdom of Health and the leadership of the Council of Ministers and the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already made changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include the words of the members; we will continue to do so."
The meeting will take place next week and is expected to be attended by members of the Governing Body.
"The basis of the service is trust," said the National Health Service nurse to the Guardian newspaper.
‘The actions of the Royal College Council have undermined its confidence and therefore the Council must withdraw.
I hope that she will do the honors and listen to the request.
It is interesting whether the members of other professional unions will also pursue a reform."
In August, Rachel Harrison, a member of the National Health Service, said: “The National Health Service’s employees received salaries, and they did not understand the expected rise from all over the country.
That's what bothered them."
Before the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Care acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the remuneration negotiations in 2018 and had misinformed them.
However, it is also argued that the Royal Hospital College campaign on the abolition of the wage limitation forced the government to waive this restriction and to promise to increase salaries by 6.5% over three years.
The vote was followed by an independent study which found that the college was willing to go down in the negotiations and that Davies was accused of not appreciating the transaction in sufficient detail.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Health provided information that did not correspond to the facts and therefore the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published conflicting information on whether all employees will receive 3% increase in wages.
In the short report before the College's accession, the representatives were mistakenly saying that there was a planned "3% rise and increase in the implementation of the reform".
In fact, wages should have been gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the highest wage earners would have been immediately increased.
"Most of the information provided to the members after accession was incorrect about the implementation of the transaction (probably because it was tried to simplify it)," said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service, who conducted the investigation.
‘The ESR considers that the decision-makers were not able to explain clearly and clearly the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction and the main advantages, including 6,5 % and 29 % of the calculations mentioned during the campaign, and therefore it was not possible to make a reasoned decision.’
78% of those who voted voted in favour of the decision and 3.74% of those who took part in the vote were members of the Royal Hospital College.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of Instagram's direct broadcast by trying to "capture" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticized for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
Direct broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (according to Lohan's previously updated Instagram story), initially offered to provide a place for the family, but the situation was quickly complicated.
“Hello, everyone! I want to show you what a family I have agreed to,” she told the viewers, “these are refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before going to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
Watch the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or a computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted negatively.
"Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
"If anyone offers them houses and a place of the night, as I am now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't joke with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through Instagram.
“Look what’s going on – it’s trafficking in children. So you’re ruining Arab culture.
Take your children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Guys, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world is seeing us."
The broadcast ended in a physical confrontation – it seems that the mother had broken Lohan.
The video clips spread on social media, and some users wondered if this could not be compared to a test.
The Independent contacted Lohan for comments.
One third of the British think they'll never pay off all the debts they have.
Nearly a third of the British think that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, which revealed only the Independent, showed that the British, especially those belonging to the 18-24 age group, believe that they will have debts for life, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
Last year, the report published by the Institute of Fiscal Research states that the remaining amount of debt remains at approximately £46 000 for graduates, while the most disadvantaged students remain at more than £57 000.
The majority of graduates (81 per cent) will never pay all the debts, so the first 30 years will be forced into debt.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Statistics Department, UK family debt is a record size and the UK spends on average £900 each year more than earned.
However, is it worth worrying about this scary statistics?
Is lifelong debt simply a new way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
As an example, cars that are another major buyer are purchased from the house (if such success is achieved).
This week, Auto Trader predicted that all new cars will be purchased separately within a decade – this will be the usual way of acquiring vehicles.
EQ Investors Director and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
"It is certainly normal to have debts in these times: the credit card of the populist, the non-percentage refinancing, student loans and quick loans," she said.
"Sometimes our elders were ashamed to have debts."
In these times the debt of student loans and housing prices has become a normal phenomenon.
Moira O'Neill, head of the Interactive Investor Personal Finance Department, also agrees with this statement, believing that the results can cause anxiety.
"If you borrow a large amount that four or five times exceeds your income, it may show that additional debts will not mean anything," she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
There may be no need to observe that there is no doubt about the comments of the financial industry.
Brian Brodie, executive director of the Freedom Finance loan agency, says: "Schools are not taboo.
The loan for home repair or the purchase of a new car is no longer held at the latest.
Low interest rates have helped many people to save their savings in fixed deposits, from which there is a higher return, but not so easy to achieve saved money.
Therefore, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been taken by customers with excellent credit ratings."
Richard Haymess, Head of the Financial Troubleshooting Division of Equifax, believes that such expectations, lifelong debt-free expectations, are a real concern.
He says: “Inflation in August was the highest in six months (2.7%), interest rates rose, and the job grew little, so many people are not content to borrow without a realistic plan on how to repay debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of people in bankruptcy will increase by 17 per cent, and this is the main determining factor – the record lending of consumers."
Debt may not cause much anxiety as long as a person works and earns, but it is not clear how unrequited debt will affect his well - being in old age.
A study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, conducted in conjunction with the lending of funds by More 2 Life experts, has shown that over the last four years, unsaturated debt has increased by more than a third, i.e. more than twice as fast as the country average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than earns.
Boyle added: “More and more people spend 55 years on paying debts from pension funds, and this will affect their life in retirement.
It is usually the only savings they had to save.
In addition, people think that using the assets will go away later, but changing the available assets to a cheaper one does not bring as much money as they would expect.
If the price of the assets falls, this situation will only be difficult."
Retired to half Serena Williams sang "I Touch Myself" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" with her hands attached to her leg.
Teniso’s axis split into a clip on his Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
"This month, I recorded the "The Divines" version of the world hit "I Touch Myself" to remind women to check regularly for themselves," wrote Williams.
“So I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so, because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to do as soon as possible is to save a lot of lives.
I hope I can remind women."
Williams continued: "This music video is part of the project "I Touch My Self Project", which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – it died of breast cancer and gave us its hit to remind women to take care of their health first."
The project supported by the lower brand "Berley for Breast Cancer Network Australia" (BCNA) was launched in 2014 after the death of 53 Amplett.
The video, published by the tennis star in his Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million reviews and many patients’ compliments on how the tennis player sang the song.
"The warmest wishes for this video and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one admirer.
Another added: “Serena, it’s amazing.
20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a lump myself, even when the mammograms did not show up.
It is simply necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you are the true goddess!"
For the "I Touch Myself Project" project, Berlin also released a new "The Chrissy", which was inspired by the rock star.
100% of the profits received after the sale of the basket will be sacrificed by BCNA.
It is important to know for sure what signs and symptoms to be looked for.
The signs of breast cancer are not only smallpox, but also altered breast size or shape, rashes or scars, sneezing from the muscles, swelling of the skin surface, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, cancer can be a warning of swelling of the wound or the key, swelling of the vein, and swelling of the throat.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
After any signs of breast cancer have been observed, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by your family doctor, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to take a ketchup
Adam Driver was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes are usually not related to a specific current event – like the new exhibition called "The Day of the Career".
Imagine the U.S. high school day when students bring their fathers, and the teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnate Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driver), would speak.
In Lazdela, the founder of Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, the actor Daniel Plainview of the film 'Buse of Blood', illustrates how he managed the oil industry.
"I was born seven months early," Parnassus tells his students.
“Incubator technology was just invented, so I was put in a pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones didn't grow like this, but not my spirit!
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidy Bryant, acting as a teacher, are just not funny and cannot look at the driver in the eye.
However, the posters of the actor "Star Wars" only escape and he begins to tell about the personal war with another oil magnet H. R. Pickins.
"I know your ring!" he sighs.
"I filled her belly with my stirring seeds and ruined your boy -- this is my final battle, H. R.!"
In less than five minutes, Parnassus became the same memorable person of Adam Driver as Kyle Rehn from two films.
"Be cursed, H. R.!"
Kendrick Lamaro songs: Eight unheard of songs appeared on the Internet
Looks like a lot of Kendrick Lamar songs were lost.
On Saturday, eight unheard of works by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas were performed on the Internet.
It is unclear where the songs came from, and the title of the set “Bad Kid Chill City EP” and the illustration of the top (probably created by the fans) are not official.
Only demonstrative and uncompleted versions of songs that sound as if they were recorded at different intervals of Lamar’s career may be lost.
"Gang Member" could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and "Heroin", sung together with the SZA, is similar to the music track "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs shall be distributed on the market:
‘Gang Member’;
‘The Only Nigga’;
‘Want In Life’;
"Loved Ones" (with SZA);
Own This City;
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar's representative for the comment.
Opinion on the music "Chicaga": There are no tickets left in Klaipėda, inviting you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanians want to see Klaipėda's public music theatre music "Chicaga" - not served.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musician of all time has made another tour of the country's largest arenas.
However, after about 1.5 months of appearances, the rooms take place.
The organizers announce that all tickets have already been sold to the music in Klaipėda's "Swift" arena, and the tickets are quickly dissolved to the appearances of Kaunas "Zalgiris" and Vilnius "Siemens".
There are no tickets in the city for some time now, so all those who want to see this uneasy music, we invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where the tickets are a little bit more.
The demonstrations will take place in December, so when you come from here, not only will you see our music, but you will also have a great opportunity to look at the eglutes of the largest cities in the country", – the music fans are offered the outcome of Klaipėda State Theatre Manager Laima Vilimienė.
In December Chicago, viewers will see how many artists have changed their composition.
One of the main musical roles was first entrusted to the actor Tom Giab.
The talented and well-known actor from TV screens in Chicago will be the unrepeated Billy Flynn - the best and most influential lawyer in Chicago, without the twisting of people's fates.
Since the music of Klaipeda State Music Theatre "Chicaga" is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the status of the artists appearing in it is also higher than the one shown in Broadway.
In the Lithuanian Chicago, there are half a dozen artists on the horse.
The main role of women is to trust the wonderful music soloist Beatai Ignatavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and the charismatic music soloist Gabrieli Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart) of Klaipėda.
The Chicago music depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the third decade of the 19th century, which transforms the prison walls into a mountain of stars.
This is the musical content of criminal justice, telling of two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
Music is overcast by sexuality and irony.
It doesn't matter where the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - life is meant to shine in the bright star.
Their life is life because of the message on the first page, because of the title, the flashlights, the glorious wings...
On December 13 "Chicaga" will be shown in Klaipeda's "Swiss" arena, on December 18 - Kaunas "Zalgiris" arena, on December 20 - Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
The ticket is "Ticketa."
Website furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we allow time with friends, guests and so on. Therefore, it should be installed in such a way that it is not only convenient for the owners of the apartment or home, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the walls, the decoration of the ceiling, the taste of the owners, the relevant furniture should be selected.
The site should be not only beautiful but also convenient.
The best help is to invite an interior designer, which will help to optimally fill the space so that it will not be overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is recommended to first set the main point of the site, i.e. the item to which you combine furniture, other details.
This may be a church or other important site interior accent.
It would also be great to create a chat room where guests can communicate comfortably so that they do not be distracted by outdoor furniture and so on.
Sofos, chairs should be set close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
The layout of furniture must therefore promote communication, unite people, not distance them from one another.
Do not push the furniture next to the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance between the walls.
Although the room is small, at least some space is left from the wall, do not attach furniture to it.
If room space is large, leave more space than walls.
In fact, the longer the distance, the better.
When setting up furniture, use the balance sheet
Consider various details that will be on your website. Size and location.
All elements must be negotiated.
Website furniture shall be compatible with the interior details.
Possible low contrast.
He'll live inside the site, but he shouldn't be too big, because the interior will become unpleasant.
We always advise to consult interior designers.
By creating a site interior yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you may be tempted to turn to extremes: or you will create a boring interior because you are afraid to experiment, deceive, choose incorrectly, or insist improvise.
Appropriate lighting
This is a very important thing.
The different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be set at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on- floor lamps.
The Prosecutor’s Office has appealed a judgment justifying the LKF’s leaders
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office appealed to the former heads of the Lithuanian basketball federation (LKF) to justify the decision of the Vilnius District Court.
As the prosecutor's office reported on Monday, the complaint states that the municipality of the town of Panevėži had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panevėži.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was established that, in order to find the possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sale contract was concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian basketball federation and the municipality of Panevėži.
The prosecutors argue that the services which the federation was required to provide to the municipality of Panevėži city under that contract were not intended and could not be provided because the intended services had already been received or planned to be financed by the State and sponsors, some of the planned events had already occurred before the signature of the contract and had already been paid out of other funds and some of the events had already occurred after the VAT invoices had been issued - the cash invoices have been transferred for the events that have not yet been made.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor’s Office argues that the judgment of the Court of First Instance stresses that the State itself has obliged and ordered the municipality of the city of Panevėži to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since there was no State obligation for a particular hotel, only a proposal was made to the municipality of the town of Panevėži to resolve as quickly as possible the development of the hotels needed for the championship.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Court found that the leaders of the LKF and the municipality of Panevėži tried to fulfil the State’s obligation without having legal access to that because the data in the case showed that there was an opportunity to hold a European basketball team in other cities, without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, by appeal, requests the annulment of the judgment of the Court of First Instance and the adoption of a new - guilty - judgment on seven natural persons and one legal person in this case.
The Vilnius District Court on 15 October for all crimes committed fully justified the LKF Secretary General Mindauga Balchiūna.
This case relates to the preparation of the 2011 European Men's basketball championship in Lithuania.
Mr Balchiūn was accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor’s Office, Mr Balčiūna, accused him of having agreed with the finance manager of the federation and executive director on behalf of the federation to include non-conformity works - transfer documents and other financial documents and accounts provided to the municipality of Panevėži.
According to a preliminary investigation carried out by the officials of the Department of Special Investigations (STT) of the Panevėži Board, the funds of the municipality of Panevėži City could have been misleading and false documents for the benefit of LKF managed and later used by Via Unica for the reconstruction of the hotel "Romantic".
The head of this hotel, Dalia Kuklierienė, is accused of paper - she is suspected of giving television to Mr. Balchiūn as a bribe.
All the persons who are entitled to justice with Mr. Balchiūn.
The charges in this case were lodged to eight natural persons and to one legal person - the Lithuanian basketball federation.
Remote Workplace - Like Bermuda Triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed in work from 1992 to now has exceeded the total population of the city of Alyta and reaches about 83,000.
If the specific physical workplace and its safety requirements are as clear as possible, the choice to work remotely from home, public spaces or even other countries becomes a new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance professionals, although the Labour Safety and Health Act provides for remote workers to establish safety and health conditions that are not different from those of other employees in the company, the diversity of modern forms of work may lead to many issues, the press report states.
In the event of an accident in the home, the employer pays compensation for the first two days after 80% and for the remaining period of Sodra.
If it is found that an accident occurred at work - since the first day of unemployment, Sodra compensates for 100% of the wage.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by BTA, it is clear that an absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at work.
This is most often a variety of physical work, where the risk of injury is higher: it is treated with caution with devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, offices that now focus most of the best-paid professionals are also facing the challenges of employers and the workers' very popular freedom of mobility," says BTA Head of Human Resources Management, Jevgenija Krištiūnė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends a clear regulation of employee duties and limits of liability, the definition of working time, place and functions, which also applies in the form of a remote job.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
Situations and nuances are really different, each case being dealt with individually.
Employees have often heard of the responsibility of the employer when going to or from work or when traveling to or from work for accidents.
However, there are a lot of nuances and provisions in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate conversations, to make it clear and to make it clear to both sides clearly and acceptably what situations are really considered to be accidents at work, and to which the status of domestic injuries will already be affected", says the expert.
Mr Krischiūnė claims that, at these times, when the performance of functions is often fully sufficient for computer and mobile phone and for a stable internet connection, the worker will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Employees are mobile, they can choose to work at that time not at home, but by having coffee in the café or in the park enjoying the sun.
Is this gonna be a job or not?
What if the hours still under consideration are not in line with the agreement?
There can be indeed no significant situation, whose circumstances help to clarify the research being carried out, initiated by the "Sodros" or the State Labour Inspectorate", - says the specialist.
In its view, in a financial sense, the main difference between work and home is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
Mr. Krischiūnė acknowledges that there has been an informal hearing of unpleasant experiences, when employers are trying to hide the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and are trying to persuade workers to contact doctors at work, to assume responsibility for themselves, thus exasperating themselves financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: this is also an employer's civil liability insurance for workers, the acquisition of accident insurance from injury, disability or even death, as well as the current and health insurance," says J. Krištiņė.

Lithuanian visual selection - Polish lessons
The European Trophy division of the Lithuanian Regbio election has so far been difficult to match to higher-level competitors.
The Trophy Division in the Old Land is the third in capacity after the six-nation tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 ground-based teams competing.
The Lithuanians started a solid victory on October 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend, Lithuania's elected public in Lodzė, where it doesn't fit the Polish election - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were self-defensed, the riots often violated the rules and the Polish policemen were forced to strike in front of them.
At 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of the fine, Wojciechas Piotrowiczius was executed, giving his own 12 points.
In the first row, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card by Tautvyd Mažylis.
In the second row, the guests had several attacks, but they failed to finish them successfully.
At that time, the Poles were able to break up the defense of the musicians.
In the accounting area, the cumulation was carried out by Mateuszas Plichta, later by Krystian Pogorzelskis and Mateuszas Adamskis.
In addition to several important drivers, Lithuanian election coach from PAR Ntand Manyosha acknowledged the advantages of the competitors and said that such competitions provided a lot of valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and were interested in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these competitions.
We have just risen to this higher level and we need to understand it.
We won the first match against the Czechs, but now we have a very powerful match and we have to recognize their advantage.
Poland's electorate has provided us with useful lessons", - spoke a specialist from PAR, to stand at the Lithuanian electorate for four years.
Next match "Trophy" division Lithuanians play on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing in this division.

Japanese Coast Guard is looking for the missing islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to a small island in northern Japan in 2014.
Little, insignificant and worthless island, which was basically inappropriate for life, was very important to Japan.
It is so important that the territory now covered by it is under intense scrutiny - will it still occur?
Why does Japan need this island?
You're not going anywhere.
It is likely that the ice and the floodwaters covered this island all the time, although it was still raining almost two meters above the water surface.
There is little doubt that the island is simply broken, but at least its tracks are expected to be found.
When the island began, no one knew exactly - it was so worthless that no one could do too much for it.
Likely the first Japanese fishermen to learn about Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, who sometimes used the island as an auxiliary visual navigation tool.
Its disappearance is not even a tragedy for these fishermen, because there are better ways to catch where fishing can take place and where Russian waters begin to quarrel.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakit Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the western coast of the island of Kuril.
This island chain, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, and Japan - the Northern Territories.
The conflict with such breaks continued since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force was acquired in the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these territories, but historically Japan believes that the islands should belong to them.
The point is that the Japanese have been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to form a map, took more detailed studies, registering a large number of small halls.
The agreements signed in 1855 between Japan and Russia indicated that the ancestors belonged to Sachalin and Japan belonged to all the Kuril Islands.
So these two states lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Sachalin in the war for Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Kuril Islands.
Japan, unfortunately, does not mean a lot of claims to the whole island, although there were the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturupo, Kunashio, Shikotan Islands and Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island was the first to investigate, and it belonged to Japan in accordance with the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered to share these four islands at a level, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now the islands that are starting to exist, this geographical link is as if lost.
That physical marker went off about Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a major loss, which is why the rest of the island is being sought.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the definition of a simple island - it must be dry.
This means that the Japanese territory will be slightly reduced and that the exclusive economic zone will be significantly reduced from borders.
It's just interesting what you expect the island search mission - because it's really not going to be this way.
Unbelievably drama in Lithuanian and Polish boxing bins
More than a week had to wait for the final verdict of judges who had become the winners of a cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing elections.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian twins were organized in Poland.
Four Acostas won both Lithuanians and Poles.
Finally, the final decision of the panel of judges and the competition secretariat was reached at the end of the decision.
The event started with Lithuanian boxers' victories.
Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight up to 52 kg) was sure 3:0 defeated Jakuba Surma, soon Edgars Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the fight of the enemy 2:1 defeated Radomira Obrušniak.
Two master victories followed: Damian Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Manta Dužina, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 prophesied Simon Banius.
Vytautas Votes (up to 75 kg) returned to Lithuania's vote.
Lithuania 2:1 defeated Bartos Golebiewski.
In another battle, Piotrs Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) in the third round clearly defeated Eigrida Kasmova and the result was again equal to 3:3.
In contrast, he followed the brothers in Jokul.
Robert Jokulis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Kolton, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) had already to recognize the advantage of Adam Koliki in the first round.
Most of the discussions led to the battle of Tado Tamasausko (up to 91 kg) and Mikhal Soczynski.
It is due to the publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting that took more than a week.
One judge awarded a victory for the Pole, two judges for Lithuania, but the point of the technical error for one judge for Lithuania was read out to Mr Soczynski.
After the long-standing struggles, the victory left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the Lithuanian and Polish elections, the owners searched for the result of a win at 10:8 (the winner is awarded 2 points).
They managed to compensate the Lithuanians for the horrific loss experienced by the last mother.
In 2015, at a meeting in Marijampola, Lithuanian boxers won even five fights out of six and scored a win at 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian election leaders in Poland was a general repetition before November 14-17. The Lithuanian Boxing Championship in Šilutė.
After the country's priorities, a new Lithuanian box will be formed, which will protect the country's honour in the next year's World and European Championships.
How does the dog determine the direction in which the man went?
You already know that the dog bear is extremely sensitive.
They may employ hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even detect diseases by breath.
Dogs are well-known for their performance in films, but their work is far more serious than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the trail left?
In fact, this question is something more difficult than you think.
The follow-up consists of three steps – finding, setting and tracking the direction.
The second step is far more serious than the other two, since it is difficult to decide which direction a person took.
Because there's not a second between the different steps, so their smell doesn't stand out very well, does it?
Not exactly.
In 1990, the Oslo University study described experiments that led the dog to a 90-degree angle on the human path.
Tests shall be carried out on grass and on asphalt.
And in many cases the dogs easily identified the direction of the man’s way, even when he tried to mislead them by passing the mirror.
Can you imagine how difficult this challenge is?
The difference between the following trace smells is very small and in time it will decrease even more.
However, scientists say that this is not so strange - dogs could say and what part of the foot of the ground was first.
This is because their shoulder is an incredible tool.
Dogs in the brain dominate the areas responsible for the bear (as the regions responsible for the vision in our brain).
Dog nose has 125-300 million smell receptors.
Generally, dogs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but they play an even greater role in their ability to interpret different scents.
At that time, scientists carried out analogous experiments and with bicycles left behind, but it was far more difficult for dogs to track them.
This is because bike cancer is not segmented as a current human footprint, so it's harder to isolate different places for comparison - it's not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the owners of the strongest bear.
This title would probably be in line with the curves.
Hundreds of miles [100 km] of white beaks are followed by pregnant women who are ready to mate, and the red beaks catch up with an enlarged animal for up to 30 km.
In private forests promise to regulate the crossings
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday to Seim about the crossing of forests.
At the end of August, public dissatisfaction arose over the forests crossed by Labanor Regional Park.
For the month, the logging of these forests was stopped.
The Minister has acknowledged that the investigations of the attacks in Labanore have shown that no serious violations have been committed.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced a part of the restrictions in view of the proposal by the Working Group to tighten up the forest sector in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister promises that other legislation to adjust forest crossings will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are intended to be applied to the use of landfills in public forests in private forest management.
Agnė Jagelavičiūte revealed the strategy of bringing together 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want, and at the same time put what they want into the LRT TV show "Cultural with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, she gradually built up a large minority of admirers.
"At first, the pleasant taste of man, the pace of himself, and in time that taste improves a little," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in his Facebook account - she has reached such a number using a certain strategy: "At first, the pleasant taste of man, the pace near her, the pace of the moment is improving."
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims unhappiness and therefore shows his face as he is, - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria in the social networks of popularity.
She notes that there is no human culture left on social networks, because many internet users are turning to them to get angry or to read the comments of other people who are upset: "For example, there was a time in adolescence when I wanted to hang around with everyone and change - now I don't want to do it."
"Unreal life is the worst thing.
And in social networks, that's a lot.
Faisbuke is a little less than an instagram," she says.
For the education of interior design and painting, A. Jagelavičiūtė says that she is sending a specific message on social networks - about women's emancipation.
It also promotes the production of journals and looks at creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is a pure art expression, but I know there's really a lot of it there.
I believe that there are many creations in my work as well as emptiness.
I'm balancing, that's my key to those big numbers.
I don't want to create a real life.
Where it's better to give people what they want, and quietly engage what they want," says Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events attracting young people is classical music concerts.
It has been suggested that people should increase their popularity through life stories: talk about the past, the failures, the life events that remain so authentic.
That is the strategy that Mr Jagelevichiutė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, no one has any choice but to enjoy it and to show true values, culture has no choice.
"How is a boring teacher against students - is there a chance?
If we do not find a way to deliver that art, advertise unadvertised, yet nothing will be done.
When we're real and get the reader, maybe someone's gonna change.
I've got it once, second, third - and it's addiction," she said.
Three people went down to the helicopter in the Lithuanian Gulf north of June
On Saturday after a helicopter crash to the north of June, a search started in Alaska for three people.
One man was saved after the disaster on Friday, and the other three failed to find him.
The helicopter crashed near the Lithuanian Gulf, to the north west of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a long journey to Grand Preri Texas.
On Friday, the aircraft was found 100 feet from the coast.
According to the Associated Press, one person saved was 14 years old.
She was reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers flew in the fallen helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Joshua Pepper (42) and Andrew Pepper (11).
It has been found that the elder Pepper is the director of the construction company of the Alaskan company "Davis Constructors & Engineers".
I don't know what caused the accident.
The National Transport Safety Board has stated that the investigation has been initiated.
"I was a helicopter that was completely new – just from the factory, two adults and two teenagers were flying," says a report by the Coast Guard Officers on the basis of KTVA.
The pilot was found to have had 40 years of experience in flying fixed aircraft and helicopters, including flights to Alaska.
According to the Anchorage Daily News, Jeff Brodsky's family friend said that his neighbors "have not yet lost hope that a miracle will happen".
With the help of the coast protection helicopter, the rescuers updated on 17 February 2016 the search for experienced mountain climbers from Nevis fort Viljam, Scotland.
On Saturday, three people were searched for after a helicopter crash.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
The President's adviser Kellyanne's Conway revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the heated dispute between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accuser Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was upset to discover that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and defended Mr. Kavanaugh against Mr. Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge had been charged with sexual violence by ignoring the facts of the accused.
“I am very touched by the victims of sexual violence and violence.
I experienced sexual violence," Conway said on Sunday at the State of the Union.
"I am the victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We ourselves must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in prison in Pennsylvania last week.
Conway also criticised the Senate Courts Committee because it failed to remove former President Bill Clinton, who took up oral sex in his office and lied to the U.S. people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s shows shared the US public
The Americans do not agree with the testimony of Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford – the accused claims that the judge sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.
Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s lies almost match: 38 per cent of respondents claim that Kavanaugh was probably or undoubtedly lying when giving evidence, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Court Committee heard the two parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diane Feinstein with detailed accusations to the judge.
After the letter was published, both Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak before the committee.
In giving evidence, Ford claimed 100 per cent true that she tried to attack Kavanaugh, not another person, at the beginning of the 9th century.
In the emotional introductory language of 51 C.E., a woman said that she felt a civil duty and could not keep quiet.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civil duty to tell me what happened to me when Bretta Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women, who refused to accept the charges of sexual violence, said that Kavanaugh “never sexually assaulted anything in high school, college or any other time later”.
“All the way you tried to find something that would prevent you from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic it is or how ugly it is,” he said.
"It's the simplest dirty last minute."
The survey conducted on 27 and 28 September by YuGov, involving 2,607 people, did not produce any results: democratic leaders believed ford (73 per cent) and Republicans Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although ford showed more republicans than Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The exhibition's founder "Body Worlds" called "Daktaru Mirti" wants to be cut and demonstrated in its own exhibition
The German scientist who discovered the plastication, who died, wants to become an everlasting part of his exhibition "Body Worlds".
Guntheris von Hagens has devised an innovative method that allows the demonstration of valves, shells and organs around the world in a show, a welcome and admiral, and contradictory assessments.
A 73-year-old cancer - dying man told his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibit at the Body Worlds exhibition, which will be opened this week in London.
"In this sense, it will be the end of his life.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express recognition and love" – Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that the man had given strict instructions on what to do with his lavatory, and the whole process would take about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries should be removed and silicone should be placed in the body and placed in the right position.
“He said to me, ‘Angelina, you can freeze me up to –25 degrees of Celsius for a year, but then you have to add your hands, or else I will freeze.’
So I'll be able to make a mistake for a year, and then I'll have to take it."
Then, in the most ideal case, he will join the exhibition in the pavilion of London by other bodies, fortified in time with upright poses, such as horses playing or playing cards.
Von Hagens boasted a broadcast in the United Kingdom through direct British television broadcasting (this was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
Since 1995, more than 47 million people have visited Body Worlds worldwide.
Founder of Body Worlds London Peter Tabernals told The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibits took about 28 000 square feet, exposed to the donor people who "gived consent because they wanted to help the living, light them and help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are dying.
None of us will avoid it, death is common to all of us, and I think Body Worlds shows that there is no need to be afraid," said the Tabernacle.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten the court's claim for the use of charges
The Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers said on Friday that the German newspaper, which printed "evidently illegal" U.S. claims that Ronaldo had been arrested in 2009, would be brought to trial.
One of Ronald’s lawyers, Christian Schertzas, stated that the article “Der Spiegel” was “an unacceptable statement of private charges” and that he would seek legal redress for his client.
The application was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo, representative of the Gestifute company, in response to a request to comment on the article "Der Spiegel" published on the Internet on Friday.
The Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not self-check.
Deer Spiegel first published the charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo earned five times the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he moved to the Italian Youth from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the Der Spiegel statement.
The Journal announces that the suspected exploitation took place in the hotel room of Las Vegas in June 2009 – that was said by the defendant lawyer Kathryn Mayorga Leslie's Markas Stovallas.
Stovallas told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga did not agree with the court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for $375 000 paid to Ronaldo.
Stovalls immediately did not respond to Reuters e-mails about comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls from the home phone.
However, Stovallas told the journal Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to nullify the confidentiality contract.
Mayorga told the magazine Der Spiegel that the contract would no longer be signed, because it has so far felt the consequences of a previous night nine years ago.
"I've been through a serious crisis," she said, "Der Spiegel."
“And also, the charge of exploitation.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the #selfpub3.0 website, explains for the first time in detail how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The founder of the Independent Creator Union, Orna Ross, has been recognised for the first time in the 100 most influential people's edition, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trends in use, such as popular personal trademarks, responsible use and reading by mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies create a particularly favourable environment for the business of developers," says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers, and by those who know their powers, who understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of employment through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
You can earn from direct sales, subscription models, focussing aid, broadband models and other sources of income, such as online training and the activities of the relevant entity.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in the most diverse formats for the wider audience using retailers and other services.
The main objective of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage a change of mind and to learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, would not be passed on to another company without any thought, such as a specialised publisher or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this may increase their income, impact and impact, and these methods should be considered not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; it also stressed that genuine independence of the creators (as well as other people) ensures commercial and creative freedom.
Come here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing as required.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of books for e-book readers and telephones in online bookstores.
Now begins a new, Self-Publicing 3.0 era in which independent publishers will be taught to start a business of perspective and sustainable.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only world non-profit organization that unites independent writers.
The Union’s objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-up developers to sell books and encourage developers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
After hearing the plans of the populist government to significantly increase deficit expenditure next year, the President of Italy and the head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt should be managed.
The ruling parties (opposing movement of the Five Stars and the Northern League) submitted a 2019 deficit proposal late Thursday evening, which would achieve the deficit target of 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration target.
This report broke down the market on Friday and stimulated the sale of bonds and hit bank shares.
Furthermore, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and supervises how they are complied with.
Addressing the audience in the President's Chambers, which mentioned the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Matarella said that according to the country's basic laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt is managed".
"This is how we protect our citizens' savings," he said.
A little later at the conference in central Italy, the President of the Italian Bank, Ignazio Visco, said that it is no longer possible to continue to raise the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major European Union economies and is reaching 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," Visco said, based on the state knowledge agency Ansa.
"The school must be reduced consistently."
The Head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis replied to Matarella's words that the debt increased by one year according to the strict requirements applied by Brussels.
"Take it easy, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The debt of the State has been cut off over the year by the European budgets, and we are finally changing our plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco said, the Five Star Movement Commander Luigi Di Mayo said that the money stolen before would be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government was not going to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pressured no group-related economic minister Giovanni Tria to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media claimed that Matarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 per cent of GDP.
The Presidents of the Parties and the Central Bank shall not directly affect economic policy.
The President of the age of 77 may reject the law and return it to Parliament but only once.
Parliament can then re-adopt the unchanged law and legislate it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors have passed large waves
The Indonesian geophysics agency withdrew the warning of tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then a severe earthquake followed by a massive wave to the northeastern coast of the island of Slaves, where hundreds of people died and thousands were left homeless.
Car decks after the tsunami of Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the 7.5-point earthquake and tsunami that hit about 1,500 km (940 km) from Jakarta to the city of Palus, at least 384 people died.
Officials said on Sunday that the number of victims is likely to increase.
On Friday, many gathered at the festival on the beach in Palu, where many of the six - foot (18 - foot) - high waves hit the couple.
On Saturday, the geophysics agency BMKG came to the critical social media: many people were wondering if the tsunami warning had been revoked too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor, approximately 200 km (125 km) from Palu.
"We do not have observation data from Pala.
That is why we had to take a decision based on the data we had," said BMKG, Head of the Earthquakes and tsunami Center Rahmat Triyon.
The nearest flood meter, measuring the changes in sea level, only determined, according to him, a "unsignificant" wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not notice the huge waves near Pala.
“If we had a flood meter near Paul or had received data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to consider this in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunamis hit Paul and the surrounding areas at a high speed — hundreds of miles per hour, but it is not clear whether it occurred before or after the warning.
The residents are checking the mazes on the street looking for their family members after the tsunami of Palu, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"On the basis of videos broadcast on social media, we believe that the tsunamis occurred before the official cancellation of the warning," Triyon said.
Most of the damage was caused by a 9.5-ball earthquake on the second day of Christmas 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed about 226,000 people on the Indian coast, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is near the narrow bay of Slaves Island in the north-east.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the city was gunned down in 1927 and 1968.
According to the Oxford University of Geophysics researcher Baptiste Gomberto, the earthquake should not have caused tsunami.
On Friday the earthquake occurred due to a horizontal fracture – the nearby tectonic plates felt horizontal rather than vertical, as usual for the tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a decline in the sea, a flood of water and a tsunami," he said, adding that the force of waves moving along the coast could be concentrated in the narrow bay.
The representative of the disaster reduction agency Sotopo Purwo Nugroho told the correspondents that his team was "ready to send easy-to-understand public warnings", when the tsunami warning was abruptly revoked.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the residents were sent a message of warning again, but Nugroho said that the electricity and communications lines of the earthquake area had been cut off and there were no sirens off the coast.
In the social media, the Indonesians doubted whether the BMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning and resented that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm disappointed... the warning was revoked... and the tsunamis still happened..." – Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duet is going to crash ticket sales records
After a fourth match on Saturday, Francesco Molinaris and Tommy's Fleetwood became the first two of Europe, won in all four pairs, and will probably be recorded in history, because representing Europe is already the first result of 10:6 before the Ryder Cup final.
By defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau at 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four cats.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
Grieving results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
Three times the couple won 14 important titles, winning Woods twice against Patrick Reed.
They also sought victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas – this week's U.S. team won three other matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points from five possible points in the Sunday unit competition.
Fleetwood has already won the main points in the Ryder Cup unit competitions as a new European.
A couple of new patients from the Mollywood industry did not seem to be able to lead the European teams forward.
The news from Ryder's cup, such as Fleetwood, is not expected to be like this, and Molinaris did not win any of the previous six cats and landed in four races.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, known as the Le Golf National square as its five fingers, and here in 2017 won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a resolute temper during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature in the open field where high grass can lead to a loss, as American failures have shown.
These characteristics of players and the harmonious game in the field made them invincible.
"I now feel a little sensitive and only on Saturday," said the broadcaster Fleetwood, playing with a broad smile all weekend.
This afternoon we turned out to be good, stable, and good.
If we get to know each other in history, it'll be a great achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
Molinari also enjoyed it.
"It was great playing with Tommy," he said.
"But we have to carry out our duty, not only to access the record books, so tomorrow we will have to struggle hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it will not be easy."
Ritter's hot!
Irish village in the middle of a combat field
The Claregalway Castle in western Ireland was once powerful, the main fortress of the 15-year-old family of the English Rite, and this Saturday was remembered for its origin.
Ritter's two-armed soldiers during the Middle Ages fighting festival at Claregalway Castle in Golvey, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
The fully restored Anglo-Norman house with a forest is turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all over the world have restored contact fights and games that were popular centuries ago.
Ritter-dressed Karl Dornán and the costume of the war to be dragged by Donna Dornan patrol the great art of the Claregalway Castle during the Middle Ages fighting festival in Golvey, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
"It's a great weekend, and something is unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald of Keri's graphics, who became a housewife for the weekend.
"That's how we get back to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything the right way," said the theatre employee, who was the first to participate in the armed fighting festival.
The field was packed with authentic colored fighters, and although their swords were a book, some of the helmets were folded, and one injured the mouth.
The riders demonstrated their skills by jogging and cutting their shoulders and backs across.
On the other hand, metal alloys were used to bind weapons, and spices were used to prepare medicine, while the craftsman’s rope and wool were dyed.
The participants, who were very determined and active, tried to get involved.
"I think anyone can wear a costume, but the sense of being involved is art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are handmade.
I've been tying my belt for two years, and now I've been tying my dress, and only on her hands have I remembered 800 beads.
It matters to me," she said.
After earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of deaths increased to 832

The FBI contacted the second woman who accused candidate Kavanaugh
FTB agents investigating Bretto Kavanaugh’s case of the candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court approached the second woman accused of sexual assault, which was revealed by this woman’s lawyer on Sunday.
The report by Mr Ramirez, lawyer John Clune, states that the FTB's investigation of the Kavanaugh's case will not only include separate charges for trying to use them, which Dr. Christinea Blasey Ford presented this week at a dramatic Senate meeting to the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her his five in the evening, where she was drunk and who took part in a college in Jeile when both of them were studying there.
The U.S. president, Donald Short, submitted to pressure from the independent republicans of the Senate and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after a meeting of the Senate on Thursday, where Professor Ford of the University of California made extensive accusations that Kavanaugh had tried to exploit it in an evening that took place in 1982 when they both attended school and were teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House restricted the scope of the FTB investigation.
In short, he rejected and proclaimed the message of Twitter: "I really want them to question all the people they need from their own perspective."
The representative of the White House, Mr. Rajas Shahas, said that the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study should be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shah said.
United Kingdom will not withdraw environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom would not abandon environmental or animal protection standards in order to enable Brexito to enter into trading.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrived at Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservatories Conference, Gove said that the United Kingdom would benefit from being aware of its quality food products and the government will publish a food strategy this year.
Europe returned the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
On Sunday, Francesco Molinaris won the prize by returning the Ryder cup to Europe: Italy won Phila Mickelson at the 16th prize and earned a point to achieve the required 14.5 result.
Mickelson made his way to the dome when he launched the first ball in the water, and he was able to remain in the raceground Molinaris became the first European, I won all five cats a week, although none of the previous six had won.
The European victory has already been ensured that Italy launched a hit from the starting ground and the ground win was missing one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia led the match and was sure at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day they took the lead at 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from possible 12, so that they could get the trophy back and secure their stay at home from 1993 onwards.
Prior to this, the team only managed to eliminate the difference between four points and win the unit races: this was done by the United States team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012, but nobody expected another surprising return.
Justin Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony Finau gave the Jim Fury team hope to win the first cats, but then the European team points went up all over the field.
Thorbjornas Olesenas upset Jordan Spithe, and his teammate John Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles won four times.
Ian Poulter, the best player in the Ryder Cup, was well, most of the ovation this week, when the best player in the world Dustin Johnson landed him on the 18th floor and brought Europe to victory.
Then it had to wait, which the mother would finish first, and it was Molinar's game that caused a joyful wave in the mini, which was the biggest event in the history of the event.
RT World News: German policemen who protected Erdogan used the name neonacio as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, who protected Turkey's President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a notorious neo-Nationist extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the region said that the Saxony criminal police in eastern Germany are investigating two members of the SEC's elite anti-terrorism agency.
Men were destined to protect Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
Officials had to work secretly, so the protocol required them to use a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a notorious neo-Nazi belonging to a group of extremists of the National Socialists Foundation (NSU), who killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this age, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reports that a strange code name was discovered when two police officers requested permission to obtain the internal documents needed to carry out the task.
The officers in charge immediately withdrew the police officers.
The first to respond to the news was Peter Kleine, the head of the Saxon criminal police.
He said that the decision to use the name Boehnhardt was "perhaps the stupidest" and thus "evidently ignored victims and their loved ones".
Minister for the Interior of Saxony Roland Waller accepted this statement and called the decision "a faggot, fearless and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan’s visit to Berlin on Friday led to many contradictory assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for accepting the leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, "because they need to be dealt with in person when they are not in agreement".
The public first heard about the 2011 NSU when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his associate Uwe's Mundlos were found in a trailer burning in eastern Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed the other and then killed the bank in Eizenach after a failed attempt to rob the city of Eizenach.
A short time ago, the third member of the neo-Nation Group, the last surviving Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July this year, the German court sentenced her to a life sentence for 10 counts of murder.
She refused to commit suicide, but her lawyer claimed that the accused felt moral guilt because he did not try to stop the killings.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies were very critical.
Lawmakers, activists and victims believe that the group had many more companions.
It also showed that the German internal intelligence agency BfV has infiltrated many informants into the NSU and has been constantly hindering the investigation of murder related to the group, attempted murder and kidnapping.
Muskas withdraws from the post of Head of Tesla and will have to pay $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elona Muskas agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought him to trial for cheating on Twitter messages in which he claimed to make Tesla a private company.
Muska will have to resign, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement indicate that Muskas must be removed from the office of President of the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to this office for three years.
Besides, he's gonna have to pay $20 million.
It all started with a message from Twitter, which was through inadvertently or deliberately written misleading, so Muskas will have to get confirmation in advance of something by saying or announcing about Tesla "in any format, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company website), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because she has not verified Musko's original Twitter message.
In a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors on 7 August of having been informed by Twitter, in which he claimed to be able to make Tesla a private company, one of which would be worth $420 – therefore the company's securities cost more than 10 per cent.
Muska quickly withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public and upset the investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko's initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it did not find the facts".
Muskas himself explained in the blog that this error can be justified: after meeting with the representative of the Saudi independent asset fund, he was impressed that he was able to agree on the funds.
It is reported that Muska and the Securities and Exchange Commission have approached a more milder penalty – Muska should have refused the presidency's position for only two years and should not be admitted guilty, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell, and it is likely that this led to a change of opinion and more stringent conditions.
However, under the new agreement, as in the old one, Musku does not have to acknowledge the guilt of the error of the investors.
The Patriarch of Alexandria committed himself to supporting the canonical Church of Ukraine and called for Orthodox unity
Alexander II’s Patriarch Theodore II stated on the basis of a canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
He said in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Constantinople Patriarchate.
On Thursday II, Theodore arrived in the city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and met with the highest church officials and religious Orthodoxs.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchies, leaving only the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
"I have come to tell you: do not renounce the faith of Orthodox and canonical churches," said Patriarch Theodore II.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the Polish Orthodox Metropolis Savva, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian Church.
"We will always support those seeking orthodox unity," said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also called the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one Orthodox church from interfering with another.
Egzarchai are special Patriarchs who formally occupy a higher position than Metropolis Onufry, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate has reacted badly to the actions of Constantinople and has withdrawn all the church’s common prayers and membership in the organisations chaired or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is claimed that this decision warned Constantinople not to take any other negative action and did not consider that the two churches had completely discontinued their ties.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one Orthodox church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate of Ukraine is recognized by the other churches.
Most of the Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Patriarchate of Kiev, which emerged in the 10th decade.
This religious movement even has the Patriarch's published leader, Filaret, who seeks recognition of the official Orthodox Church, complete independence and equality with the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Damascus opened the main trade transition in Syria-Jordan for the first time in three years
According to the state news agency SANA, the Syrian government claimed that it was opening the Nasiba border crossing with Jordan, which had been closed for three years due to military action in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the land near the city of Dara.
Nasibas is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between the Gulf of Lebanon and Persia.
Key ideas from the UN Language of Lavrov
While visiting the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrova attacked the West on the "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy should not give rise to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the minister said that some Western countries, trying to maintain "the positions of the world's leaders themselves", were putting pressure on others without conscience.
He did not mention specific countries, but said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, a ten-year-old representative of the UN to Russia, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations changes the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without the UN's approval.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied to many countries were "illegal or ineffective" and recalled the US embargo imposed on Cuba for many years.
"But history has not taught us anything," said Lavrov, adding that "the Westerners are willing to impose the blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unjustified accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as the 1999 explosions in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 interference with Libya."
Of course, Lavrov mentioned not all Western invasions and recalled the seven-year Syrian war as one of the most recent.
The failed attempt by extremists to remove the Damascus regime could have been detrimental to the whole country and opened the way for the creation of a "terrorist caliph".
Lavrov welcomed the Astana peace process launched jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran and said that it helped to prevent the Islamic state (IS, previously referred to as ISIS) and other groups that wanted to take the whole of Syria.
Now, the most important thing is to rebuild the lost places of the country and help refugees return safely home.
Lavrova returned to the struggle of the great forces and said that the UN was actually set up "to learn from the Second World War".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that he had been a member of the "disgusting" Munich Treaty, which had been signed in 1938 by France and the United Kingdom, which had agreed to allow the nations to join the German-occupied part of the Czechoslovakian settlement in order to establish Hitler.
Although British Prime Minister Neville's Chamberlain said the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
"Munchen's betrayal" shows how far it can lead to "the selfishness of the countries and the violation of international law," Lavrov said.
"The dictatorship and violence of the colonial era must be helped in the history archive or trash bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have any questions or objections, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Krislas' eyes?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are suffocating the fog and Bibi's fingering to Iran
The President of Israel, in the language of the UN General Assembly, stated that Tehran has secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that the accused Israelites themselves are hiding something.
"Provide" Israel's favorite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed news on Thursday, showing photos from high photos of places where Iran is supposed to hold nuclear material.
Tehran responded without delay that Tel Avivas would be more likely to take care of his "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel never recognized (but refused) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdieus tried to find out whether Tel Avivas really should look for a spark in his eyes.
Government of Scotland: no complaints against Alexo Salmondo until January
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo were recorded until January of this year.
In January, the former Prime Minister was charged with two sexual harassments, although he strongly denied them.
He was notified of the investigation in March.
As a result of his resignation from the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Government will be dealing with the complaint against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaint had been recorded before January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “In January, the Scottish government received two complaints about Alexo Salmondo.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Previously, the Deputy Prime Minister did not receive any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the Prime Minister heard for the first time about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will firmly defend our position.
The Government of Scotland will seek as much information as possible during the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, for legal reasons we cannot comment any more on the case of Mr Salmon."
Alexo Salmondo said: “We will not comment because our petition against the permanent secretary is now being examined at a court hearing and we hope that a decision will soon be taken.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the complaint procedure against Alex by the Scottish Government is illegal."
"Dragons" score 29:13: "Warriers" played by Lee Jones Spurt
Glazgas returned the winner's title "Guinness Pro14" by winning additional points and winning "Dragons" Scottstone Stadium, and coach Dave Rennie's doesn't hide satisfaction, but he thinks the game could have been more precise.
After the unexpected defeat of the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's heavily changed teams asked to try and although she was able to collect the necessary points to remain at the top of the A conference, the wind and rain-damaged competitions.
"I think we've made a great defense tonight, played on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good," Rennie said.
"We need to play more precisely and we could use more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are happy to do so.
You should play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points today would not have been a good result.
We should have tried.
We won extra points of profit, but next week we have to make more effort to play home with Zebre, and next week with Saracens in Europe.
Although the air was windy, the Glazgo team began to earn points early, but TMO paid all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including his internal transfer to the left corner of Niko Matawal.
Disillusionment did not last long: the left column of Olis Kebble fell into the middle of the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily paid off.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwell Robson was fined, and security converted the other player immediately after 20 minutes of marking and the oxen earned the point.
The first part of the race was almost half an hour after reaching the target: the attackers of the Glazgo attacked the Dragons in a consistent manner, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry punished the bullies for 22 minutes on the side of the security guard Hastings.
The Warriors went to the mines, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because after a few hits the left side of Matawalu was unable to control the ball and was transferred to the left.
The second test took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings broke the Dragons line and wisely handed the ball over to Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position, and the result of the matches became 12:6.
The first minute of the second half of Glazgui was very successful: Alex Dunbar was beaten to death by Lee Jones and helped by Hastings.
However, the Warriors failed – just four minutes later they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragons Centre Adam Warren pushed it through the door, thus winning the points, and then Joshua Lewis took it after an open game with Robson.
The Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and the 54th minute after the fourth test earned additional points when Huwas Jones escaped to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (it was the third failure of the four tests).
Glazgas maintained a comfortable position and did the fifth test for a few minutes – Dunbar passed the ball after the caves with George Horne, and Hastings won the points.
Kebble's published by the best match player, but Rennie's got Hastings.
"They obviously stopped us from playing, but we just broke up in the middle," said the coach.
“He missed a few meters, but he was a skier and managed to get away anyway.
He's good shape and trusts himself."
"Air United" won the Morton 1:5 result: the five stars "Air" disturbed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two prizes, and Declan McDais added one more and thus helped Air to stay on top of the table.
Air went ahead after Shankland's intruder, intruded from six yards after Michael Rose's corner hit McDaid.
In the first 35 minutes of Morton's trial, Charlie's Telferer took the ball from Robbie Crawford's second floor and sent it down through Air to Ross Doohan, a miner.
The players from Grinoka's fourth half had a chance to get ahead when Doohan defeated Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser launched a weak fine that the painter had easily caught.
The second day of the 74th minute, Air crossed the race when the transfer of Craig McGuffie's long distance was dropped in the air and landed on the ground was sent to the doors of another replacement player, Craig Moore.
Moore passed the ball on to Shankland the same minute that broke into 17 this season.
On the way to the fans, Moore returned to his side a quarter from the edge of the court, and McDaids sent the ball to the door.
"Alloa" and "Falkirk" matches ended with 0:2: first victory of young people in league
"I'm happy, I feel relieved, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon after the very necessary first Falkirk win in league and the winning season points.
"Rangers" loaned attacker Zakas Rudden (18 years old) won after entering both towers and pushed the owner's team "Alloa Athletic" into the bottom of the championship and freed the club from the pressures.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
"We have probably earned more in the last three competitions, so it was great to earn three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It would be nothing, but it was important for us to win."
In the 26th minute, Rudden sent a ball to Patrick Brough and earned a break from the middle of the second floor of the gate line, when Diamond Petravičius slowed down the ball over the weller Neil Parry.
"We wanted to defend firmly, but failed," admitted Wasps leader Jims Goodwin.
A request from Hearts patients for half-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
The petition for the Hearts patients for the Betfred cup half-final schedule was signed by more than 11,000 people.
Sick people are upset about the decision to hold the two semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
The Scottish police advised that the SPFL decided last week to hold "Aberdeen"–“Rangers" at 12:00, and "Hearts–“Celtic – 19:45, thus provoking the anger of the Jambos” and “Don’s” ills.
The Evening News, together with the Aberdeen Evening Express, asked patients for a fair solution on Saturday.
The so-called "Super Saturday" decision was condemned by both Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements criticising the timetable.
On Thursday, a request was published on change.org requiring one of the competitions to move to another place or date.
The man is accused of two women in the village of Kent
Two women who were walking in the sixth and eighth days died in a place of crime.
According to the police, another man, also within the age of 70, is in hospital and is stable.
The 28-year-old who lives on the same street is arrested and will be sentenced on Monday for two murders and one shot to be killed at a court meeting of the Medveja magistrates, where he will be involved in a video link.
The police haven't mentioned the victims yet, but they think they know the suspect.
The neighbors said they were shocked by an event in a village that they said was "silent and friendly".
In 31st, Sophie Moorey-Brown said: "We have lived here for five years and have never heard of any bad events – always very quiet and pleasant to live in."
The Royal Archives and the music "Hamilton" will create a world of light about King George III
After the Queen presented the project, which opened a large archive of documents collected in the year of the reign of Jurgi III, she was confident that letters, newspapers and languages would help society to become better acquainted with the king.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided to cooperate with Westendo.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musician Hamilton Jurg III to review the most important documents from the time of the reign's propproprosene.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts available to a wider audience, so the audience will be able to obtain digital documents.
The members of the royal family have already publicly supported the music production, and the Duke of Sassex and the Duke of Hercogene will see the performance twice, although Prince Harry’s great-grandfather is constantly shown on the stage.
Michael Jibson, the king of the West, said that the documents made him think and helped him to get to know the king, whose image was made by the audience by the musician Hamilton, the film "Kingal Jurgi's insanity" and the series "Honey Story" for children.
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
US President Donald Short did not maintain enthusiasm after trying to reduce tension with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unu and said on Saturday at his sponsors' meeting that after writing letters he "in love" me.
Mr Short and Mr Kimas said that they would pursue the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula, which they discussed at the unprecedented meeting that took place this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed threats and attacks because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We kept talking," – Mr. Short said at the meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos arrived at the Greek cup semifinal
The Athens Panathinaikos in the fourth final of the Greek Cup celebrated the victory without any greater effort by Luke Lekavičius.

Lithuania spent 14 minutes in the field, earned 4 routes (2/2 div.), recovered one ball and performed one result transfer and broke twice.
As a result, Nick Calathes, who earned 15 points, competed alongside the Panathinaikos.
Squirrel cross for the Shimonyte: everything is decided by the party's "squirt"
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said that the Conservatives' internal elections lacked democracy, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Shimonyta as the candidate for presidents.
The celebration of "Democracy" itself was still strange, mildly saying when the party's churning, the head decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate had no chance of winning even theoretically," - S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government
"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, with this and we greet them," the prime minister added.
The "State Greens" delegate said that I. Šimonyta should be assessed by voters, recalling her work in the Government of Andria Kubilius.
S. Skvarnelli is not yet commenting on whether he will participate in the presidential elections himself.
The Lithuanian Union of States and Greens intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling "states" Ramūnas Karbauskis called the conservative elections "a failed experiment" for the activity of the few parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members, totaling only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing the money needed to be spent on those elections, it is clearly one thing that this has not been corrected," - Delfi.lt said to the news portal.
"I think that costs will not justify the result, because the result is nothing, the party has decided that their candidate will do so - it's all right, but for those who spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections, 79% of the Conservative party members and their supporters voted for the nomination of I. Šimonytės.
Lithuanian pay laughs Estonia: one area can change everything
According to a survey carried out this year by the Baltic Salary Survey of Remuneration Studies, the wage increased mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have left little behind from their neighbours, the company's press release.
"After surveying 850 companies and examining changes in remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that the monthly remuneration before taxes this year in Lithuania increased 81.8% of employees and on average increased 7.7% and the annual wage with the additions was 10.5%.
Latvia has little interest in us - a little more annual remuneration, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our state" - says the representative of the wage research firm Povilas Blusius and adds that with such wage growth trends, the overall economic indicators dictated by the country should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages grew as fast as possible
Although salaries in Latvia and Estonia were lower than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage increased by 71% of the company's employees surveyed and reached a little more than 11% in our country.
In Estonia, wages this year amounted to 73 per cent and an average increase of 13 per cent.
Remuneration trends also have a significant impact on change in workers, as shifting jobs can get a much higher pay than in the previous workplace.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and have not moved to housing, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage growth was 3.6 per cent, respectively.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries, not only as the average wage for new workers but also for long-term workers.
For those who do not change their jobs or their duties, the salary is as fast as possible: monthly - 6%, annual, including supplements - up to 9%.
According to the R & D expert, such trends often depend on, or go along with, the country's overall economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy prevailing in market trends.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic crisis encourage more careful and less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technologies, buildings, pharmaceuticals, can also generate common statistics and stimulate smaller changes.
The largest tax burden is on Latvians
In comparing wage growth, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the taxes, depending on the remuneration - even 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 per cent.
This is the case in Lithuania with a constant rate of 24%, so when wages are increased in Latvia, employees may expect to receive the same or even lower-sensitivity growth as in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a tax rate similar to that in Lithuania is 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
IT - the most competitive remuneration
According to the study, in all Baltic countries, almost independent of the level of duty, IT positions remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade is that the market indices in this area are one of the smallest and therefore employees earn less than the average market income.
Compared to last year, the most rapid wage has grown for engineering specialists in higher positions, as well as for risk management professionals.
Such wage growth did not overlap this year and some IT positions - a majority of the information security experts in organisations increased their monthly salaries to up to 14 per cent.
In the meantime, the wage for retail trade has remained almost unchanged.
However, some companies have successfully implemented wage system restructuring and have raised the annual premium salary by around 2 per cent.
According to remuneration experts, there is a trend that the growth of wages dictates the need for the most demanding specialists - in the Baltic States, the demand for system analysts continues to grow.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former promise doesn't stop crying
After divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson, caught up with her husband, pours out his pain by creating a bond of affection between them.
By participating in Saturday Night Live, he chose to laugh about how fast he attacks serious relationships.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that just three weeks ago Ariana and Pete withdrew their pledges, which took place just after a few months of knowledge.
Pete tried to create scenarios that mentioned his failed relationship, but it will happen on screen a little later.
It seems to me that the humourist of his former relationship is exasperating Ariana himself.
This kind of pouch hurts her, not to the heart.
At least that's how TMZ told the foreign news portal.
White or red: the dietologist recommends the choice of sugar
Baltic on objects?
Which sugar choice?
During the polls, it was found that although Lithuanians are still traditionally collecting white sugar, it is surprising that many nations are totally refusing to accept the ingredient produced by this white death.
The fact that sales of brown sugar are growing is also not hidden by trade networks.
According to the Maximus representative, red sugars are becoming more popular and the nations are buying it more and more, although the usual white sugars - according to choice is even earlier.
It also grows and organic sugar sales are growing in specialised organic product stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to Dietologist Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful effects on health can affect both.
"Red unrefined sugars are three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, these sugars have been multiplied, while their surpluses are harmful to the body," said Dr. Vaitkevičiūte.
In the case of non-sugar-free living, the dietitologist recommends that its daily levels be reduced gradually.
Doing so - the benefit of everything - will fall and will result in unwanted kilograms, improvement and health.
If you use sugar less consistently for a month, it will be easier to give up altogether.
"Every habit we form about a month's time, so when we do this experiment, let's say, a month's time when we take some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we'll see how positively this works and I think that we can all give up a little bit of effort," said the ideologist.
Doctors claim that white blood sugar is produced not without cause - abuse of sweets can become causes of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
Therefore, it would be worth trying to consume it as low as possible, so that this product is added to many foods, even to food.
Another Step "Lietkabel": Lipkevich lends to other LKL teams
The team of the Pannonian Lietkabeli said goodbye to Vytenia Lipkeviči - the attacker is loaned by the Prienų Skycop teams.
In this "Betsafe-LKL" season V.Lipkevičius placed 6,4 points, recovered 2,8 balls, performed 2 successful transfers and picked 8,5 points of utility.
FIBA Champions league 29 years 198 cm high athletic statistics reached 3,8 points, 2,5 recovered ball, 1,5 results transfer and 4,8 utility score in 21 minutes.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will publish a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevics joined the training staff
The Chief Coach of the team of the Pannāvėži Lietkabeli, Nenado Chanak, became an assistant to Lithuanians named Sandis Buskevicas.
Latvians played Vilnius "Lithuania in the morning" in 2005-2006, and in 2014-2017 worked in this club system as a male coach.
Last season, S. Buškevic trained the Jäkabpils Jekabpils team.
The sports director, Jonas Vainauskas, invited Stepon Babrauska to his post, but he is still planning to continue his career as a basketball player.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Yasikevičius, but it was not possible to reach agreement on both sides.
S.Buskevicas "Lietkabeli" coaches will work with Robert Kuncaiči and Algimantu Bružu.
Latvis will join Lietkabel on Tuesday and will be in the Cido arena through the FIBA Champions League with Dijon U.S.A., but we will not be able to develop on the ground since the registration has ended 24 hours before the start of the competition.
The reduction of biofuels prices will not be acceptable for all
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more leafy trees will be crossed in Lithuania in 2019, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kestučio Navicko, this is how you want to "impact" biofuel prices.
"We have a large collection of certain species.
We need to balance (...).
The concentration in soft leaves is because this is how we can have a little impact on biofuel prices," – Seim said on Tuesday, Mr. Navickas, presenting the situation of logging.
According to K. Navicko, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20%.
According to the Minister, next year, the number of peas will be cut as much as this year, and the number of eagles will be about 80 hectares less.
According to him, wood is cut out in Lithuania more because of favourable natural conditions.
"It shouldn't be next year," said Mr. Navicks.
Currently, 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fighting food prices - undoubtedly a duty: will encourage you to buy only in your area
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy, the proposed obligation for public authorities and organisations to buy 50% of food from local producers is published by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The Law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by local companies that won the competition," said Minister of Agriculture Virginia Sinkevičius.
The president of the meat processors association, Egidiius Mockevicius, does not doubt that this provision would discriminate against part of businessmen, and would also be difficult to control whether the law is not used by retailers.
The measure for inconsistency is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors.
Macrono calls on Europe to defend Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Tuesday to create a "real European army" which has the means to protect Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, calling for the establishment of a common European Union force since his entry into power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He recently gained a weight argument by announcing to US President Donald Short that Washington will withdraw from an important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Power.
"We must protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," - E. Macron told the radio "Europe 1.
This is the first interview given to his radio from the beginning of May 2017 at the position of the President of the Labour Force.
"What do I see as President Short announces that he is withdrawing from an important disarmament treaty created after the 9th decade of Europe's missile crisis, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis led to the development of a non-strategic nuclear arms development race, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in encouraging the United States and the Soviet Union to enter into an Intermediate Nuclear Power Agreement (INF) in 1987.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army," said E. Macronas, recorded on Monday evening in Verden in north-east France, to the President this week visiting World War I battle sites before the end of this conflict for 100 years.
According to E. Macrono, in this situation, 'when Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated that there may be a threat... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself, and not simply dependent on the United States.'
The French leader has become the main initiator by pushing the project to establish the forces of nine European countries capable of rapid joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
On Wednesday, the Defence Ministers of these nine countries will meet in Paris for the first time to discuss details of how this force will act.
The European Union has also been committed to significantly increasing its defence budget since 2021 and to research and technological development over seven years by around EUR 13 billion.
The current EU defence budget does not reach EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras of the French Military Schools preparing high-ranking soldiers said that E. Macron’s vision of a closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad, - he told the news agency AFP.
- There is, however, a huge gap between the European defence dreaming of Emmanuel Macron and the reality of the very big disagreements between the European partners."
Lukashenko threatened NATO with rockets: we are not idiots
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said on Tuesday that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to build forces at the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be afraid, by deploying bases in Poland or otherwise, Belarus will need more effective weapons, especially rockets," the state news agency BelTA quoted the words of Lukashenko, who met with a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own rocket manufacturing industry.
"In recent years - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have created our missile industry and produced our very precise (applicable) missile weapons," stressed the President.
Last week, Mr Lukashenko said that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and costly response to the plans to build a base in Poland and call it for the honour of President Donald Trump (Donaldo Tramp) of the United States "Trumpo Fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, this is worrying us.
If, let's say, in Poland they will say that they are willing to release millions of dollars in order to deploy some kind of short fort, of course, we are not idiots and of course we are responding to it," said Mr Lukeshenko, participating in the Munich Security Conference's main panel discussion in Minsk.
"It is understood that with our main ally (Russia) we are considering how to answer all of this and how to find an appropriate response at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow have been marked by Russia's 2014 Crimean annexation.
They also support Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's fight in Great Britain, according to the Russian special services, is believed to be an attempt to decompose a former double agent of the Sergei scriptic nerve paralysing substance.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further intensified in October, after D. Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could undermine the global security system.
A man who committed severe execution revealed how he killed his wife who raped a footballer
Brazil was devastated by a crime in which the country’s footballer, Daniel Correa Freitas, was severely executed.
The athlete was killed at the 18-year-old girl's birthday party.
A 24-year-old footballer found dead in the city of Parano, in southeastern Brazil.
He is reported to have been executed: cut genitalia, severe neck damage is also reported.
When Edison British Junior killed the footballer 38 years ago, he admitted his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas had abused his wife, Christian Brittes.
Later, when Brazil committed a horrendous murder, it was told in detail on television what had happened on a critical night.
"The evening had already reached a speed when I realized that for a long time I had not seen my Christian wife anywhere.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
After nothing was done, I broke down the door, and I saw Daniel and my wife lying in bed begging for help.
I've been dead mad.
Along with my former friends at the party, we pushed him out into the field and put him in the car.
Here I had a knife with which I fatally bribed my wife for rape.
I was very angry, and I couldn't do anything at the time," said the killer.
Along with his friends, he threw the dead body of the football player next to the river, where police officers were also looking for a tool for the crime of the main crime.
The Brazilian civilian police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and his holy daughter.
It is said that police officers investigating the incident are still hard proof that the woman was abducted during the evening.
True, recently distributed latest footballer messages and photos on the WahtsApp program can help run the research.
The footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through "WhatsApp" where he spent himself in the bed next to a sleeping woman who, as it turns out later, was the killer's wife Christiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different living rooms.
I'm going to eat the mother of the caterpillar, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the football player wrote to his friend.
This season, Danieli Correa Freitass, who belongs to the Sao Paulo Club, was second-rate in the capacity of a Brazilian league competing Sao Bento.
Tragically dead Paul Walker's daughter celebrates her 20th birthday: she didn't go down without tears
The tragic death of October Paul Walker's daughter, Meadow, will celebrate a special occasion - she's 20 years old enough.
The model Meadow Walker lost one of the most beloved people in the world five years ago and is still a quiet wall.
In social networks, a very rare girl left her teenage years with tears as she celebrated her birthday.
She mentioned him with a little peacock, on which the pink number "20" was great.

Austin Powers' fans left their head: another part of the film is waiting
The cult comedy "Ostinas Powers" has lured millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, humorous frames and costumes are still becoming an inspiration to many fans.
The film's creator and star Mike Myers announced that the fourth Austin Powers film is waiting.
However, one of the main actors embedded in the movie "Mini Me" will no longer be able to develop.
He was the actor Verne's Troyer died early this year, at the age of 49.
In October, it was confirmed that the actor himself had taken his own life.
Mike Myers believed that Verne's Austin Powers would be missing - a movie without it will not be the same.
Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not very special - he created all the popularity himself.
He was a great cascader, a great dancer and a great man," said Mike Myers.
Juliette Lewis will join the Konersa series, created by Rosana
The "Millions of Particles" and "Travel" star Juliette Lewis on the Twitter network confirmed that he joined the "Conners" series, created by "Rozana".
"Yes, that's true.
The secret is revealed! #JulietteLewissontheconners #TheConners" – this week an actor wrote on Twitter’s message and posted a photo where she holds a scenario with the name of the situation comedy.

That's great.
#JulietteLewissonTheConners", wrote Lewis.
In 1989, Lewis and Galeckis played "Christmas Holidays" for their brother and sister Audrey and Rusty Griswoldus.
According to Hollywood Reporter, Lewis will play Galecki's Blue girl, but I don't know how many show they'll show up.
Koners' debut is scheduled for October.
This spring's series was rated high and renewed for another season, but it was also revoked by its creator and star Roseanne Barr released in May because the Twitter network shared a racist joke about Obama's former administration officer.
The Koners will play a majority of the initial “Rozanos” teams, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman.

The series, in which Melissa Leo, Aria Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy's and Andrew Santino played, took place on the scene of the 8th-century Los Angeles live comedy.
“I am very grateful for the last three years. When asked about the show, I say, ‘It’s a difficult series about difficult people... but it has been a pleasure to create it.’ Thank you for watching,” wrote Angaran on Friday’s Twitter network.

It's great that the great Claire McCarthy will lead us all, and I can't wait to see how this great team will destroy this story."
Thanks to Hurts, it is no longer possible to take advantage of the suspension
After this Saturday, Jalen Hurts will no longer be able to be suspended for this season.
Hurts is included in the top ranking of the Crimson Tide Saturday match against the weaker Louisian team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
The CCAA this year has adapted the new rule – it is possible to suspend the player who participated in the four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts was planning to do this because of the controversial evaluations of the player and the team's staff's response to them.
Tua's Tagovailoa changed Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Sabana said he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama to compete for the national championship title against the Georgian team, but on the other hand he was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to the Crimson Tide victory at 26:23.
The former South East Conference attacker Hurts started the last 28 Arab cats and entered the season with a record result – 26:2.
In the Saturday competition, Hurts finished 22 out of 31 transmissions during the first four Crimson Tide episodes, ran 276 yards, earned four times points, and took over the ball once.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Dezas has to sign the contract immediately
Former Dallas Cowboys attacker Dezas Bryantas said he was returning to the NFL shortly.
A member of the famous museum, Terrell Owens, said that Bryant was worth the delay.
Responding to a question on Twitter when planning to sign a contract with the team, Bryanta announced on Friday a single word "Twitter" message: "Soon."
Three times selected at Pro Bowl matches, Bryanta is not a member of any team since, in mid-April, Dallas Cowboys gave up the fight for reward.
Bryanta, who may have refused a contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly linked to Cleveland Browns, said just before the season that he wanted to improve before signing a contract with the team.
In August, when Owens arrived at a professional American football museum, still talking about returning to NFL, TMZ told the site that Bryanta should try to return to the sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," said Owens to the website.
"All the viewers think that he no longer succeeds and he is no longer as good as he thinks he is.
He must now enter the team for any remuneration, accept a one-to-two-year contract – this is completely irrelevant – and show everyone what he can."
In 2017, Bryanta caught a ball 69 times, ran 838 yards and six times earned points.
The 29-year-old player has not missed 100 yards in his career – 23 races.
After signing a five-year value contract of $70 million in 2015, Bryantas did not escape 1000 yards in any season and did not score more than eight points of winning balls.
"If the Director-General or the owner thinks that your skills are deteriorating, you will not be able to secure or collect the desired amounts," said Owens.
He also warned that Bryanta had to get into the team as soon as possible because later it could generally fail and claimed that it would be possible to return to the Cowboys who were living in difficult times.
“Of course. I don’t know if their relationships are not damaged,” said Owens, who earned 38 times the points by playing three seasons in the Dallas team.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if cowboys take him back and he gets the chance, it will be useful for Dezu and Francis."
It is expected that CERN will establish a business development centre in Lithuania
Last week in Kaunas, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN), evaluated the possibilities of setting up a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where companies receive aid for commercialising CERN technologies, creating innovative products and adapting them to the needs of the public.
Although Lithuania became a member of the CERN only last year, the establishment of this organisation's business incubator in the country was delayed by then.
CERN representatives in Kaunas visited the University of Health of Lithuania (LSMU) and the University of Kaunas Technology (KTU) of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering Institutes in the valley of Santokos.
At the meeting of the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) guests together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Grandijos University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and Business discussed the ecosystem of Kaunas innovations and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a strong influence on regional science and business innovation.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN's knowledge and technology to key problems such as new technology and artificial intelligence would be used for disease diagnosis and treatment, for the processing of large data," says Dr. Leon Balasevicius, Director of Science and Innovation of KTU.
The CERN incubators, like other new business development centres, provide business development assistance - provide information and expert advice on technologies in product development and assist in searching for funding sources.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre included experts from various areas in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as medical specialists.
CERN is best known for the LHC, The Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
However, CERN studies are carried out not only in quantum mechanics but also in other areas, ranging from cryogenics (very cold temperatures for substances) to particulate monitoring and radiation tests.
The work carried out by these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of public importance: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus fire" has a new guide
The new Director General of AB "Vilniaus fire" appointed Roka Mituza, who will replace Raymond Pilka in these duties.

In the first quarter of this year, Vilnius fire ended with a loss of 315.500 euros.
Last year, the company earned 392,300 Euros during the relevant period.
The company's sales revenues without excise amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
"Vilnian Fire" employs more than 100 people.
STT detained R. Ača - Business knowledge
The former parliamentary and former director of the administration of the municipality of Raseini district Remigius Acha is suspected of harassment.
He's detained.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) shall report that the officials of the Šiauliai Board are carrying out a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in the municipality of the Raseini district.
"The former director of the administration of the municipality of Raseini district R. A. (Remigius Achaz - red.) is suspected of harassment.
The circumstances of the procurement of an untransparent public contract are examined, R. A., in the course of the duties of the director of the municipality, the possibility of an exceptional advantage for a private company to conclude a public procurement contract with a company managed by the municipality of the district of Raseini.
It is suspected that R.A. has accepted a high value (more than 250 MGL)" - the STT press release.
BNS adds that the company is "Rasian Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislav Šimait, the suspected leader of the company "Raseini Bus Park" in the municipality of Raseini.
This was confirmed by the STT representative Renata Ensjuggitė for the press.
The STT report stated that the suspicions were also expressed to two representatives of companies who directly papered Acha or participated in masking various financial transactions.
All suspects are detained, their workplaces and home-made cranes.
LSDD was suspended
After Remigius Achas was a director of the municipal administration of the district of Raseini, for a time, but he lost these duties after his report was rejected by the Council in April.
He was also the mayor of this region in 2011-2012. Mr. Aczas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the "Tvarka and Justice" party.
However, in 2013, he and this party split their paths and in 2016, in the Seimas elections, he failed to defend his own mandate.
P. Achas now relies on the separate social democrats and the newly created work party of the Lithuanian Social Democrats (LSDD) led by Gedimino Kirkil.
Shortly after this event, LSDD President Kirkil informed the press that Mr Acha had temporarily suspended his membership in the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed to Remigius Akui are an unpleasant surprise to us, but in all cases the law enforcement must take all necessary steps to make the truth clear.
R. Achas temporarily suspended his membership in the party until the pre-trial investigation takes place", says LSDD leader Kirkil.
In 2003, Achas was the head of the group of advisers of then-year President Roland Paxos, who later was removed from office, national security adviser.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R. Acho
Neither Mayor Algirdas Gricius of the Rasei district nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavalaiskas BNS said on Monday that they do not have any information regarding the specific purchase of the law enforcement investigation.
Meras Gricius reported that Mr. Acho's arrest had been reported on in the media.
"I can't really say that we were very excited by the functions, I worked as a maestro, he (R. Achaz - BNS) - the administrative work, and I couldn't say either for any reason or for whatever reasons public procurement this case was done," - BNS said maes Monday.
He also claimed that for the same reasons he would not wish to assess Mr Acho's former municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something that I could appreciate his work, because I did not directly control the work of his administration, as far as I was concerned about public procurement, competitions, said that such and such public procurements were taking place, such tenders, after what was seen in the public space, concluded contracts, which I already saw as a major.
That is why I cannot say how he managed the administration at the time when he was the director of the administration," said Mr Gracius.
He himself said that he did not interfere with public procurement and that he did not influence them.
Minister of Culture team - new advisor
Dr. Jozapas Blažiūnas was complemented by the team of advisers from the Minister of Culture, Lianas Ruokytės-Jonsson.
It advises on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that P. Blažūnas, a professor of literature and art archive of Lithuania from 2016 until now, was a professor at the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University of the University of Vienna.
In addition, in 2017 the students of the Faculty of Communication chose Mr Blažiūna as the best faculty teacher.
The new adviser to the Minister is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and the preservation of values.
No change
VZ recalls that in May this year, the team of the Minister of Culture Ruokytes-Jonsson, Dr. Viktor Bachmetjev, who advised the Minister on public information policy, was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renald Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the post of Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
At that time, Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson said that the new Deputy Minister she has chosen had the same area as Mr Augustinavičius.
At the present time, apart from Mr Blažiūnas, the Minister's advisory team consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Chief Counsellor Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: the non-acting GPAIS business is under threat of fines of EUR 90 million
The Vice-President of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Simon Gentvilas, said that the poorly functioning information system for Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
"As the end of the year approaches and the CAPIS system fails to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming more and more real.
Unofficially, it is stated that only 1% of the planned processing tasks have been issued of certificates approving the handling of packaging waste", says Mr Gentvilas in the press.
On 7 November, the Seimas launches an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on the Environment, which intends to discuss the situation, to explain why this programme does not function, why the programme module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without taking the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers are at risk and are again receiving huge environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," says Mr Gentvilas.
In his opinion, the shortcomings and inaction of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Job Concern
Some experts also warn that some companies may not be able to carry out the recycling tasks laid down by the State for the year 2018.
After the development of the first half-year recycling indicators by organisations, experts confirm the obvious reason for concern that some organisations may fail to manage the required quantities of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies may no longer be able to benefit from the emission tax advantage and would receive a pollution tax for a certain quantity of their packages that they have placed on the market each year.
The GOC wrote that two of the three currently active producer organisations had rejected such concerns and that none of the comments were submitted.
Kęstutis Pocius, CEO of the GV Green Point, said that at least formally whether or not the tasks will be managed depends on whether the problem of the information system for products, packaging and waste will be solved.
The Green Point plans that this year it will be possible to overcome all types of package management tasks, except for glass.
Although the Green Point task of the glass will fail to overcome this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the damage caused by it.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
In planning for the government to share food coupons for people with fewer needs and thus to promote family or farmers' trade, experts have doubts about the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
The head of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business Tax Commission Marius Dubnikovas says that the coupons have survived and the problem is not solved, and the Government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system seems quite strange and as if taken from older leaders.
If we want to help the public buy something or have more purchasing power, we need to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people have to decide for themselves whether to buy in one store or another," said Mr. Dubnikos.
According to him, the government, offering food coupons, would apply lower incomes to people who receive it.
"It seems to apply to the less-income people, as if on the floor with the help of a wax written on it, we, this government, gave you the wax, and be kind to us.
It sounds like certain anti-election promises, where they want to write their signature very clearly," said the analyst.
According to him, the food coupon system will require additional investments, and it will also increase the administrative burden, as it will require supervision of what and how it allows them to protect them from recycling.
The bank's leading economist Nerius Mačiulis says that with one tool to achieve both goals - to support low-income residents and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"If this is support for small businesses, German aid compensates for price differences and people can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, this compensates the price difference to the state from the budget.
This is then a support for business, but not a support for the population." - BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not have substantially changed the competitive position of small shops and would, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make the arrival of new market participants more difficult.
"It seems that this would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and that the people would also be quite uncomfortable, they should buy not in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but to look for several specialised shops with a smaller range," said the economist.
In other countries, coupons are used where the volume of goods or services is limited and should be granted to all equally, or to some social group.
Then the people receive coupons free of charge and can deliver them for food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by granting temporary tax benefits to businesses, by hiring long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, in the words of Mr Mačiuli, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the government is considering a new food coupon system that would help the poorest people to increase competition, encourage small traders or farmers.
The Prime Minister's adviser, Mr Malinauskas BNS, said on Monday that the idea is the most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20%-30% discount.
According to him, the number of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not abuse.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget for the programme has not yet been provided for, it could be financed from this source, perhaps from the European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently planned or not planned in the budget will be final, yet it changes in Seimas, so happens, may be transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, may be exchanged financing matters.
It is always a matter of priority to decide whether or not something is going to be done to find another additional source of income, and so on," said Mr Malinauskas on Tuesday.
So far, the scope and time of innovation has been determined.
