Valiant additional deputies are concerned about what they look like puppets.
Some deputies do not understand why their status as deputies should be changed to "Member of the Wells Parliament".
Deputies are angry at the plans to change the name of the local East under the name of Parliament Wells.
Deputies of all political views argue that it's some kind of mind.
One Labour Deputy said that his colleagues were concerned that it was repudiated by the words "stupid" and "neglect".
For readers outside Wales: In Walli, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "false".
The deputy said that her group was not quite satisfied and offered alternatives.
The Walli Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change of east name, but they noted that it was a short verbal transition from a Walli parliament member to a "marinet."
In this context, the Walli letter in is spoken in the same way as the Yorkshire English word u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now developing a draft law on the adoption of amendments to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the members of the East are called will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gives the Valais East the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that had broad support for calling the East Parliament Wells.
As far as the title of an additional deputy is concerned, the Commission has given preference to Members of Parliament, Wales or the CPU, but the CPU version has received the greatest support during public consultations.
The additional deputies obviously suggest alternative options, but the way to achieve consensus can be a major pain to the mayor, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to present a bill of change for several weeks.
The Reform Guidelines will include other changes to the Assembly's work, such as rules on the disparification of additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committees.
The additional deputies will vote in final terms on what they should be called when they do their lead work.
Macedonians vote on country name change referendum
On Sunday, voters vote for or against the name of their country in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The national vote was organised to resolve a multi-year issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they have long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour is a pretense to their territory, which has prevented the inclusion and friendship of Macedonia in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Georgie Ivanov, a referendum official on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of names is just the cost to be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The called St. Martin's Temple is closing, the churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
"Before, as the old people I spoke to were, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today is neither the present nor the second."
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and relationships at present," he said.
"The bar is no longer a cozy local hotel where people walk constantly."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale was not stopping for as long a period as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they were going back to where they had started.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by living women with candaminiums filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the district.
"The vast majority of the residents who buy candaminiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why it's going to be a fast day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that most people who go to these candaminiums will be present."
Both churches were built by a group of whites before Harlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870, the Church of St. Martin in 10 years.
The original White Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black man who had prayed nearby had the right to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was captivated by a black-skinned public under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who had appointed a bunch of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or press black-skinned.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but Father Johnson's trustees planned the reconstruction: they put into operation the corals.
The beloved David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and one successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called the coral "the poor people".
An expert who played Coralion in June called it “Cultural Treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool”.
An expert from the University of Michigan named Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first coral in the world to be played by a black-skined musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger coral in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriver said that in Saint Martin's Church he had not been replaced.
What has happened in Saint Martin's Church in the last few months has been a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been drawn by false church leaders, others by the Eparchy.
The House of Trustees – the governing body of the income of the chaplain’s assistants – wrote in the Epirus in July with a warning that the Epirus was “trying to translate expenses” into the House of Trustees, although the House did not participate in the hire of the architects and contractors sent by the Epirus.
Some of the guests complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Eparchy.
The shark infected a 13-year-old boy on a diving trip to California for the Lobsters.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster Hunting season.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning at Bacon-Bitch Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hemel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was dealing with his friends for half an hour, when he heard the boy yell at him, asking for help, and then swam with the others to help get him out of the water.
Hemmel at first thought it was just an excitement from catching Lobsters, but then he "understanded that something bad had happened: "I was bitten!
I've been bitten."
"All his key was broken," said Hemmel, adding that he noticed it when he went to the boy.
I called everyone to get out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" Hemmel added.
The boy was transported by air to a child's hospital at Raydy's in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that made the attack is unknown.
The rescuer of Captain Larry Giles stated on the media briefing that the shark had been observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe diversion.
Giles added that the suffering got trauma to the upper part of the crowd.
The officers closed their way to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essentis for 48 hours for research and security.
Jules noted that in this area more than 135 species of sharks live, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening sections with beauty goods in universities where trained specialists will work.
As a result of a significant push on the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings that continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion and household goods decreases, the larger beauty ladies will be presented in 11 saloons across the country and also in other new saloons next year, demonstrating success.
Investments in beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on the bars that used to be busy with televisions, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's said to double the volume of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweetman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear for the first time.
An existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in the company departments like those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
Many shops also relaunch their cosmetics shop, so most products will fit for veganos, and this trend is becoming increasingly needed among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and the second opens in Sally Owk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local shops around the house leads to what the supermarket has to do to make more effort to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, running director of Sainsbury's, said that trading points would be more and more like universities, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's dissidents, Lidl with the help of more services and non-stop goods.
Sainsbury's put Argos's trading points in hundreds of stores, and also placed several Habitats points from the time that two years ago acquired both networks that, he said, promoted the sale of food products and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and optics was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's protested joint ventures with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to divide the revenues from the optical shop ended after a series of break-ins in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its optical business together with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's optical network for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds had played its part in this regard, extending the range of luxurious brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our clients.
We also invested in teaching our employees who could offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any needs, and the attractive location and convenient location make us a better home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones had a good time after Holly Willowby turned down the deal for 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Dragons Den Peter Jones star was distracted after the TV show Holly Willowby turned down the deal at 11 million pounds of sterlings with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowby there is no time for branding goods for the house and accessories True.
The business pair became like the brand Guinette Peltraw Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now breaking up with her business of making brand clothes to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was distracted when the "golden" television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakinghamshire), that her new transactions of up to 1.5 million pounds of sterlings mean that she will no longer have enough time to deal with home goods and accessories of the brand True.
The business was similar to the brand Guinette Peltraw Goop and was raised twice to double the benefit of Willowby in 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced in Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones fled from Britain and headed into one of his homes for rest.
The source said: Truely was Holly's main priority.
It turned out to be her long-term future, which she would see after a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that this morning's leading care, which enters the number of the most significant British stars, can cost millions of companies because of huge investments in various goods -- from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as because of possible further delays in their performance.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to John and his wife, Taray Cape, for ten years.
Willowby founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the headquarters in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent share of Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will represent the M&S brand and replace Aunt McPartlyn as the leading ITV "I'm a celebrity".
Yesterday night, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his case."
A sincere conversation "after which we fell in love"
He gave up the criticism he received from the mass media for his comment, which he considered "unpresidency" because he was referring positively to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump refuse much?
Trump told his treacherous "dictator" voice.
"I don't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denoclearization talks came into focus.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea diplomat Lee Ann Ho told a world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not expected to "appropriate westerns" in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the field of intelligence.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we've got some good stuff."
He said that his efforts to improve his contacts with Kim led to positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers at home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"Being on the president's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands, and hundreds of people died.
For example, after the earthquake at W. Lambock to foreign NGOs, they said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lambok's population were displaced, no national disaster was reported, which is a necessary condition for international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they did not seek international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Even the Save the Children Foundation and it's gathering a team to travel to Paul until it's clear that foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Disaster Reduction, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in the Pala, to find out if it would be possible for the international agency to provide assistance.
Despite earthquakes, which always survive Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the unexpected nature.
Although in Château there were built shelters, in other coastal villages they were almost gone.
The obvious lack of wire to warn of the tsunamis in Paul led to a greater number of victims, though the warning was.
Even at the best of times, the movement between many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And the stressful disasters have complicated the pathology.
The hospital ship, which was located on the W. Lambok to treat the earthquake victim, is approaching Pala, but the path to the new place of distress will take at least three days.
President Yoko Oddo focused his pre-election campaign on improving broken infrastructure in Indonesia and spending money on highways and tunnels.
But the lack of funding follows the administration of Joke, as there will be a new election next year.
Mr. Joke also faces the pressure of a long interfaith tension in Indonesia, where Muslim majority representatives take more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Look: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool pushes the ball away against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's death in the Prime Minister's League, after which he reduced the number to 89 minutes on Saturday to London's Stemford Bridge.
The Starridge got a transmission from Jordan Shakiri when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea Gate, which was a 1-0 gate.
He made a fine ball left of himself before making a shot in the farstand.
The attempt ended by killing high under the top pole when the ball flew into the top right corner of the net.
The sword as a result flew over the head of the Hatter of Arissabolaga, which leaped directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get in this position to kick the ball, and players like Shak have always tried to jump as far as possible forward, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," said Starridge in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running Conte, made the belt easy, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
"Chelsie" was 1:0 at the beginning of the second team after the 25th minute the Belgian star Eden Azar killed.
By attacking the blues in this match, he then made Mateo Kovacic, before returning to the semi-defense zone and running halfway through the Liverpool field.
The coward quickly found himself in the center of the field.
Then he made an effective blow, handing the ball to Azar at the door.
Azar ran to the front and crossed into the lower left corner of the far stairwell past the guard of Liverpool, Ellisan Becker.
"Liverpool" competes with "Napali" at the group stage of the League of Champions in 3 hours on Wednesday at the stadium of San Paolo in Italian Nepal.
Chelsea meets Videoton at the UEFA Europe League in 3 hours in Thursday, London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of people killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, reported the Agency on Sunday morning to address the effects of severe disasters.
At the press conference, a representative of the Soup Purvo Nugroho agency said that according to the messages, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-ball earthquake that took place on Friday and called for waves up to seven meters high.
The city of Palau, where more than 380,000 people live, was surrounded by clouds of ruined buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old suspect in a murder after they shot a woman.
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found in Birkenheid this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with a no-brained wound in the Grayson-Muze district on John Street Street, and the 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police called for their people from this area who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'd like to address anyone who was around John Street in Birkenheda or saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, video recorders who may have taken off some video, to contact us because they can have information that is extremely important to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman, the body that was found, lived next to Birkenhede and was found in her own house.
Today the friends of the women came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police have said that they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muze just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to come in or out of the house.
He lost his tongue when he learned what had happened.
The lodger is now saying that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the whole area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were in the hexagonal perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating a multi-bedroom building.
All who have information must contact @MerPolCC Police Department, call number 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously number 0800 555 111, calling the record 247 from 30 September.
The parliamentary statue of Cromwell has become the last historic hit in the matter of "recording history".
His removal would be a poetic justice for his similar to the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
"But the Society of Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chief of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the present debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be the object of these actions.
The icons of English civil wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Tornichroft's vivid presentation of Cromwell is a testimony to the 19th century's idea and part of the story of action, which many consider to be to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than today as a protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was monarchy.
Or it's a very accurate idea, a subject of long-term historical debates.
There's no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual intelligence figure that represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievements as a protector-lord also deserve to be noted and respected."
A pig-killer took off to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media reported, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
"A man known only by the name of John was found dead with a broken artery and a blood clot, next to a lion on the market in Ljupánši in the province of Guičjev," South China Post reported on Sunday.
The winery was about to introduce the vaccine as a pig in a pighouse on May 30, 2005, in Sinina, China.
He, along with his cousin's brother, reportedly came from the nearby village of Junior on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the next pighouse was open.
He said that there was a great heap of blood in the pighouse.
According to the report, the forensics expert confirmed that a 550-pound knack had robbed a farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bent and damaged,” said a cousin named Wu (according to Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the surveillance chamber showed that John entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the news, the Yuan family and the market administration are talking about compensation for his death.
Even if pigs attack people, they're rare, but they were before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighed 650 pounds, pushed a whale farmer to his tractor and kept it till his wife had let the animal down.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act like a droppin.
'They're just dumb.
They're clever and very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of the "Roza" storm bring strong rains to the south west of the United States.
It is estimated that the "Roza" storm is weaker because it is moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will be taking a flood in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The speed of the Roses, a Hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles/hour at 5 o'clock in the morning, according to the Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was fixed at 385 miles south-west of Punta Euchenia in Mexico.
"Roza," as expected, moves north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the low-pressure area moving east to the western coast of the United States is beginning to form. On Monday, when the Rose is approaching the peninsula of Lower California as a tropical storm, it is beginning to push the deep tropical wet to the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, "Roza" will take some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches down.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the emerging low pressure area, in the next few days causes strong floods in the south-west.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation, it causes dangerous sudden floods, desert currents, and possible precipitation in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to the number of falls in places to reach 2-3 inches an hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, is expected to fall from 2 to 4 inches.
Because of the degrouped areas of tropical rain, there's a possible sudden flood if conditions are rapidly deteriorating.
It would be very undesirable to go out in the desert on foot because of the possibility of threatening tropical falls.
A strong rain may lead to the canyons turning into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by stormy winds and dust.
The emerging low-pressure area will take place with strong rains in part of the Southern California coast.
Possible summary falls more than half can lead to a small stream of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first drop in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains begin to approach the Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
A strong rain will spread in the four-point district on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperatures can be observed in the United States, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes in the near future.
There's a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Misura State), and Amhai (Nebraska State), St. Louis and De Moynam (Ayova State), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days the summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
It is expected that in many Central and Eastern States, a hot October with a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (80 °C) will begin, from South-East to North-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is going to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavana's hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting demonstrations of witnesses in the Supreme Court on the case between Brett Kawan and Christian Blacie Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political resistance continues, the publishers interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the news on Friday: a story prepared by the Arizona Senator Jeff Fleke for the FBI: it was a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure that the Dr. Kawan had taken her and tried to get her clothes off of her at dinner at the senior school.
Coffee in his hard testimony said that for 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen's company announced on Friday were looking at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's company usually has problems with people who watch television in offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing at the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavan, has managed all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
The interest remained high and after the hearings.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the chancellor of the deceased Republic published a statement that he would vote in Kavan's support, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when the protestors shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator for hearing in the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes peeled for a few minutes when he was licked, and it was broadcast directly on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have the authority, but many women have delivered her."
Flake said that his office had published the application, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and billboard networks for a few hours gave a direct broadcaster, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the question of the selection of the candidacy of the Coffee at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said that he would do it, just by understanding that the FBI would deal with the charges against the candidate next week, which the minority democrats call for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator-democratic Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, because it was clear that there would be no votes in the Republicans to confirm the coffee without investigation.
President Trump has been investigating charges against the F.B.R. Coffee.
British Prime Minister More blames criticism of "the political games" because of the British
During the interview, the Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of leaving the European Union that they were "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one of the interviews with her on the first floor of the newspaper was her foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "shocky" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal to have Britain and the EC had one fare was "very inappropriate".
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested LSU Dieteon Simpson's suspect in the death of a player.
The police arrested a suspect in the death penalty at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana University.
"The 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and put in a second-degree murder prison," Baton-Ruz reported.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
"Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had DNA from Simpson," said WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson's police said he had confessed to a deadly shot at Wade.
"The cost of the bet is set at $350,000," the Advocate said.
The next management of the Eastern Baton-Royal published on Friday a previous report saying that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Operational Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police are asking for assistance in the investigation area to support the arrest.
The Director of Sports at the University of Louisia, Joe Aliev, thanked the district law enforcement authority for "earnestness and pursuit of justice".
Six was only 20 years old.
As he grew up, he grew up six feet in Baton-Roz, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the team of the University of Louisia.
On average, last season he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 scores for the game.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at the University of Louisiana, Will Wade, said the team was "lost" and "shocked" from Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
Ash, which is evaporated by the Papacatepetl volcano, reached the southern regions of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Stable Disasters on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded for 24 hours.
In the center was a sensitive groove and felt a rush.
The images in the social networks showed that in the neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Sachimilka, there are thin layers of papal cover on the auto windshield.
Gephysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the capital after the 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
A meeting of the police with Catalan separatists on the previous year's independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence supporters met the police in public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration to mark the first year of a palatial vote in Catalonia.
A group of separatists in masks, which were held by police in public order, threw their eggs and blossomed with purple paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their dunes to hold the demonstrators.
For several hours, a group of independent combatants, who have been rocking "Don't forget, don't forgive", have been confronted by the present professional action, which shouted, "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries caused by protest actions.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was marked by the separatists.
The voters mostly gave the advantage of independence, although the voter's appearance was low, which was largely explained by the party voting.
According to data from the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The groups that advocate independence spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but protestors were forced to go the other way.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who was present on a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expected to gain independence from Catalonia.
"It took us a long time to survive one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the important but minor victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, which are speaking for independence, have tried to keep the momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile or in exile waiting for the referendum trial and the next declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean-Puch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"Be getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junckeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the CISA since the end of last year, announced that he would be taking part in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The election as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and reprisals that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Landers: Men arrested after they ran the house onto the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car had suddenly been cut into London's house.
The incident occurred in the Belinagard-Crescent district on Thursday around 19:30 a.m. in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gate and the building were damaged.
Maybe at some point in the car a bullet was released.
As a result of Manga's Lioningston hit, the Rangers won the 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Lioningston was to provide them with a victory
The success of Lioningston has been called Rangers, and it was designed to target Stephen Gerard after he suffered a few injuries in 18 games on the Ibrox club manager's crew.
The hit by Dolly Menge was great, because Harry Holta went up to one level with the "Hibernian" in the second division.
The Gerard team this season won't win the first round in the primary league, and the next week they meet with the leaders, the Harts team, who remain at eight points.
In addition, the Rangers in the League of Europe are taking up the "Rapid" in Vienna on Thursday.
"Livingston", meanwhile, continued his unprovoked series in a division of up to six games, and coach Holt still feels right after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
"Livingstan" misses the chance because of rough visitors
The Holta team had to warn long before they were killed, but such a direct call to Rangers caused a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke down, but lost his chance to kill himself at the gate, after which allan Litts could only direct his efforts wider to meet the impact of Craig Halkett.
The gentlemen were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the Rangers side was a fine shot, and Lioningston sent a debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson gathered together to overcome Mengo, who made a pass and killed him from the center of the field.
By this time, Rangers had dominated, but it was found that the protection of the command was unfavourable, and Liam Kelly's lock was practically not activated.
So it went on in the second half, though Alfredo Marelas really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pittman was photographed by the Rangers' locker Alan McGregor, and the Litts departed far from the second set of Lionston.
The swords came constantly to the gate of "Livingston" and were reflected, while the two requirements of the penalty, after halket was invoked for Glen Middleton's replacement, and the requirement of punishment for the game, were rejected.
"Fenome" from "Livingstan" is an analysis
BBC journalist Scotland Alexander Lamant on the Arena Tony Macaroni
Famous productivity and results for Lioningstan.
For men they were wonderful, continuing to surpass the expectations of this ascendant trajectory.
Their style of play and composition were practically unchanged from the moment they returned to the higher stage, but it was worth giving the proper Holt for how he had stimulated the team from the moment it arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great man, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Conar Goldsan and Joe Waral all over the field.
Rangers didn't get the inspiration.
No matter how good they weren't at Jared, they didn't meet that standard.
In the last match they didn't own the ball, only once they killed in the gates, which was some sort of alarming call for Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the list.
Herdgan's mixed attitude towards Kheln
On Saturday, 29 September, they saw smiles and feelings of baseless flight when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erragan's recent visit to Germany, aimed at renewing relations between NATO allies.
They fought about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdagon went to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish people live outside Turkey.
The police were looking for security so they wouldn't let a crowd of 25,000 gather in front of the ball, but a lot of supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Ergagan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politician of Ergagan and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect the disparity of the guest, whom some German Turks announced as a hero, and others condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: The rawler died in a car crash
Ravir died as a result of a car crash in London.
An accident took place near the crossing of the streets of Bestop Street and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deftford, in the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. in British time.
The driver stopped, the workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist died as a result of a meeting at Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The static police have said that their employees are working on identifying a person and informing him of his closest relatives.
Around that place there are road chorus and bus stops, and the driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Tower: Six employees injured in an accident
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in the prison of a strict regime for men," the Penitentiary said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Ustarchy at around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday, and they continue.
To fight the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, the Tarnada group was drawn.
At the scene, staff members were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "The specially trained prison personnel were directed to fight those who committed riots in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have been treated since they were traumatized.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we realized that the culprits would be transferred to the police and could spend more time behind bars."
The Royal Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison was being treated in the hospital after the arrest of the prisoner.
And in October of last year, police officers under public order were sent to prison to deal with serious riots during which police officers were attacked with waterpowder bullets.
The rose storm threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which may be useful for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's what can happen at the beginning of next week, because there's still a trace of the "Roza" hurricane in the south-west part of the desert that poses a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already published data on the sudden floods in West Arizona and in South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that on Tuesday, Rosa will go straight through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or pressure falls within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
"Katrina" (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona state."
The latest model of the National Centre for Hurricane Victims is projected to fall from 2 to 4 inches, with a level of 6 inches in the Arizona area.
In other parts of the southwest of the desert, including the number of Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with a separate result value of 4 inches.
For those who are outside of the risk of sudden flooding, the "Roza" hurricane could be long-awaited because their region suffers from drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be useful because in the south-west at present droughts are observed.
According to data from the American Dry Monitoring Agency, at least over 40 percent of Arizona's territory survives an emergency drought in the second category," weather.com reports.
First of all, the path of the "Roza" hurricane leads to the hills on the Mexican peninsula in Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour 385 miles south of Punta Euchenia in Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore it will be quiet.
So it's expected that in Mexico when a tropical storm comes, there will be a river coming out of the shores on Monday or evening.
Drops in different parts of Mexico can be strong enough to create a significant warming risk.
"The total number of falls is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to north-west Sanlara, where possible falls up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then the Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical rainstorm, which will then continue through the Arizona and the southern part of Utah until the evening of the Tuesday.
"The main danger is expected from "Rozia" or its remains, it is very strong rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," the National Centre for Hurricanes reported.
It's expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and desert currents and ups in the mountains.
An attack by Midsummer Norton: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in the Terrace of Excellence in Midsummer North about 4 hours a week.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20-year-olds, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Samersett," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"Caffeine asserts from the mood and anger of the Democratic Party," said Trump.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is the vote for the abolition of the inflexible and brutal tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump announced on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavano was "painting with anger and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his election to the post.
The coffee showed before the Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blaise Ford about what he had sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave an indication during the hearings of her indictment.
On Saturday, the President said that "on this day the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and brave character" of Kavano.
"The vote in support of Judge Kavano is the vote for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service," he said to a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president spoke directly about the Kavano election, discussing the importance of the Republicans in the period of the interim election.
"Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he replied.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for big candidates."
The Trump is not in agreement that the Democrats intend to "resist and hinder".
"The first key procedural vote on the Senate level is expected to take place no later than Friday," said CNN senior parliamentary assistant.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of people suffering is growing.
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the floods of giant waves on the beaches when a violent earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Slovenes," the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday, when the waves of six meters (18 feet) hit the shore in the dark, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake, a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake occurred with tsunamis.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and not immediately escaped, and they became victims," said a briefing in Jakarta, the president of the Indian Agency for Disaster Reduction Sotopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The tsunamis pulled the cars, the drums, the houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunamis passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) in front of the strike on the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the center of Paul's 24th.
Aerial photographs, published by the crash agency, showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges turned and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next race continued to climb the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in a region with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a powerful earthquake on Friday is about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hirasim in World War II.
According to his data, the city's geography, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
He called it "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and restaurants were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the clouds of broken buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 had been missing without news.
"The damage and damage can be greater along the shoreline in 300 km (190 km) north of Paul, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epidemic," Nugroha said.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," said Nogroh.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," says the Red Cross statement, adding that his employees and volunteers were directed to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency was widely exposed because they didn't report the tsunamis in Paul, but the officers said the waves were coming when the warning was given.
In amateur photos, published in social networks, you can hear a man on the top of a building screaming people out on the street warning about coming tsunamis.
In a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, dragging behind itself the buildings and the cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the removed material.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a serious power outage that disrupted communications around Paul, so it was difficult for the authorities to mention saving actions.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct the cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needs very much food and other items of the first need.
The airport of the city was opened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Yoko Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Paul.
As a result of the tsunamis in Indonesia, more than 800 people died
It's very bad.
"While the World Vision employees from Danggala were successfully on their way to the city of Paul, where the workers were hiding in the bridge caves located in the courtyards of their office, they saw the scenes of desertification on the road," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups have started dark operations at the start of disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers who have deep knowledge are prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to do so if the place of disaster is notified to the national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Pala, after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, friends and family who disappeared without news were hoping that their near wonder would be among those who would leave the uncomfortable congestive lines of austerity.
On Saturday the little boy was discharged from the sewerage.
On Sunday the rescuers released a woman who had been under ruin for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national paraplanning team, prepared two of the missing paraplans for Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandaghi, including the number and others who were trapped in Roa Roa's hotel, were his students.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanarism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told us that a few hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa Roa's hotel had spread among the community's planners, he had desperately sent messages to whatsApp to Paul's participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by one gray hook, not two blues.
"This means that messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they found Newport ATMs on the left.
"On Friday morning thieves robbed $26,750 to a worker in Brunka, who set up a bank account in Newport, Libya," reports Newport Police Department in Pre-Religion.
"The driver of the car went to the bank at a fun complex and was willing to deliver more money," wrote Denis McCarthy in the magazine.
While he was busy, another man "run away because of a Brink's employee" and stole my money for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not assign the number of participants to the incident.
Anyone who has information about them should contact Newport's police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Key West: Reper changes its name to Ye ("thy").
Reper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
Having announced a change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "I'm officially known as Kane West."
West, which was 41 years old, by the name of Ye, used this nickname as the name for its eighth album that came out in June.
Changes take place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to run his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande's singer for the show, which he resigned for "Emotional reasons," says the creator of the show.
In the light of the abbreviation of his current professional name West had previously said that this word had religious significance for him.
I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," said West early this year, considering the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So I'm -- it's you, I'm -- it's us, it's all us.
It came from "Kaney," which means "the only one," to "Ye," a reflection of our good, our bad, our loss, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who had changed his name.
Sean Combs was quite famous as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning to the names of Love and Brother Love.
There was a former Wester, Jay-Zie, and there was no connection and the capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopes Abrador, has never used military force against the civilian population, as the country is about 50 years old from the day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, at the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Square, Abrador "never use soldiers to please the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration on the plain, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while the left student movements were incarcerated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador has encouraged young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those who are learning, thus opening more free places in state universities.
"The unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
U.S.A. must double the funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount that they spend on research in this field," says an investor and machine expert named Kai-Fu Lee, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even if the U.S. doesn't have an official MY strategy.
In the meantime, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it seeks to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
"The allocation of the research budget in the field of ME would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next break in the field of ME," Lee said.
"Financing can double the probability of what we will achieve next major achievement in the United States," Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book The Superintendents of Machine Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houton Miflin Harkurt, is the lead executive director of the Sinovation Ventures company, which invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Melano he worked on a machine intelligence system that won the highest-ranking American Athel player, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google Department in China.
Lee recognized the previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robot competitions for a previous research project in the field of defence, and asked if it would be the next one to help identify the following monitors.
"A U.S. researcher often has to work a lot to get state grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's a corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired lightbulbs from universities to work on MI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should be offered automatically by the candidate in the MI field," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched a plan to develop the machine intelligence of the next generation.
"China's National Natural Sciences Fund provides funding to people in educational institutions, like the National Scientific Fund and other state organisations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a United States machine intelligence centre where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Engineering Committee.
And this month, the Agency's previous research project in the field of defence announced investments in the amount of $2 billion called AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it's currently investing in my research over $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. leadership, which tried to create a National Intelligence Commission, has not been monitoring the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote on the country name change referendum
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted on a referendum to change their name to "The Republic of North Macedonia", allowing them to resolve a ten-year conflict with Greece, which blocked applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the right of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory, and has put a veto on NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments entered into a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist activists argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the party questioned whether the voters would correspond to at least 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question of voting on the referendum is, "You are a member of NATO and the EC with the approval of the agreement with Greece."
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a cost that should be paid for admission to institutions such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgiewski, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will count the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires more than two thirds of the parliament.
The National Election Commission stated that no violations had occurred until 1 hour of the day.
However, the phenomenon accounted for only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said a 62-year-old voter in Skopje's capital, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritz and his son Duška voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will open the way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Stromica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the building of the parliament in Skopje, Uladimir Kvardark, 54 years old, set up a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents set up by those who would make a referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to connect with the heads raised, not through the service door," said the Cavadarcs.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that friendship in NATO would make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think that the majority will be 'for', because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," Zaeve said after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, it is said that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required level.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telecom showed 57 percent of respondents who are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were saying yes.
For a successful referendum, there must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the referendum becomes the first serious blow to the policy of the Transitional Government since its arrival in May last year.
Look: Sergei Aguera from Manchester City goes through all the defenses of Breitan.
On Saturday, Sergei Aguare and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of protecting Britain by winning Manchester City with number 2:0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute of Aguare did it with ease.
Argentinian attacker got then in the center of the field.
He competed between three British defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguara found herself among the four green shirts.
He passed by one defender and swallowed up a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed later on to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first hit in the criminal match of Aguara, who took advantage of his right stroke to pass the Braitana lock to Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some leg problems," said the journalist, mayor of the city of Pep Guardiól.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he killed the goal at the same time."
But that's what Serling gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of fighting in the Prime Minister's League.
This goal took place at 29 minutes.
Aguera got this ball in the depth of the British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a few advances before Sterling could reach the far end of the barn.
By attacking the Sky Blues, he directed the ball in the net before he jumped off the line.

Shercer wants to play the "selecting points" role against Rocky
After the Nationals had been excluded from the play-off competition, there was no special reason to start a new start.
But the ever-increasing competitive Chercer is hoping to take a hit on Sunday against "Calrada Rocky," but only if the consequences of the play-off for Rocky remain in the leaders after one game with "Los-Angeles Dodgers" in the North West.
The years have taken, at least, a unique place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to get their first title in the dividend.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least, we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will be so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but they are reportedly willing to give the Shercer a ball in such a situation.
The Sherzer, who was going to do his 34th start, had a KPZ session on Thursday and was going to be on Sunday for the usual rest.

Trump is speaking in West Virginia
The president spoke directly about the situation around his election of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, referring to the importance of the emergence of Republicans in the interim elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting for big candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to give back power to themselves, using whatever means are necessary, you see -- reality, measurement.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to him, the democrats intend to "resist and hinder".
'And you see it in the last four days,' he said, calling the democrats 'bad, false, contrary and false.'
He appealed to the Senate Judicial Committee for a prior recognition by the Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Fynstein, who received a loud assessment from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you want to reload the document?
Well, that.
No, I don't expect it to be a very bad nonverbal language. It's the worst language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer the main church.
This is the impatience of those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for me to be wounded, it was hardly surprising.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from a Liberian party who are said not to welcome us all to express their opinion.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship revealed to me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of the irony of fate, is similar to questions that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a message on the meeting, which was true on Friday of Nottingham's Eastern Liberian Party, it is said that "we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Liberian party, such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a 'better, more soft' policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It's getting more and more obvious that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is assessed from that point of view, it's a primitive for party leadership or not.
It began soon after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues with whom I had previously considered sharing similar political views began to expect me to take a step back, and took the positions I would not agree with -- in matters of national security or in one EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and that doesn't matter what I say -- there's a lot going on in social networks right now, in which they call for the cancellation of the elections, condemning central politics, saying that I'm no longer in the Liberian Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I was more fortunate than any of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racist prejudices every day, but they never get away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Liberian Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that takes a different view, and with every movement of "uncertainty" or a change in the party's selection rules, it's getting tougher.
For the last two years I've been given a lot of advice, which called me not to fall in the spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything would be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Liberia 32 years ago as a school student in the hands of the government of Tetcher, which has taught me how to teach in academically, I have tried to defend the best public services for those who need them most -- whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including the number of previous elections.
No one in the East Nottingham could ever get confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the present direction.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which is damaging to the homeowner, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
But actually the only message that I have, is not not nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, it's going to be members of the Liberians, or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the cancellation of the elections will be and the political will will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrows 38 - 17: Invincible Air on top
Two later attempts may have said a few final results, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting tennis championship match.
Now they have a tournament table, the only side of the ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chance that they had made their masters, Coach Peter Marty had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The robin Christie from Melrows said, "Give us the proper air, he's braver than we are."
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland's cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors, allowed Melrows to juggle numbers, and Jason Baggot caught up for an unrealized attempt.
The climate extended Eiro's leadership with the help of the penalty, before, directly at the stop, he killed, and then did a solo test, making 17-5 Eiro at the stop.
But Melrows well began the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, converted by the Richter, shortened the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruard Nott, which was stretched out, and after re-starting Air went further through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, realized by the Climate.
Air, performing Captain Blair Mcferson's duties, got a yellow card, and once again Melrows forced another man to pay with Bruce Colvin's unsuccessful attempt at the end of the February press.
However, the gentlemen came back, and when Mr. Stroan Hatkinson got a yellow card for what he had beaten the climate without a sword with a fine line, Makferson landed behind the air.
The climate carried out its attempt, which he did almost again after restarting, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the fine and sent his flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field's masters.
A silent game star, ready to take a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it found out that it was appointed the director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, is playing in a popular BBC show he writes, and he's photographed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems that Kernan is planning to proceed after Craigang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun's source stated that Kernan was hoping to participate in "the flourishing trade in Glass".
'Our Sea': Bolivia, which does not have an exit to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
The Maraki are patrolling the military-martial headquarters in La Pase.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In military-martial bases from the Titicaca River to the Amazon River, the Davids "Our Sea to the Right" is drawn.
Restoration is our duty.
In all Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the coastal line lost by Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, is still alive, as is the attempt to swim back into the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Balivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, she is waiting for a positive result," said Balivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many sailors will be watching the decision of the MS on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's declaration that Chile is obliged to give talks on Bolivia's sovereign sea exit after decades of tension.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a struggle for re-election in the coming year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that the court is not going to take a decision for Bolivia's sake, and it's a little bit of a change, even if he does.
AAN, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not determine the origin of possible speeches.
What the International Court of Justice's ruling is only going out six months after the final arguments have been considered, is to prove that the case "was not difficult," said a Chilean expert in the field of international law, Paz Zarate.
And far without pushing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have rejected her back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, the warrior knight Marales lost the rest of Chilean well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not been able to exchange letters.
Former President Edward Radríguez Velte, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will take the "exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "end-of-life of 139 years has broken out with each other," he said.
Kalsidilla also denied that Maralez, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, had used the maritime problem as a political resistance.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rey Yong Ho says that his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Rye spoke at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called upon the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Attorney of State Mike Pompey, similar to being on the verge of renewing a nuclear topical diplomat with North-Korean Kim Chen and more than three months after Singapore.
Rey says it's a "necessary dream" to make long-term sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with a declaration if Phenyan doesn't start a major disengagement at first.
And Kim, and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, need a second summit.
But there's a great skepticism over the fact that Phenyan is serious about the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
On Paris' fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive main clothing on the way to the shop in your cities
If you want to zoom in on your hat collection or close the sun altogether, you can no longer search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extraordinary headgears for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
In the summer of Instagram, the designers of non-practice hats, who sent their faces to the stage, won the popularity of the band.
The remarkable figure of Valentino was a luxurious coastal hat, decorated with wide fields, similar to the feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other handcuffs of an unusually large size included precious coffee stones, the witch hat and even pineapple, but they were not meant to keep their head warm.
However, Brown also showed a collection of wise-hearted masks, just as he did to Halloween.
Many of the diverse masks were with their mouth shut and more remembered by the Ganibal Lecter than by the high fashion.
One of them recalled a sailboat with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was similar to a frozen cone.
And if you continue to stick to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who look after style predict that huge hats can happen in our everyday life.
The large size hats go five to La Bomba, a Solomonian hat with a two-foot field that you can see in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratikovski.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was loosely torn in social networks, contributed to yet another large design on the thought – a Solomonian beach bag, almost as large as a model with this bag, dressed as a buyer.
The black-and-white bag with a shelf, decorated with a raffia accountant and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the collection of Jacques La Riviera SS19 on Weekend fashion in Paris.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets the following summer, as the designer had great influence, and it would be difficult to ignore the attempts of non-profit accessories."
John Edward: Language teaching is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have achieved academic success, which has continued since 2018 with yet another excellent outcome of the exams that are underpinned by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community starters.
More than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, schools presented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further higher education, chosen by their careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and establish an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it stays in his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't only trust in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the latest exams this year, we see that languages take the first place in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher grade A in Chinese, while 72 percent of students who studied German, 69 percent who were French, and 63 percent who were Spanish, also reached level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages such as vital skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Language as an object is now selected in the same way as that of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
The survey conducted by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that among the reasons why employers had difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent had to do with language skills.
So more and more language skills become needed to prepare young people for a future career.
With more promising jobs that need language, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter who chooses a profession when you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for your whole life.
It's possible to contact people from other countries automatically to put a multilingual person first among competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent did not speak well enough in a foreign language to speak, and the French was the only language in which a two-digit percentage was 15 percent.
That's why investment in learning languages is now important for modern children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be distinguished by the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will be able to speak languages that are considered most important to Britain in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in, in independent schools, there's always going to be a choice from several languages with a teaching component, which is a specialist in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to provide an environment of learning that will equip children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At present, we cannot deny that in the global business environment languages still have a vital value for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be regarded as "the skills of international relations".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and advantage for young people in Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Sunday in San Diego
Start waiting for supporters who want to see Lebron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers told Luke Walton that James was playing at the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes does he play, you still have to determine.
"It'll be more than one and less 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably be playing in a limited time.
According to the practice of this week. James was asked about his plans for six pre-season graphics.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Thramp Talk Time, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching many of the company's actions.
It was the first of the five planned talks of Trump the following week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming the vote on the election's arrival to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support for the interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are given in November.
When does Trump's speech begin this evening in West Virginia and how do you view it on the Internet?
The Trump performance in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET tone, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trump performance in West Virginia on the Internet below in the direct atmosphere on YouTube.
Trump, rather than anything else, this week will consider hearings at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, which has problems with the opportunity for prosecutions in sexual disputes with pending confirmation in the Senate of the vote for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans who are ahead of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's company announced that these five speakers next week were directed to "activise the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to the highest possible number of states, as we enter the tense pre-election season," said Reuters representative of Trump.
In the Wesbanco Arena arena in Willing, today's action can attract fans from Agao and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pitchburg media," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate in the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in matters.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a boost in questioning," said Simon Heather, a politician at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder's 2018 Cup: U.S. Command is moving to fight to preserve hope of life on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions on the four of Saturdays, perhaps, they were exactly what it took for this Rider Cube.
The goal of the momentum that is coming is to create a completely inventive sport concept in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say impulses now?
"They had a advantage with six points, and now they're four, so I think we're going through this with a little impulse," said Jordan Sleepy, walking for the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points ahead, and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spitts say, feel that in their ease the wind lifted up, and they have what they expect, not in the least, because of the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spyte was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These garnished cheers of celebration became increasingly louder at least as long as there was one round, and he struck a decisive blow to play in the match on the four fields when they and Thomas joined two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win in the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, like that which tells you that he thinks the American team is not off.
"You just need to get deeper and worry about your own sword," said Spita.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have got more points than Spyte and Thomas are French Minors and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Cube Ryder.
Strange but magical couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Mallywood" were the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday, on the second half of the day, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday and on the second half of Friday.
It happens, and like their energy, it flows to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Flitwood or Malinarians.
Wanted both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European fame remains temporary.
Bobbie Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the early fursket when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
The Boggies and the two twins on the previous nine drew out the Spanish and the Swedish to him, with which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the match of four swords and fours it's so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between the couple's composition, the advice they give, the advice they don't perform, and the way the strategy can turn into a single moment.
Europe has thus far become the best team and has played a significant role in the last day, but this fourth session also shows that the US team is trying to fight, which some have doubted, especially in the States.
Europe is going to the 10-6 Cuban Rider Final
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Cuba Rider after coming out of the four matches on Saturday and four with the 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and French painters set the battle against two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results of Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Burne, trying to preserve the trophies that they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, took over in the American agency of discontent in the morning, getting a series of 3-1.
The U.S. offered to fight more in the match of four matches, winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
In order to preserve the trophy, Jim Furic's side needs eight points out of 12 single matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and the Malinarians, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational outputs, are the only two couples who won four points for their first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
By smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they were miraculously anchored to defeat the fallen Woods and American sailor Brisan Decomb, another 5 and 4.
Woods, who carried himself through two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of lightning, but now he lost 19 of 29 times in four matches and four and seven locks.
Justin Rose, resting on an x-game of four matches, returned to his partner Henry Stanson in the match of four matches to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki -- taking one and the other place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day in the south from west to Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time top winner of Jordan Spright and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in the match of four matches and returned later to win Puller and Rory McCillro 4 and 3 in the four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cuba's Ryder team came back with a four-point deficit, which goes alone, although on the side of Furic's owners it's only necessary to draw to preserve the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were the best, the contract on Sunday looked like they could do everything.
North Korea says "no way" will not be disarmed in one way or another without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said that on Saturday, the United Nations continues sanctions that strengthen confidence in the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot renounce nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner.
R. Y. Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Authority that last year North Korea adopted "significant measures of good will," such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing zones and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“At one time we don’t see the right answer from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence the United States will not be confident in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way of disarming itself in the first place."
In spite of Ri's publication of the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "paediatric" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded, as it took steps, his statement proved significant in that he did not reject the one-sided denuclearization announcement made by the Phenyan in the past.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Chen Yn and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the United States President himself and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the road to the "denoclearization of the Korean peninsula", with this Trump promised to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is officially trying to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Beijing must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to cancel severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on "denomination" and increasing pressure levels by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, and even speaking against "war-end notifications," says Ri.
"Recognising that sanctions can put us on our knees, is a meaningless dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the length of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri didn't mention plans at the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Chief of Staff noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Mun Jain over the past five months and added, "If the issue of denoclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denoclearization of the Korean peninsula would not become such a topic."
However, Ri's tone of speech was sharply different from last year when he spoke to the AAN General Assembly stated that the goal of the U.S. contingent with the help of North Korea's missiles was inevitable after what "Mr. President Zla" Trump called Kim's "missile."
This year in AAN Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but said that much more would be required, and sanctions should remain in force until the North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are fighting in AAN, and the Security Council has said that it is worth paying for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompey, told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be actively and necessarily continued until we are sure of complete, final and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council strengthened sanctions in relation to North Korea in 2006 to try to stop financing the Phenyan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri in the colors of the Security Council. The General Assembly then announced that in the following month he would visit the Phenyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he left Phenyan, saying that the progress made with North Korea over several hours of talks had ended with a statement by the visa that he presented the demands "like the gangsters".
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
Trump said that Kim's "appropriate measures," which he was waiting for, was a guarantee of security and a attempt to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking the right rest.
The new Harvard University course this year should teach students more sleep, and it's my goal to fight with culture to learn from coffee at night.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chester, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical specialist at a hospital called Brigham and a woman's hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first of his kind in the United States.
Inspired by the effect of a lack of sleep on learning, he began his course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did they just tell me this now, at the last lesson?"
"She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep--it surprised me," he said.
For the first time this year, the course taught by the student explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sporting achievement and also improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to take a course after finding that students were often out of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there are images of rooms on the Internet, where students click on cups of coffee, aprons and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports indicators, as well as the importance of the habit before sleep.
At an appropriate stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The compass map, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their everyday lives.
"We know it doesn't immediately change students' behavior.
But we think they have to know it as well as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the culture of night candles still exists, adding that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation, which is becoming more and more problematic.
"An adequate sleep of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, depression and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid the weight of the bush, because sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired everyone to learn on the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the graduates to complete a similar program of pre-graduate education.
Professor Chesler recommended that the student set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up to the harmful effects of blue light, which comes from the screens of monitors and LEDs, which can change the day-to-day mode, which leads to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Randers": Menga kills Gerard's target.
The Rangers suffered one more time when the goal of Dolly Mengi was to make sure that Steven Gerard didn't get one or two times at the Lioningston Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on his way to the 4-1 triumph in St. John's, but the team of Harry Holton is already wearing the second defeat of Gerard as manager of 18 games to leave behind eight points, leaving the leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts prime minister.
Manga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, inspired by the noise, didn't seem to have to suffer suddenly.
At the same time that the Rangers are down to sixth place, the Lioningston is up to third place, while the Hibernians are left with a difference in balls.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after how the foreword of Colum Spence should be treated from a head trauma after his trapping the object thrown out of the tribunal.
Gerard made eight changes of players, so Ira didn't play half-final Cuba Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levy under the 11th room, which allowed to pick up a point from the Hearts last week, and was delighted by how well they had walked each step of their opponents.
The Rangers were better able to hold the ball, but Ligston made more attempts to kill the ball.
They must have been killed in two minutes already, when Mengy first directed the ball through Scott Pittman to the door of Alan McGregor, and then the prisoner took this chance.
James Caegan's successful fine-fighting surprised Craig Halkett, but his partner for the defense of Allan Litts was able to carry a strong blow back.
Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was more likely to kill than they were showing a good game.
Alfred Marelles must certainly have been punished by a fine for four hours before the end when he and Stephen Loveles met in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but there were Ibrox Liam Kellys who almost gave Lassana Kulibali's goal and effective attack on this Eheriya.
Although killing the first goal at the 34th minute of Livi may have been against a further active game, no one denies that they have to show up a good game.
The Rangers couldn't break through Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher followed Scott Robinson, who blocked Mango to get the chance to kill at the gate.
Gerard switched to the Kulibali break on Ryan Kent, and it showed an effective effect when the attack came upon Marallas, but the startling Kelly ran and blocked the strike.
But "Livingston" continued to satisfy visitors by playing this game, which was what they liked, and Litho and Halket continued to play the ball after a long struggle.
Beach Holt was able to prevail only in the last few minutes, but McGregor was playing well to resist Jacobs before how Litgau set out on a spare bed.
The replacement of Rangers with Glenn Middleton occurred in a row after the penalty when he confronted Jacobs, but Thomasan managed to get away.
Almanac: Geiger's inventor.
The page from our Almanac Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... the day of the future physicist Iagan Wilhelm "Hans" Heiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that resulted in the emergence of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950's film called "Coronad," in which those who participated seemed to be little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
And if you put in the headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give away the radiation in the minerals."
Evans said, "Tell me, is this really disturbing right now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help your immune system to see and destroy bad cells.
The vaccine, however, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method predicts getting the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then you can see cells that are spread out into many cancer cells, and then you can re-enter the cells.
The test vaccine has a successful outcome for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was given an vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells found that ovarian cancer is disappearing for 18 months.
The method includes getting the patient's immune cells, changing them to the lab, so they can see the HER2 protein, which is common to many cancer cells, and then being re-introduced.
Professor Jay Burzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betese, Maryland, and our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that are struggling with cancer of small bees, eggs, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofski.
A similar approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and their "learning" to reach cancer cells has worked well in the treatment of leukosis.
The West Horse began a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after his appearance in SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In a studio during the evening of the Khaine West evening, he was despised after a speech that he was bluffing at the United States. President Donald Trump said he was going to fight for the second term of 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "The City of Paradise," when he was in the headline "Make America a Big Again," he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star was influenced by Brett Cavano's demonstrations before the Senate's judicial committee when it came to the issue of the sexual violence of Christine Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of West Papali were taken into the frame and were loaded into social media comics by Chris Rock.
I didn't understand if the year was trying to get out of West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They thanked me for the scenes.
They said, “Do not go out with this prick.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in the mood," he said, as the Washington Examiner reports.
West continued: "Do you want to see where he is?" "Speaking that he" put on my Sperman hat, which meant he can't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least twice the hearings were taken off, and the SNS representatives were confused with Veraiti's message, "The whole study is closed."
The West was taken as replacement for the singer of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West was surprised by the many performing of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water perrier.
West received support from the conservative TPUSA leader, Kendez Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But leading a stream-show Karen Hunter wrote that West was just who he was, and it was always wonderful.
"But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his "arts", which I consider, embraces and distorts the ideology that harms my spouse.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially called Kane West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went after Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg's rapper was named after Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, previously known as the primordial.
Trying to kill a Belfast restaurant
The 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after the restroom in the eastern part of Belfast attacked the second man on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balichacomor, as the police report.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday at Belfast's trial.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Golden Throne star Kitt Harrington caught idealized brutality.
Kitt Harrington is known for his waving sword and John Snow's role in the "Golden Tablets" series in the middle of the HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got the stereotype of a hero's macho, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking in the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he thought that something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married her neighbor to Rose Leslie's Golden Throne, who is also 31 years old, has come to realize that it has the power to solve this problem.
"I feel myself a strong boy, when we've made a mistake with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view that we see now?"
The whale thinks that television must be responsible for the occurrence of brutality because of very male characters.
He continued: "What is at first, and why do you learn this?
Why teach on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real man?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview he also admitted that the next summer the series would end, and he will come out of the battlefield of the series and will not do any trouble or cyclones to the "Golden Thrones."
From November, Keith will begin to rebirth the True Western Sam Shepard, who is the historic director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, an actor announced that he considered meeting with Rose's wife to be the best chance to finish the Thrones Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family and my life here," he said.
The Rose played the Ygritte, a character in which Kita John Snow, a hero in this fantasy series named "Emi" was loved.
The couple were charged in June 2018 at Leslie's headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases by 14%
China reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to health workers, over 820,000 people were infected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusion.
"The same number of people infected with HIV infection through blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero," said Chinese officials at a conference in the U.S. government.
Yet, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is China's acute LGBT strain problem.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people has been so far.
Because of the conservative value of the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread out with insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been making universal access to HIV drugs through efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the anger of the rain, the danger and the theory of terms by her fellow parliamentarians
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters filed a charge on Saturday that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that there are pretensions to the members of the upper wing and their sites.
"A lie, a lie, and a very disgusting lie," says Waters on Twitter.
Public information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Senses. Lindsey Grem from South Queen and Mike Lee and Orin Hetch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the hearings of the Senate commission on sexual charges in relation to a member of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavano.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and provided information to the Waters team's staff," said Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my team whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges, in no way was responsible for the leak of this information.
It's an unsubstantiated claim completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' application quickly called for criticism on the Internet, including the number of former White House Prescretor Ari Flasher.
"It's a denial of anger," Flescher wrote.
It's evidence that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone accuses them of not doing it, they shouldn't get angry.
They must not behave abusively.
They must not question the grounds for their accusation.
They must be calm and kind.
The Flasher compared the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the democrats to Judge Cavano, when they were accused of being too busy during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Naara, a candidate for the Republican Party, who fights and participates in meetings in the interim elections, also said on Twitter.
"It's a resonance, if it turns out true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they bear legal responsibility for all their actions which are instructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again hits a man named Rowen Atkinsan.
It has now become a tradition to search for the meaning of BREXITUS in any new film with a British derogation, and this angle seems to be in the comedy and French-speaking Johnny English, which began in 2003 with John English and continued in 2011 called "Johnny England's Addiction".
Can the satire express itself well against how obvious is it that we look foolish when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was louder than any comic book he had made for non-English viewers in cinema.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his wisdomful pretensions on the glamour, got a bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bin's features and a little bit like that of a guy who took a single note to the Horn of Fire on the occasion of the opening of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally his character was based on the hunters and international secrets of Atkinsan, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There's a couple of nice moments that weren't before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the day's success, and the grooves of the rotor were biting on his helmet.
Don Atkinsan's gift for theatrical comedy is clearly demonstrated, but the humour feels weak, and therefore it's strange when serious movies, such as Agent 007: Mission non-executive, are definitely offering comedy as a major part of it.
The humour feels not only for adults but also for children, and even the stupid accidents of Johnny English are not as inventive as the silent films of Atkinsan in the character of Bin.
The most important problem of Britain is that it's a multi-year-old think tank.
Cyber-hacker leaks into a super-secret British spy community in Britain, revealing the names of all British agents on the scene, to the disappointment of the state agent, which is unfortunately Kevin Elden's small role.
This is the last dot for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this quazi-Terezay-May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every real spy will be discovered, she will have to activate one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, it's all complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in a number of fancy institutions and he teaches how to be an undiscovered operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Music a lesson in espionage.
The English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and agreed with his former multi-year-old friend Bo, who was playing Ben Miller again.
Presently, because my marriage is tied to the commander of the submarine, whose role the Vicky Pepperdin played was a bit empty.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they're working again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurilenka.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister gets a dangerous warrant from a charismatic technical billionaire who says he can solve the problems with the hackers of the United Kingdom: with the famous Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Bow start their equinoxes with immediate things: masked under the officer, burned down the French restaurant; created a conspiracy, fought with smugglers on board the luxury yacht Volta; English makes a clean anarchy, because it tries to use the virtual reality jewelry to familiarize itself with the entertainment of Walt's house.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, with quite a lot of children on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how with other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Liberian Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay British people a four-hour working week with a pay rate of five days.
Jeremy Corbin's work party must consider a radical plan when the British only work four days a week, but they pay for five.
It's reported that the party wants business managers to report the work results of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an additional day off.
It was obvious that employees would enjoy the three-day outings, but they would still get the same salary.
The source indicates that the idea is in line with the party's economics and that it plans to direct the country to the support of the workers.
The trade union has approved a four-week transition as a good way to make use of a change in the economy.
An older source in the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but a four-hour working week is an idea that matches the party's view and a general business strategy to regulate the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian Party is not the first to approve of this idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-hour working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the efforts of the Liberian party at all are not supported.
A representative of the Liberian Party said: "The four-hour working week is not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Chancellor John McDonald used a working conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he decided to return the authority from the "safety directors" and "managers" to the community.
A shadow Chancellor's plans also provide that the current water-supply shareholder may not get the whole package of shares back, because the government of Liberia can make a "account" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to take the company's advice and create a joint property fund to transfer 10 percent of his own funds to a private company that would keep annual dividends up to 500 pounds of sterlings.
Lindsey Grem, John Kennedy's release for "60 minutes," which follows the FBI that works with Cavano, has to change his mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano has been postponed to a final vote on his election to the Supreme Court for at least a week.
In an interview with Epherus on Sunday '60s', Scott Pelly asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Greham about "Sense," whether the FBI could reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the Queen of the South.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going to the courthouse: I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after that, and I asked him why he was accused, and I said, "You did it?"
He was determined and unique."
The Grem's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Cavano decided that it would be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects it," added Grem, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
'And everyone she calls couldn't believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the International Festival is held: an annual musical event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and my mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Civil Society Festival will take place at the big hub of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez, as well as learn about the real purpose of marriage – to stop poverty and struggle by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil Society Festival is a continuation of the Global Project against the Hedgehog of an international propaganda group, which hopes to end poverty at the expense of increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "take action", be a volunteer, write by e-mail to the country's leader, call any other actors and raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civilian Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its purpose?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called "callism" -- people feel that they're doing a good job by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers have reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to motivate influential leaders to carry out their responsibilities for more than $37 billion, which can affect lives more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on obligations and reported at least $10 billion, which had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the resources provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the UK, "helping children to develop in full," a promise to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help avoid malnutrition in the country after obtaining more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate social injustice in the history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group announced that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out, which were called on in Britain to improve food for molecules and children, the government announced funding for the food aid project to reach 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival of Answers said, "This will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we'll have to endure the surprise and the spell.
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to be successful, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Monae, is one of the number of people who are taking the lead this year in New York, who will lead Debra Lee Ferness and Hu Jackman.
U.S. may use WMS for "blocks" to prevent exports of Russian oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, contact the Navy to prevent the exit of Russian energy on the EU and the Middle East," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Son said that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to buy energy just as much as in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the fact, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the possibility of using the Navy to ensure the openness of the sea routes, and, if necessary, to organise a blockade so that their energy would not get to the market," he said.
Zinke turned to members of the partnership organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positioned itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia a "one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These applications were made at a time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of the administration of Trump, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the "wrong" project of the North Stream 2 newspaper, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "frozen" Moscow.
The mask repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 newspaper cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to increase the power of the existing gas station to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is starting in the economy and is an example of unmistakable competition.
"I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans got hit in response to Germany, which again confirmed its acceptance of the project.
The main German industry organization, the German Federation of Researchers (BDI), called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Researchers (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, Lord Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to seriously discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election, states a senator from Massachusetts
The senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the election of the president after the interim election.
During a speech in the Mary of Halioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and order our corrupt government, and I'm also talking about women on the highest farms," she said, according to The Hill."
"After 6 November, I will take very seriously the opportunity to meet with the President."
During a speech in Mary Warren, he defended President Donald Trump, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm extremely worried about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidacy to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
On Friday, Warren wrote in his tweet, "Of course, before the FBI vote is necessary to conduct the investigation."
However, the results of the polls published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters did not believe that it should be fought by the president in 2020.
According to a survey of the center of political research at the University of Safalka/Bostan Globe, fifty-eight "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not fight.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Devil Patrick, where 38 percent were for and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 potential round include former Vice President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Consistently Associated Press Byden stated that he would officially make a decision until November.
In a dining room in support of Donald Trump Sara Polin mentioned posttraumatic syndrome of Trek Polin
The 26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
"What happens to my son after he has returned, I can compare with the results of the gastrointestinal syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are returning to in other families," she said, as she gathered at a meal in support of Donald Trump in Talse, Oklahoma.
Polin called this arrest "a brawl" and claimed that her son, along with other war veterans, "returned a little bit by others, hardened, returned with the question of whether there was the respect that soldiers, pilots, and other soldiers had gained from giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassil, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against women, preventing an attempt to report domestic violence, raising weapons in a drunken state, according to information from Dan Bennet, president of the Wassil Police Department.
Colombia's 18 states and districts support the emergence of a new port policy
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the rejection of a new U.S. policy, which denies the presence of a victim of gang pressure or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and districts of Colombia dropped an analytical note on Friday in Washington to support the policy review on port delivery, NBC News reports.
The full name of the case of Grace against Sess, which was opened in August by the American Union of Civil Rights against federal politics, was not revealed.
She claimed that her "and his friends with a hard gang" had raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused on July 20th in the harbor.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the largest number of requests for entry in the United States are made, as countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. port policy has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which has allowed immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to go to the port.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Reissin, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decade-long leadership experience of states, countries and the world".
"Federal leadership requires that applications for port be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," says the Analytical Note.
The lawyers also said in a note that politics that denies immigrants is making the US economy worse, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "make jobs needed".
Attorney General Jeff Sess ordered in June that immigration judges no longer give a harbour victim of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The case is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views," Sessens said on 11 June, announcing this policy.
The port never meant solving a problem, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
The initial saving job in Paulus. The number of survivors has doubled while trying to find the survivors.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
“It’s all very tense,” says a 35-year-old mother named Riz Kusum, packing her little son with a temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
"Every minute the car "quick" brings the body.
Pure water is very small."
The lodgers began to return to their broken houses, figuring out the cloudy things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-ball earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the number Two Harris, who broke the collar and shoulder, are outside Paul's army hospital, where patients were treated in the streets because of the repeated strong jogging.
In his eyes there were tears when he remembered the feeling of strong underground pushes in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I was silenced under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to the city for marriage.
"I heard a woman call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "propaganda" using "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page commercial in the American newspaper, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's pay add-on to the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China accused of trying to get involved in a election in the U.S. Congress on November 6th.
The prosecution of Trump that China was trying to get involved in American elections indicated that the US officials were calling in a new phase in a conversation with Reuters in a Washington press company in China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, Beijing and Washington have now launched a trade war, resulting in a reciprocal imposition of import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, according to US and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm an exporter like entrepreneurs from the state of Ayava who support the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brandt, a U.S. Ambassador to China and was Governor Ayova, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing was damaging to American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, writing in the author's article on the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by printing advertising in our free press."
“By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Brand.
"And when you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real reflection of other ideas that the Chinese might have on a dangerous path in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers refused to offer" to print his article, although he didn't even name it.
Republika Srpska Dispatches female voters prior to the interim election from the Kavano newspaper, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending candidates for the election of Chief Justice Brett Kavano in the face of several charges of sexual violence, analysts warned that they would get hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most Republicans already show that they were ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Reichar, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
The speaker said that he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national secretary of the progressive MoveOn group in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors launched the November quick! during a demonstration at the Senate Hall, when Republicans who control the legal committee decided to take out the candidacy of Kavano, despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be extremely great," said an independent political analyst, Stu Rottenberg, a news site.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in cities and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before an open statement by Ford, in which she detailed her candidacy charges in the Supreme Court in sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in the answer.
"For the Republican Party it has become some kind of mix," said Michael Start, senior member of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not about the committee voting or about the final vote, or about whether Coffee will happen on the landing. It is about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have reacted to it," notes Hay Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats.
However, it's like the Americans have split up on the question of the law of Ford or Cavano, with a little bit more of it than the last one.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or not to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said that they are sure or not.
In addition to that 38 percent said that, according to their opinion, coffee might or must have been inconceivable in its statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flemish FBI race, they're investigating Ford's charges and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that when he was drunk, he complained to her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate in the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at the evening when they were studying in Eile in 1980.
Global Web Designer plans to start a new Internet application to connect Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global network, launches a startup that will become competitors of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Le Solid platform.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store the data and who has access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lei, he said that in creating Inrupt, he meant "to preach the world."
'You have to do it now,' he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "own Internet storage" or POD.
This may include lists of contacts, rights, calendar, phantom and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to the information.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the potential with data."
According to John Bruce's executive director, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to share resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, several developers working on a contract project and the Valence Leaders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Lee said that he and his team had not talked to Facebook and Google about introducing or not making complete changes if all their business models were reviewed immediately.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday's publication on Medium Berners-Lei, the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet, creating the Consortium of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in promoting network neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Le will become the founder and director of the World Network Corporation, the Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lei added.
Bernard Van: The teaching of a priest awarded by the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded by the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a participant of the battle, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Van was awarded a prize on 29 September 1918 for his part in the Belenglais and Leakur attacks.
But four days later he died of a sniper bullet and never found out that he had won the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptanshire two of his grandsons on the council opened a memorable stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened just 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the San Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under a powerful pink and towering fire of the worker."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, grabbing the rifle himself and blowing out three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a vine after the advice, which appointed the Imperial Young Archdiocese of Brandwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great honor to take part in the council" and added that "the manhood of a real hero has been demonstrated by the support shown by many."
MMA fans all night waited to see Bellator 206, they instead got a lead Pep
Just imagine, you've been staying all night to watch the packaged broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're denied the main event.
The program with San Hase had 13 battles, including six on the main card, and they showed up in the direct atmosphere all night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerr. Musasi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to catch up, looking at Britain, they were just freaking out when the program changed on the lead of Pep.
Some were disappointed after spending an insomnia night, especially waiting for this battle.
One of the painkillers on Twitter called the switch to a child's cub as "someone's stupid joke".
In response to the broadcast question by Dave Schwarz, senior Vice President Bellator on marketing and communication issues, he said: "The state's decree at 6 a.m. was inappropriate and the content had to be changed to a child programme."
"Yes, "Pep's Lead."
Bellator Scott Coker, president of the company, said that in the future they would work on a program to count British audiences.
"I think we're considering the possibility of a repeat, I think we can solve this issue," said Koker.
"But now is the sixth morning on Sunday, and we cannot resolve it until Sunday by our time, and it is Monday by their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe it or not, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the question, considering it to be a technical error.
But that proved to be a state decision.
I can promise you that the next time it doesn't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of catches from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to advise the fans, but we're out of the question.
That's the end of the situation."
"Discussive Island" by Tom Daley felt "unmarked" because of sexuality
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale said that growing with a sense of uncertainty for others because of their sexuality gave him a motivation for success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all the way I am," until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Radio 4's "Free Island Disks," he said he supported gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this pretty old Kirsi Young program took a few months' rest because of the disease.
In the role of the man who appeared on the inhumane island, in Lavern's first program, Daley said that in childhood he felt "less" than everyone else, because "the society didn't accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I now believe that the feeling that you are not as important and insignificant was what gave me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that there was someone," he said, so that he would not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze premiere of the Olympics became a major LGBT activist of the movement and in the Community Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly without persecution and wanted to give hope to others.
The world's three-time champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, director and president of Dastine Lance Blake, who he met in 2013 -- "it was unexpected to me."
Dale married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you pass through such a young age," he said, at the first episode, he was 14 years old, and still after three years his father died of cancer, he said it was hard to find a parlor who would survive such a stroke and falls.
In June they became fathers, their son called Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Daley said his "perspective whole" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold almpic medal.
Robbie is my gold alimpic medal."
His son is also named Robert as his father. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said that his father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
'I couldn't tell him 'you won't be sitting in the first row, Dad,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally understood that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping in the water in front of my balconies at the Alimpis games, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song -- the Proud of the Hizer Small -- which found in it a resounding in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now running.
“Discs of the Inhuman Island” can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. in British summer.
Michelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench of the spare in the Ryder's cube on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson on Sunday set a record, playing his 47 matches in Ryder's cube, but he needs to return the form so that this event does not become unfortunate.
Mikelsan, who will play in this competition, which takes place once or twice, is a record 12th time, the captain of the team Jim Furick has been sitting on a bench for the Saturday forbolts.
Instead of being in the center of the event, and he was often there for the United States team, the five-time winner of the cube divided his days between the work of the cheerleader and the coaches, hoping to return to shape.
Even at the top of his career he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer isn't the ideal choice for an inconvenient Le Golf National field, where they're being severely punished with miscarriage.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Michelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact British Open Francis Malinaire champion who, along with Tommy Flitwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are left at four points at the start of 12 single games start with success, the Mikelsan game can become extremely important.
The Führer expressed confidence in this player, but there was nothing more to say.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on his back, slapped me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furic.
"He is very sure of himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of command in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two matches.
I was planning more, but I was working just like that and that's how we thought we were playing.
He wants to be in the field as well as everyone else."
Mikelson will beat the record of Nick Fald by the number of matches in the Ryder's cube played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cube, which was never the same as achieving in individual games.
In Mikelsan 18 won, 20 lost and seven and a half, although Furick said his presence had brought him the benefit.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with a humour, he likes to joke about people and just a very good man who has a good team," he explained.
"I think that the younger players were pleased to parry his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He's giving the team a lot more than just playing."
Captain of the European team Thomas Burn knows that a big split may soon disappear
Thomas Burne, captain of the European team, from experience, knows that a significant break before individual games last day on Ryder's cube could easily disappear.
The Dutch debuter in the 1997 Walderam match, where the European team under the direction of Seva Ballesterase had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended up with a minimum of 141⁄2-131.2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderam we had a great advantage and we won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where they lost," Bearn said after viewing how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and on Friday, and yesterday, and led by number 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to play for the whole hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the points appear in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and that's an attempt to win this match, that's what we're going to do.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the other hand there are the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players played in the hard field for golf, Burne added, "I will never overcome myself in this.
There will be a completely different game tomorrow.
There will be individual games tomorrow, and that's quite different.
It's just great if you're in the field with your partner and everything goes well, but if you're playing one, then here's your real golfer's talent.
That's what we need to tell the players that they have to show tomorrow the best.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go, and you have to show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Burne, his opponent Jim Furic is looking forward to the best individual game of his athletes than the one they have demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
The Furic himself was on both sides of these games the last day, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the "Medine Miracle."
'I remember every word of it,' he said, answering the question, as Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999 set up his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start, which you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is on those who play the match in the middle.
We've set up a proper schedule and set up the players as we liked them.
Thomas got the task of starting to play and speaking against Rory McCiller in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Paulter were going to play against the golfers.
"I've put my players in this order, because I think I'll close everything like this," said Burne about my choice for individual matches.
Relaunching a new German military ship
The new WMF fleet of Germany had to enter the building in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war-time warships, but it will not appear earlier than next year due to poor systems and ever-increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The Rhineland-Pfalz launch, the main ship of an absolutely new class of Baden-Württemberg fregats, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to get into construction in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction interfered with this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class warships, commissioned in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen-class fractals.
They're going to be armed with powerful weapons, various counter-ships and jet rockets, as well as with some stels technologies, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features, such as longer periods of time between telecommunications, more new fractals may not enter their port for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships, which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power beyond the country, are ageing until they finally enter the line, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year, when the German IMF officially refused to take the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time the Navy fleet returned the ship to the shore after delivery.
The reason for the return is certainly small, but the German media have written about many "defects in software and software" that make the ship empty in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 sailors – half of the crew of the old Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship had a very big weight that reduced its productivity and limited the possibility of further upgrades.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of cost of the whole project, including team learning, there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- although it initially amounted to 2.2 billion.
The problems that come up with new fractals are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is diminishing.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in the German Parliament, said that the IMF "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He claimed that the problem was sometimes increasing, because the old ships were listing, and the ships were not replacing.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class members were able to join the IMF.
National memorialist society listened to the storyteller's secret life
A new study that is being conducted in the Scottish Mountains, aimed at identifying how they use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behaviors of unique birds of milk and help in future actions to save these animals.
The research of the National Society of Archaeology in Scotland is done by small bats and also by the stormy long-haired bats of Dabanton in the Inver Gardens of Western Ross.
Special writing tools will be placed in the main positions of this location to watch the events of the bats during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will do mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records determines the frequency of the calls of the bats, as well as what they say.
A flashcard and a report map will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, an advisor to the National Society for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to the storytellers and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of creating such habitats as wolves, and how to support forests for the survival of bats and other animals associated with them.
The number of stories in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as adhesive feeders for flies and some chemicals for building materials.
They're not blind at all.
But because of their nightlife ears spoke more audible than eyes when it came to hunting.
They're using a complex exhalation technique to detect bumps and obstacles in the flight path.
National society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about stories.
There are ten trained experts who regularly do research, check their place of residence, and sometimes save lives.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish storytellers in the town of Trav in Dhamfris and Galaway, where eight of the ten species of storytellers lived.
David Thompson's monkey manager says it's an ideal area for bats.
"Here, in Trew, we just have a great place for the bats," he said.
"We have old houses, many old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about stories yet, so our work here and in other monkeys will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
It underlines the importance of checking for the presence of bats before carrying out the property repair, since one seat can be accidentally destroyed by killing 400 males and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
Criminals are under shelter and they are forbidden to kill, fear, worry or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, a member of the Watch Tower Society in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our stories, and we don't even know how their populations live."
Ranald's acquittal of rape charges, and his lawyers are going to trial for German journalism
Christian Ranald called his charges of rape "faecal news," saying people want to "advertise themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial for the German journal Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
Forwards of the gathering of Portugal and Juventusa were charges of assaulting American Catherine Majorg in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he would have paid her $375 000 for the silence, wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In a 33-year-old Instagram Live video, Ranaldo addressed 142 million of his subscribers several hours after publishing the indictments, calling it "faecal news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the gold sword's five-time owner in front of the camera.
"They want to advertise on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, the law of Ranaldo has filed a case against Der Spiegel's journal on charges that have been referred to as "an invalid message of suspicion in a private case," states the agency Reuters.
Christian Heart's lawyer said that the player would need compensation for "the moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
As if the incident took place in June 2009 in the luxury rooms of the Palms Howell and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Having met at the night club of Ranald and Majorg as if they had returned to the football player's room, where he would have raped her Annalously as written in the papers of the district court of Clarke in Nevada.
Major says that after that, Ranald kneeled and said that at 99 percent he was a "good guy" who suffered from "one percent".
The papers say that Ranaldo admitted that they had sex, but they agreed.
Majora also claims that she went to the police and took photos of the damage in the hospital, but then agreed to the extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would "publicly bring it down."
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge, because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
In time, if the case were to take place, Ranald was going to go to the Madrid Real from Manchester Unity, and this summer he went to the Italian Youth, closing the deal in 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "always harms" the loss of car builders
Britain is "always damaging" when it loses its position as world car building leader after Brexit, said Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that his "anxious" statement by Toyota UK to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without registration, the company will temporarily cut production at the Bernston plant, near Derby half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that a delay on the limits resulting from Brexit without notice could lead to job cuts.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis factory in Bernston last year released nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“In my view, when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how a cross-border trade will take place when Britain leaves the EU without a mention, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it closes its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main problem is that car builders are talking about the risk of supply chains resulting from Brexit without mention.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "precisely in time", when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU for cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without a record, there may be breaks on the borders that lead to delays and missing parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to keep the factory in Derby more than a day's spare part, the company said, so the production stopped.
Mr Clarke said that the "Plan Checkers" of the Theresa may about future relations with the EU "was made precisely to avoid these checks on borders".
"We need an agreement, we want to get the best agreement, which will not only allow today's success, but also allow us to make use of this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we must be able to continue the work of successful supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would not work, but for the future, the cost of reducing the competitiveness of the plant and reducing jobs.
Peter Cualaris, who works in Bernston for 24 years and is a trade union coordinator, said that the trade union members are very concerned: "On my request, if the jobs are cut short, they will no longer recover.
The government's president said: "We have proposed an accurate plan for our future relations with the EU, which deserves trust."
The White House states that a tromp meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deposited for another week", while the fight around the candidacy to the Brett Kavano Supreme Court, said a Belgian house representative on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying the involvement of Russia's electorate, the liaison of Trump's assistants with Russia, and the potential impediment to justice on the part of the president.
Release the Trump assistant general's attorney or not, and thus put Muller's independence at risk, pouring oil for months into the Washington records fire.
Early this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from the crew with 25 corrections.
Rosenstein rejected it.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the midst of a hearing about what was going to fall off.
Instead, it was announced that Thursday would meet with Trump, who was then in the AAN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing in the legal committee of the Senate, where Kavano and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Kavano, which slowed down the Senate vote.
The president of the Trump Sara Sanders appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's possible that this week, perhaps, at the next week, I think that, more quickly, a week later, all the other things that have a place in the Supreme Court's case are taken into account.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the newest information."
Some journalists are willing to explain her statement: Sanders didn't use press briefings in the White House on 10 September.
Conducting a program by Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings was called without disrespect for the television reporters who were "working on the audience," although she added, "I remember that they are working on the audience."
Then she said that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is meeting more with the press questions than any president who was before him," she added, without any specific facts: "We have studied these numbers."
Briefings are happening, Sanders reported, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, you've seen how we've done this in the last few weeks.
Trump regularly answers questions if he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's own press conference rarely takes place.
This week in New York, the president was showing why, when he was free and sometimes extravagance in front of reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to EU health workers in Scotland's health system in front of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's health care system to express their gratitude for the country's name and wish they could stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of EU citizens living in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The talks between Britain and the EU continued in the summer, leading to the expected decisions in this fall.
But the British government also accelerated the preparation for the script without a mention.
I know that for all of you this is a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU, and not only, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care, also benefit patients and our community.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent a period of surgery after a head trauma
The linebacker teams of Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie underwent a temporary operation after receiving a head trauma in a Sunday match, which his team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Authority of Tennessee.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Rodhrod told the reporter that the injured player had got soon to stop.
"He went to the side line and suddenly fell," said Rhodes.
Coaches and doctors gave Abercombi oxygen still in the field before putting it on the force and moving it to establish a diagnosis.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "more detail about what the trauma was" and Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Abercombi, a second-class sportsman, was the first to run the Tennessee State season after leaving Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full seizures, which gives a total of 18 seizures per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a large fee
According to a new conservative plan, foreign British real estate buyers will pay higher taxes and additional money will go to help homeless
This action neutralises the success of the Corbin initiative by attracting young voters
The increase in government remittances is attributable to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Today Theresa May announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher government remittances and additional money will go to help homeless.
This action is seen as trying to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative in attracting young voters, as well as providing affordable housing. It's directed at people with high income.
The increase in government remittances is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the UK, and the money they get will go to the government's housing programme.
An increase in the current state remittance, including a higher level, taken two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and for rent, can set up to three percent.
The finance ministry expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and the new buyer is making it difficult to buy his first residence.
Many rich regions of the country, particularly the capital, have become "city-of-laws", because a large number of buyers are not living in Britain for the most part.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after calling Barris Johnson to reduce the state remittance for young buyers to ease the acquisition of the first residence.
He accused huge construction companies of maintaining high prices for immovable property by taking over the land and not using it, and called upon May to cancel the quotas for an available dwelling to repair the 'disgusting situation with the dwelling' in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of live reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the cessation of "unsubstantiated" eviction.
He also wanted to convey to the local council more powers in the area of residential construction.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I stated that my commitment to the position of Prime Minister for the renewal of the British dream must be the best way of life for every new generation.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
But it's unfair that people who don't live in Britain and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too many people dream of having their own house become increasingly inaccessible, and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish collective"
Coach Sanderland told Jack Ross that his main ambition was ever to become a coach of the Scottish Congregation.
The 42-year-old skater is doing the task of restoring the club from the north-east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He went on this job in the summer, after he returned to St. Mary's in the Scottish premier League last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," said Ross in BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up, often ill for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's a possibility if I'm a successful club coach."
Among Rosa's predecessors are the Sanderland coach Dick Advocate, David Mois, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poie and Paula di Kani.
Former coach Aloo Atletik says he didn't feel afraid of such famous names in such a big club, before rejecting the proposals from Barnes and Ipswich Taunn.
"Now I'll be happy to answer the question, 'Will I be able to return this club to the Prime Minister of the League?'
According to the structure and material base of his club's place certainly in the Prime Minister's Liz," he said.
"Not just to get him back there, but I'll consider my job a success only if I can get the club back there."
Ross only works as a coach for three years, until then he was a coach in Damberton and worked for 15 months at the Harts training station.
Then he helped Aloo come back from the third league and turn San Miren from a failure that almost won the next season in the Championship.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a Clyde player, Hartulpool, Falkirk, San Miren and Hamilton Academic.
Reflecting on the work at Aloa, he said, "This was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training is what I need, even more than playing.
Sounds amazing because I worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm going through it now when I talk about stress and pressure, but training is what it takes.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing this, and it's the best time for me to grow up."
The full interview can be heard in Sportssound on Saturday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 in British summertime
A study of the ideal time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 a.m.
The hot summer increased the arrivals of British pubs struggling for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the pubs and bars, sales grew by 2.7 percent in June, but sales decreased by 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA's advisory business group, which collected this statistics, said: "The longer the sun's weather and the longer it was expected, the longer it took for the English congregation to participate in the World Championship final, the more things that happened in June when the pubs increased sales by 2.8 percent, and the more the restaurants suffered.
The drop in sales in restaurants was 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in June.
The pubs and bars that basically sell the drinks until they've shown the best result compared to the restaurants.
The beans, which sell more food, were also warmed to the sun, though not as strong as the restaurant.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In strawberries and bars, the sale of alcohol grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on recreation and accommodation, said, "These results are becoming the trend that we see at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes on the public food market.
It's no wonder that restaurants continue to compete, because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come in the worst time for operators focused on food, and time will show whether the temperatures in August bring such a expected relief."
The overall growth in tree and restaurant sales, including recent openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand opening.
A tool for showing sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups, which have a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is an important guide to this sector.
Each fifth child has a secret account in the networks which it hides from the parents
Research has shown that every fifth child -- some have only filled 11 -- has secret accounts on the networks that they hide from parents and teachers
The study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of faecal Insta pages
This news was heated by the fear that there would be sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that showed their father
Every fifth child -- some have only filled 11 -- creates online accounts that keep them secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in faecal Insta's accounts, which would lead to Instagram's photography exchange.
This news has fueled the fear that there are sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they're keeping "clean" "main" accounts to show their father, and they're also having private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she called others "to rape me."
A study conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchenan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they can't be found by their parents or teachers."
Elid Doyle will be the voice of sportsmen in the Scottish Council of Light Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle, Scotland's most well-known lightweight and senior Ien Byte, described this event as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her experience at the most diverse levels, an international figure in the past decade.
“Ailid is highly respected in Scotland, Britain and the world sports community, and we are sure that a lightweight athlete in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council,” said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope to help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals in other Olympics, and who is now an expert on BBC, can't walk after the micro-insult.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only take time to see if I could make it right and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I completely improved, learned to walk again, and now I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support message."
Advertising a small pump where mothers are compared to cows has shared their views on the Internet
The small pump production company has shared its views by issuing an ad comparing feeding women to cows that they feed.
To mark the launch of what they call "the world's first installed small pump" the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music advertisement on the basis of a video to show the freedom that this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a cow with cows under the song where there are the words, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you don't notice, it doesn't wash, it's my breast."
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I'm feeding the baby, yeah, yeah, I'm giving my women."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the Facebook page, called for a hot discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and born to give milk, here only their children pick up in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is unmarkedly hidden in the petals
Another comment: "I understood traumaticly for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them to advertise a small pump for a mother who doesn't have children?"
Someone said, "This is such an unintended advertisement."
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was fun.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I had breast-feeding.
The milk-drinking makes me feel cow-like.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun ad directed at mothers who turn off milk pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and hear themselves "cows".
It does not approve of advertising and does not condemn small-scale industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with invisible tiny pumps hidden in the busts.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely inactive, has no rights, no pipes and is impractically hidden in the chewing room for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave the house during the work of the device.
Anna Balarin, a partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a clear and correct start.
Conducting a parallel between feeding women and small cows we wanted to pay attention to the removal of milk and its difficulty, at the same time demonstrating in a fun and good way how a new small pump will bring about an extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's tiny pump is at the center of attention.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage in clothing from Martha Jacobowski, using this product.
Hundreds of children migrants without forest noise transport to a residential camp on the technologic border
Although the number of border crossings per month has almost remained unchanged, there has been a sharp increase in the number of detainees, partly because of the harshness of the rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration, which have burdened children with sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are careful to put their own country at risk, taking responsibility for the child.
Risks have increased significantly in June when federal authorities have announced that a potential sponsor and other full-time homeowners will need to submit fingerprints and data to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-ranking employee of the Immigration and Customs Service, spoke before Congress with a report on arrests by tens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without association.
Later, the agency was informed that 70% of those arrested had no courtrooms.
"Approximately 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their homeowners are illegal in the country, and much of them are aliens with a criminal past.
That's why we continue to pursue such people," said Mr. Albens.
To speed up child treatment, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, as said by housekeepers, before the standard period was 60 days.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status as an immigrant judge will have to use video surveillance instead of being in court personally.
People who do not have enough credit for this will soon be deported.
According to the employees of shelters and messages from sources in the system that have appeared in the last few months, the longer the children remain in captivity, the more likely the onset of depression or anxiety may lead to explosions of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, such as Ternilla, these problems are much stronger, as the evidence that a child is in poor condition is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children into a residential city without providing time for emotional preparation or for development with friends can make the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the U.S., France and Turkey
In return for the AAN General Assembly Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
Müller, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian land, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at the Assembly meeting.
Mualam insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes, “the war with terrorism is practically over”.
He announced that Damascus intends to continue "telling this holy battle until we clear all the Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "a loving illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who are mainly instructors and advisers to the Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Assad.
France's earthly contingent in this war-torn country is made up of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualam stated that conditions for return are acceptable and accused "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fears that include refugees abroad.
"We call upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to pass on their return," he says.
"They are politising exclusively the humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be given renewed help until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The AAN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last fierce resistance of the Idlib rebels created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty has prevented a wide-ranging attack by the Russian forces in the area where three million people live.
However, Mualam stressed that the treaty had "precise deadlines", and expressed the hope that the war would be directed against the Gjihadists, including the number of soldiers from the Al-Qaeda front of Nusr, who would "be destroyed".
Ambassador AAN Staffan de Mistur hopes to call for the first sessions of the new committee, which will be made up of government and opposition representatives, to develop the constitution sent to Syria and set the way for elections.
The author expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to "a review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump's gonna go on a second term?
On this basis, Mr. Trump will win in the 2020 election, when, as many Liberals expect, the implicity and scandal will not end in time.
And it's definitely going to be "The only dramatic presidential final in all history!"
At this point, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, premium ratings have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times – up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
Nielsen reports that in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show channel, MSNBC, collected 3.5 million viewers on the screen and exceeded cable TV ratings in the evening when the main news was broadcast.
"It's a fire to which people are drawn, because we don't understand it," says Neil Bear, director of the ABC drama "Peremenik" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who become president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nelly Scowell, a writer and writer of the book "A couple of funny details and a few harsh truths about getting into a club of Hollywood boys," has another theory.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
- She asked.
He said, "Because he's making me happy," said Miss Scowell.
Chaos precious yet and that may comfort.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television, the modern lines that come out of Washington can become as definite a future as the one against Wade, depending on whether the families of immigrants are able to unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you look at the sixth hour as a group of experts are considering Bob Woodward's use of non-printing information in the book "Strah", a $5,000-skin jacket by Paul Manafort with a scarf skin (a suit of shame, as written in "The Washington Post"), and the consequences of the harsh descriptions of Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it is beyond the simple limits of wanting to be in the course of business.
I will never, for example, look at Super Mary just as before.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you look at the reality of the show he shows every evening," says Brant Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars about the variable actor composition of the Trump Show and the constant rotations of the theme ("sparing" with the NFL, approval by Kim Chen INA).
You can't let yourself miss even one episode, otherwise you'll stay away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fles this week, behind the windows of his house on the north shore of the Couay stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees hot, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing down the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not when Brett Cavan stood before the Senate's Judicial Committee, considering the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on a wall.
"I remember the kids when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External cash flows flow into a sharp pre-selecting election in the House of Representatives
It's not surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania closed the cash bay thanks to the change in the boundaries of the Congress, which is why two candidates participate in the elections in one place.
A recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh surrounds a democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lamb, who won his place in another district in the elections last spring.
Lambu opposes another active deputy, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in November found that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district led to a decline in the funding of the company by the main party financial groups, the Democratic Company Congress Committee (DRC) and the National Republic Company Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory over the wide-ranging election in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a break in 20 points.
Political experts are a small advantage for the Democrats.
U.S. assessed El Salvador's sentence for China's support and then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing, despite a minor conflict on the part of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners had expelled the Tromp team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call off US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," said State Secretary Heser Nawert early this month.
However, sanctions were only discussed in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including the number to control drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for the Central American country with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
As a result of the completion of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic growth, which would continue to be a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step in preventing immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had come to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped discussing El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension will now take part in a conference to be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's commitment to entrepreneurship.
And the three American ambassadors without the noise of the past returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh sentencing or punishment from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including the number of two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues while keeping anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by other analysts close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be to report to Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to justice by Mr. Trump, on what are the examples of what is currently very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller has taken note in the investigation of the possibility of a contract with Trump and Russia in an election attack.
When Congress changes the lord, Mr. Trump turns up before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is about to speak again before the electors, and perhaps, in the end, before the jury of his colleagues.
There's a lot of kali, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like it is in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, have to make a choice which will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready for the coup against Hitler, if only West had shown opposition to him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We've suffered failure and let go of the possibility of avoiding the next few years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such fragile moments, and the relentless march of democracy hastens or postpones.
Right now, Americans have been confronted with a few of these fragile moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump fires the lieutenant general's attorney-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about what he had suggested last year secretly to write the president's words and thought about his professionality.
Mr. Rosenstein says the "The Times" story is not correct.
"How will we react if the recent FBI inquiry into Brett Kawan's case is not universal or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the worthiness of the charges of sexual violence and inconsistencies?
And first of all, will we vote on the election for Congress, which will attract Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't go through these trials, we're going to have a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we're not going to teach thanks to the lesson I took in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Hebrew, who was deported in Asvencim by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Polish house.
She survived, migrated to America, and after 60 years sent me to light the Saturday candles on this table with a swastika.
With what legacy can I not be an optimist in relation to our future?"

Grem Dorans of the Rangers is optimistically set to match the Rapid Vienna match.
"Randers" are taking "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over "Villareal" earlier this month will allow them to leave the G League of Europe for sure.
The knee trauma prevented Grem Dorans from performing for the first time in the 2-2 season with the Williams, but he thinks that the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampline.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong opponent," says a 31-year-old footballer.
"We started the game, thinking that we could get something, and earned a point.
Maybe at the end we could have killed the ball, but at the end of the night it was also a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half field.
There'll be another big one on Thursday night for European football.
I hope we can make three points, but it'll be a complicated game, as they have shown a good result in the last game, but considering the crowd of players in the courts, I'm sure we'll be able to cope with them and show them a good game.
Last year was determined hard, both because of my trauma and change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of certainty.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope we can move forward, achieve the outcome of the last season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the interviewers had an accurate idea of who they wanted to take care of, few of them talked about it with their families.
About half the people who participated in the nationwide research reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide for life insurance.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Consider this with your husband and children: your family won't be ready to help you if you don't get your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and the family and consider where and how to get medical help, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.

In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic dot
The man got a few drops from a pneumatic pint when he went home at night.
About 40 years old, he was in the Oxford Grove district of Ilfracombe, the county of Davon, when he was shot in the chest, life, and arm.
Police officers described a shooting that took place about 02:30 a.m. locally, as a "random event".
The patient did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to life, the police ask a witness to contact them.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that fell on the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, and it is expected that the number of people who died will grow up.
Because of the disconnection of the agents involved in humanitarian aid, they couldn't get any information from Dongal's Regent, a district north of Paul, which is close to the 7.5-ball earthquake.
In Pala, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a severe disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slovenes:
Paul is the capital of the municipality of Central Solawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Solawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake came and the tsunamis came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the foundation.
Dongala is a reagent that is spread over 180 miles (300 km) of the coastal line in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative unit with a status below the rank, with 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and rural households are the main economics of the Central Solawesi government, especially the Dongal coastal region.
The collection of nickel is also important to the government, but mainly concentrated in Morawali, on the opposite coast of the Sulawesi.
According to data from the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of Sick Disasters, Paul and Dongal have suffered tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami in Dongal, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit Dongal in the western part of 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and it is regularly rocking earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indian government of Acheh in north of Summer 26th of December triggered tsunamis that covered 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Acheh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes took place on the western coast of Sumara at the end of March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake 6.8 took place south of Java, the densely populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that covered the southern coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-ball earthquake occurred in Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the Mentava islands outside of Summertime, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed ten villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake defended the Regent of Pizza Jaya in the province of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, as he reminded people of the devastation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunamis didn't come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: strong earthquakes have taken cover for the tourist island of Indonesia Lambok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.
Sarah Paline's older son was arrested for domestic violence in the family
Track Paline, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and Vice-Central Officer of Sarah Paline, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Paline from Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, which conflicted with information about domestic violence and counter-arrestment published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when one of the acquaintances tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU, Paline is in the next Matanusko-Susitna insulate under a $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "precisely innocent," when he was asked whether he would admit his guilt, the network reported.
Paline is accused of three Class A crimes, which threatens him to release his freedom for up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also been charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by the release of a day's freedom and the $200 fine.
It's not the first time Paline's charges have been brought.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paline.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaskan vet court.
In November 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with reports of domestic violence, and with the possession of arms in a state of alcoholism in connection with the incident.
His girl argued that he had hit her face.
Sarah Payne was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for her son's harsh behavior with posttraumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The Earthquake with a force of 7.5 balls called for the tsunamis and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and networks are not working together, and the number of victims is expected to grow in the next few days.
The earthquake took place close to central Slovenia, which is in the north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
And social networks have a lot of video that shows a moment of impact.

The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is charged with a death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipa, 30 years old, apparently used a pick-up truck from the Home Depot company in October to travel on a bicycle along the six West Side in Lower Manhattan, crossing footpaths and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to a report of intention to obtain the death penalty in South York County, prosecutors must prove that Saipa's "intentional" has broken eight people and "inadvertently" has suffered serious bodily damage.
According to the court's case-law, for both violations, the possible measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Ashalmila Saipov's prosecution of 22 counts, which included eight charges of murder in support of the missile, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of means of transport.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "old and intentional planning", while describing Saip's crimes, they used such phrases as "disgusting, cruel and vicious".
"Syfula Habibulaevich Saipaw caused injuries, caused damage and brought loss to his family and friends by Dieu Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lory Decadt, Dorena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Feruk, Erna Dieu Mends and Alejandro Damien Pagnuk," reports the intention.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with a death penalty in South New York County, it has been ten years.
Halid Barnes' respondent was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death two years before they were convicted of espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenbergs were sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipa, an exit from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of conscientious objection in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said that he felt satisfaction from his action.
According to the prosecution, Saipaov informed the authorities that he was being attacked by a video viewer of the Islamic state on the phone.
He also requested permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital, reported to the police.
He doesn't recognize himself guilty of the conviction, which is made up of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "unsatisfied" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not the life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A member of the parliament from Thora says that Nigel Faraj should set up Brexit talks.
Today, during a protest at the Tory Nigel Faraj conference, he vowed to "mobilise the national army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "taste discomfort" from the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's MPs offered their candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party of Peter Bown said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have "extended" if Mr. Faraz had hired a tailor's crew on Brexit.
But the problem encountered by Mrs. May, trying to reconcile her different supporters, was even worse when the Tori, who are in favour of preserving EU membership, made a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister of all forces is trying to preserve the Compromise Treaty of the Czech Republic under constant pressure from both supporters and workers of the EU itself.
Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force the Eurosceptics and the Liberians to choose between the package and the "disaster".
Mr. Bown said he was going to a meeting in Salihalle on the way out (Leave Means Leave) that he wanted to "remove the Checker from the board".
He proposed that Mr. Faraday make the same and undertake the duties of speaking with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out," he said.
A member of the parliament from Wellingbor added, "I'm behind Brexit, but we need to leave the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We do not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely irrelevant."
Brexit's supporter and Thora's member, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and in conversation with the journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Checkers' plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party and activists who actually go out in the street and pick us out.
Please reject the plan and start listening."
In a brief return to Mrs. May, she added: "The Prime Ministers will remain on the crew if they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians need to "taste discomfort" when they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us – people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "This is not going to happen to you."
In turn, he added, "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never be at peace until we become independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit workers went through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists were wearing the Tories Against Brexit banners after the group was launched in these outlets.
The Liberian Per Lord Adanis met with the conservatives on the occasion of the security problem they faced because of the party program when they opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technologies for Canada plus, without training, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full page.
The thing like a good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of negotiating the president's crew
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after her election in November she "will pay close attention to the process of paving the President's seat".
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts announced his future on Saturday during a general east in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticised by President Donald Trump, is going to be re-elected and opposed by a member of the Republic's Jeff Diell Party, which was the leading company of Trump in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of the discussion as a potential Trump opponent in 2020.
From the time Trump entered the crew, it was already the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general east which took place on Saturday in Hallioke.
One of the participants asked whether she was planning to compete with the president.
Warren replied that the time had come for "the women to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and for this to happen, there must be a woman."
The arrest took place after the death of the basketball player Sims from the Louisiana State University team
The Baton-Royal Police, Louisiana's state, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder of the basketball player, Mr. Wade Sims, had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton-Royal Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dietan Simpson at a press conference that took place 11 hours in the morning in the east.
On Friday they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was on it.
Sims was shot on Friday morning by a South University campus.
"Wade Simms has been shot in the head as a result of his death," said Murphy J. Paul, a journalist on Saturday's channel "247sports" police chief.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of Simpson's investigation, he confessed to what was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not oppose the arrest and was taken into custody in the East Boton-Roy County police station.
Sportsman-Junior grew 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) grew in Baton-Roz, Sims last season played 32 games, 10 of which were on the course from the beginning, on the average spent 17.4 minutes on the course, wasted 5.6 points and scored 2.9 scores for the game.
Grand Prix Russia: Louis Hamilton approached the title of the world's championship after having won the victory over Sebastian Fetel by an internal agreement
From the moment Walter Botos ordered on Saturday on the qualifying train Luis Hamilton, it became clear that the instructions within the Mercedes team were playing a significant role in the race.
Botos pulled a good place on the tailor and almost left Hamilton at the will of fate, until he defended his place at the first two turns and invited Fetel to attack his friend by command.
The chair first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton kneeling at the end of the common crowd of riders, namely this manoeuvre had to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to the pit stop at a later time and went out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came out after several round-in maneuvers, which forced Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking holding back after a double maneuver to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstipen on his 21st birthday started from the back of the grid and until the end of the first round was in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, while holding the dogs, because he wanted to finish fast, chase Kimi Rykanen and take the fourth place.
As a result he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds, so Rykanen took fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Walter all the outgoing speeches were fantastic and said himself a real gentleman, when I would be allowed to say so.
"The team has done a great job to take the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump smiled at Senator Diana Finstein's meeting on Saturday because she insisted that it was not the source of Christine Blaise Ford's escape, in which she accused the candidacy of the Supreme Court of Brett Kawan in sexual violence.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the Ford data before the Senate Judicial Committee, rather than commenting on what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "slow, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that can happen, and the most beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see wicked, filthy and false people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and escapes, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document, "oh, what?
No, no.
I had nothing to do with it."
Wait a minute.
We let go... no, we didn't let go," he said, instructing the senator.
Finstein sent a letter in June with a detailed statement of charges against Kawan against Ford, and he ran away early in September -- but Finstein denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story run," said Finstein's committee, "the Hill."
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I was satisfied with her request."
But her refusal probably didn't like the president, who so commented at the Saturday meeting: "This is what I'm telling you, it was a really bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidacy in the Supreme Court, accused of three women's sexual assaults, the president suggested that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return themselves to power by any means.
You can see the state, the measure, and they don't care who they hurt, who has to go through to get power and control," says President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dandy Star - Belfast Jaints 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two clubs for the Giants in a match against Dandi
Dandi Stewart played for the Friday defeat by Belfast Giants in the elite league, winning the back match with the number 5-3 in the domestic match on Saturday.
Thanks to the impact of Patrick Deweyer and Francis Bavillee Jaints led on two sticks at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie drew the number before Doier restored the leadership of the Jantes.
François Bushar of Dandy equaled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen won the victory team in two rounds.
This became the third defeat in the elite league for the Adam Keef team, which won Dandi with number 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season; in the previous three matches, the Giants won.
The first goal for the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed Doier from the fall of Kendall McFol, and in four minutes Baville doubled the number after the fall of David Rutherford.
In the first period (13:10) Sullivan opened a number on the Lord's side of the field, and then Koon equaled the number after Matt Markvard's transmission (15:16).
The driver provided the JAANTs with leadership on the way out for the first break, killing his second match at the end of the first period.
Taking the side, he regrouped, and the Busher re-balanced the account, killing the grid while the number was being used to carry out the command (27:37).
Coun and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen bring Dandy out for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory along with the fifth team number in the middle of the last period.
Jantes, who have already lost four of the last five meetings, are playing the last match on the homecoming platform against Milton Kanes on Friday.
Ginny's airman, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
The air inspector in Indonesia died heroicly, ensuring a successful flight of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared without news after the massive earthquake on the island of Slovene on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
Strong underground races continue, and many people are buried under the clouds in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues had escaped by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his crew at the Dispatcher Hill, which the savage jumped to the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained on the scene until 6321 Batik Air, which was at the time on the airfield, was released from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the airbag when he decided that she was going to crash.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Australian news agency Air Navigation Indonesia, Johanne Siruitt, the constable's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We were preparing a helicopter from Baliccapan to Calimantan, which was supposed to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before how the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities of the country are careful that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and the agencies for reducing the risk of stressful disasters claim that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Button is limited.
A representative of Sutopa Purvo Nugroho said, "Perhaps the number of victims has increased, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig from under the clouds."
The waves, which were up to six meters away, devastated Paul, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Cousuma's 35-year-old mother, Sky News, said, "Every minute the car's moving fast."
Pure water is not enough.
There's shops all over the place."
Jan Helfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but anything can get a lot worse."
President of Indonesia, Jack Ood, arrived at Paul on Sunday and told the soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Earlier this year in Indonesia, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lambok.
Micronesian Aviation Disaster: According to Air Niugini, one man passed without news after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which had an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously confirmed that all 47 passengers and crew had successfully evacuated from the plane that was flying, and is now reporting disappearance without the news of one passenger.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday, she couldn't report the location of a single passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the following to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane landed on the water while trying to land at the Chuvk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday; they were all stable.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remains unclear.
According to both airlines and the U.S. V.S.A., the plane landed in the lagoon, not flying to the crew lane.
And according to some witnesses, the plane jumped the landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It's very successful," said Janes.
According to him, he and the others were able to walk through the belts in the water to the crash exits of the plane, which had already drowned.
He said that the bartenders panicked and began to yell, as well as that he had got a little head trauma.
The U.S.A. reports that the mariners who have compensated for the nearby port have also helped rescue by using an inflated boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sinks at a depth of about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea in the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to the Air Niugini.
Analyst renews the course of events at night when a woman was burned by a living creature
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning the inhabitants of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Roulette showed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the phone records to locate the 29-year-old defendant Quintana Telis and 19-year-old Victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As The Clarion Ledger reported, according to Roulette, he got information about the place from several mobile phones, which showed that Telis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous statement.
When it was reported that his cell phone was next to Chambers' phone at the time, according to his claim, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were going to invite Sanford.
Sénford gave the signs on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he was not in the city.
When the defendant's side asked whether Tellis was telling the truth about what Sanford was doing that evening in the van, he said that he was "lieting, as my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was the claim to Tellis that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis had removed her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He's got her out of his life," said Haley.
The protection side must begin side-by-side on Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to take a negative view of this genre, filling his music with stable institutions.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says that hip-hop has distanced himself from its sources: political statements and ostracismal issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make again a conscious hip-hop popular.
Such performers as Akala and Lowkey returned to a collection such as The Fugees and Common, a popularity in Britain.
Another black-skinned one?!
She's not from New York to the marriage court for a "racist" message after her release.
She's not from New York for divorce after receiving a message from her mother that she's "one more black-skinned".
The couple denies that they are racists, balancing the call to "exhaustion."
In 2016, Linci Plasca-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new bride, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
"No, I'm still black," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Faxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
According to New York Post, “the problem was that Plasco-Faxman felt a problem,” said Miss Morris, claiming that the earlier girl, who was also an African American, had a bad job, and that she was waiting for her Philippines instead.
Miss Morris paid the day off and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is going to be a couple in court and even though he's getting compensation for the release according to the conditions that he originally hired, even without contract: $350 a day for six months with his life.
"I want to show them what it's not right to do," she said on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges in racism, asserting that the release of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her what she should not have said.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plaska's husband, Post.
"Would you trust your children to whom the roughness has come, even by chance?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Don't you?"
The plane is equal to the call for "depression" and reports that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
‘And will you become a persecutor in such a position?
It's pretty harsh," added an investment banker.
Although the judiciary continues, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, subjecting them to strict criticism of their behavior and logic.
The Podgton publishers made sure that readers would not oppose the bears who speak in a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yangkel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of the one who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's so interesting to read that, knowing about the great success of Padington."
She said that her father, who was working with the BBC operator, had to write a book for children about the little toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work had not been accepted and added that the 60-year-old edition of the book was "horrible-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, saying about Padungton, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all rebellious," she said.
'But since Podungton was so real to him, it was almost parental honor for the child that something came up: you would be proud of them, though it really is not your merit.
I think he's been looking at the success of Podington precisely in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave due devotion to the Podington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to talk to her on the phone
After the installation of her daughter, she was delivered to Nica Louis Paster's hospital 2, where doctors made an empty struggle for her life.
"Old phoned regularly to tell you everything was really bad that she couldn't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
"Then I called over to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to talk to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who gave her to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that there was everything unfolding.
I couldn't stand, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because there were family and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperez, who had survived the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know what to do.
'No one knew,' she said.
"I bowed my head and upon my face all the time passed tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was in the field that I felt Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are sad about the cards to prevent you from killing yourself on a bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do everything in their power to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are issuing cards on hot words and phone numbers that people can get help on a bridge in Wales.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 years of age, he ended his life by suicide.
'I don't want other parents to feel as I do,' she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a talented boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
The people said that his smile would light up any room."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body when he died of suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried that this can have unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards so that people knew there were people in the world who you could call and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Hasfris, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, who spent 15 years with her, shortly after his mother died.
'He didn't say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that,' she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but it had to be with this life: 'In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But we need to keep living and fighting."

Future Brett Coffee is uncertain because the FBI is investigating
"I thought that we could have what he was -- limited in time and scope of investigation -- we could get some union," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "disquieting" because of what had actually happened.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dissatisfaction is sometimes explained.
The interim elections will take place only after five weeks, on 6 November -- if Republicans are expected to suffer suddenly, then they will be weakened in their efforts to choose from the Supreme Court for their candidacy.
George Bush called the senator to seek Mr. Kavano's support, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There's going to be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
Until you understand whether Mr. Cavano will have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Penso to resolve the issue of voting equality and to confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees decreased during Kim's management
The number of refugees from North Korea to South fell from when Kim Chen and I came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo Sun, bringing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said there were 1127 refugees last year, and in 2011 there were 2706.
Mr. Park said that the main reasons are strengthened cross-checks between North Korea and China and higher costs that have been imposed by contractors for reform.
Phenyan didn't comment on it at all.
Most of the refugees from the north with what South Korea citizens get.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, with the longest border in North Korea. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas, which is very strong.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often they are forced to repatriate.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still in war – has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan for talks on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in June in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to the purpose of fully ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, R. Y. Ho, accused the American sanctions in the absence of progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to be the first to disarm," said Mr. Rey in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brett Cavano an "Isterical," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
A minority leader in Nancy Pelozy's Chamber of Representatives called a candidate at the Brett Kavano Supreme Court and stated that in his temper he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelozy said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if a woman did that to herself, she would be called an "historic," said Pelozy about her reaction to the Cavano speech before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
There was an emotional objection to the accusation of sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and could not speak when his family and the senior classes were discussing.
He also strongly accused the democrats in the committee, calling charges against his "gratian and organised killings" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pélózy stated that he believed that the presentation of the Cavano showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly showed that he had primacy against the Democrats.
"I think that he has discredited himself by his statements and by the way in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelós prevented her when she was asked whether she would try the Kawano implicitly, when he was selected and when the Democrats got most of the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so--if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he shouldn't only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelozy.
At this point, Cavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Pelozy added that as a member of a democratic party, she was concerned about the potential solutions of Kawano against the law on accessible medicine or in the case of Rowo against Wade, because Kavano was considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings on the Cavano crew did not answer the questions, or would he cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, objective persons to work in court and to expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'," said Pelozy.
And a woman must be able to do it.
It's an excused prosecution speech, months and years of anger just spilling, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” 45 years ago Mrs. Stein told me.
"I don't think it's such a rare thing."
She continued: "I was very much helped by a woman who worked as a director, and who said that if she was angry, she was crying, but she was working on a behavioral technique, and when she was angry and started to cry, the interviewers said, "Maybe you think I'm sorry, because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are allowed in part as a way out of the amount, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first job I once cried out for inexcusable anger, and then an elderly woman grabbed me as a hostage -- a restrained mayor who always frightened me a little -- and dragged me to the stairs.
'Never let them see you in tears,' she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think thou art sad and will be glad to give thee."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Congressman-Democrat from the state of Calrad, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt came to a marriage ceremony on the eve called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder's very angry thought she could share in the presidential company herself.
"It wasn't a very well-planned solution," laughing she told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and they needed me very much.
Someone called this the "Beautiful and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been gone for quite a long time, she didn't have the funds, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election if she didn't collect $2 million.
That was a disastrous situation.
It turns out that some of her followers who sacrificed $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
'Do they think I'm going with the garbage?' she thought.
When she made a statement that she was not going to participate in the election, she was so deeply touched by the emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her -- the anger of the system that made it so difficult to get money and direction on voters rather than on candidates, and the anger of sexism -- that it took breath.
'You might think I have a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the press.
"You could think that my corporate sponsor is the producer of Kleinex paper sawmills.
I used to think they'd write on my supermotive rock?
"She cried"?
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first loopholes of trade between China and the United States were deaf, and since war is far from over, in a more far-reaching misunderstanding between countries may be for the benefit of Beijing, experts say.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, fired the first warning early this year, by charging China's main export companies, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs covered goods for a total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of the goods that occur in the United States of China.
Every time Beijing responded in the same way, rising prices from five to ten percent on U.S. goods costing 60 billion dollars.
China's allies in the United States have a symmetrical response, and the second, by the size of the economy, is hardly going to lead.
To force Washington to step back, we need to get deeper into demand, but a public tendency before the U.S. is practically unconventional for China's China leader.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the distant future can sustain China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a rigorous economic downturn is far more dangerous than the observers had previously thought," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, at the research-analytical centre of new American security.
Serial 'ready' to return refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs says
Syria says it's ready to return refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a war-torn country that lasted more than seven years.
Turning to the AAN General Assembly Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and driven economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and means of livelihood.
AAN believes more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualam said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
However, he stressed that the country would not receive help in exchange for certain conditions or help from countries that had sponsored mercenaries.
Europe has won the Cup of Riyadh in Paris
The European team won the Cup of Raidar in 2018, winning an American team of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already played the sixth time in a race on European soil and has not won the Raidar Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown even when the Dutch captain Thomas Barrow's team took 14.5 points needed to win the U.S.
The U.S. star Phil Michelson, who most of all competed for the tournaments, thrust his sword into the water for 3 pairs of 16th holes, joining this match of the French Malinari.
Italian golfer Malinari played great at all rounds, making one of the four players who went through this field with the number 5-0-0 from the beginning of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spice was scored with 5 and 4 players with the lowest ratings in the European team, Thornburn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most bat player, lost 2 and 1 Ien half of England, who probably played in his last cube of Ryder.
The veteran of the eight cubes of Riyadh Spaniard Serchia Garcia became a player who had won more than all the tournaments with a career number of 25.5 points.
'I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to return the cube.
The whole thing is on the team, and I'm glad I could help," said the startled Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the esophagus to his country to John Ram, who on Sunday lost the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods in a solo match of 2+1.
"I'm very proud of what I won at Tiger Woods, the man who had kept his career from childhood," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four mothers in France, and now my record number is 13-21-3 in Ryder's cube.
Strange statistics are one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 main titles and is left behind only by Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with it except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tney Finn, who have been playing high-class golf for the entire tournament.
The American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game to protect his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're the brigades.
This morning we showed Europe what we can do.
We've won.
Take off your hat in honour of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were playing very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the United States Golf Association and our Rhydar Cube Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat before them.
We've been played."
