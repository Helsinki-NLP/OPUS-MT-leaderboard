In China and the area, two men committed suicide
Earlier, one of the hangings had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugova, where he lived, the man of birth committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had attempted suicide before.
Which led a man to such an unknown step.
On 31 October, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a Chineseman, died at the place of residence.
No signs of forced death were found, reported the Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Moi's Chinese press service.
You got a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the sloppy road system, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that is precisely fitted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track each passing car mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize the ageing system of financing American highways undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the State.
Usually, the boring stage of road planning brought about a sudden rise in intensive debate and colourful alliances.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the Government ' s right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you have traveled and, perhaps, even where you have traveled, then use this information when drawing up tax accounts.
Cheeping movement in shock.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues relating to private life.
Although the convention cannot yet be arranged, whether or not several states are expected to meet.
They are thinking about how to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is truly necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrata, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes that Americans pay in auto repair.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase tax by even one cent at high gas prices.
“The tax on petrol is simply impossible to maintain,” said Li Mannic, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his office, 500 tracking devices were recently installed to test the payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
This is called a wrong user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since tax can change the nature of road traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California planning bodies are looking into this system as they develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the state ' s ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber ' s Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market participants in the Reason fund are also in the throes of forcing drivers to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by the two former US Transport Ministers, who in 2011 called for Congress to move towards a wrong payment.
The United States Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go this way on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles instead of gas taxes.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the involvement of trucks.
The I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how these changes can be made.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every step of their activities.
“The concern about the "great brother" and such things is a major problem," said Alaudin Khan, who is responsible for strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the United States Office of Civil Liberties in the State of Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where a difficult search for low-cost technology is carried out, which would allow the state authorities to learn about the miles of the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
She sought to enter the developing car insurance market, where drivers paid on the basis of the race.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and do not track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were some major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do this.
In Oregon, projectors experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they may give up the device entirely by deciding to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles spent by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of a careful public, making the devices do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a tax device that will also be paid by parking counters, provide “pays for driving” insurance, and collect real-time speed data pools from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid sampling.
“Automobiles will be involved in the benefits they will offer,” says the city design paper.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if not all of the wrong pay talks are just a huge determinant factor.
In the city transport commission on the San Francisco Gulf, officials said that the Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Road Construction Fund by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when everything you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in the event of economic pressure in Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan for Ukraine to secure gas and to reach agreement with IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a standby loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The Reuters analysts are doubtful that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome the long-standing differences in funding conditions.
It does not believe that the reforms needed to receive assistance can be reformed and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating on Friday to one stage by "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, a major part of which is now coming from Russia.
Maybe it'll be a gas from the North Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most acceptable and acceptable way if Russia “insulates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will probably lead to lower deliveries to other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU and Ukrainian countries on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia is not fighting for urban pollution by cars
Efforts to address the transport problems of large cities have been made in most of the world ' s megapolises since the second half of the 20th century.
It was usually about the refurbishment and expansion of roads, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and their time of use.
Singapore is a well-known example of a strict quota for private cars, and the right to purchase them is purchased in auctions.
Its price may be twice the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to enter the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are introduced where only cars with a certain class of high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a five-year clean air plan of around 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As stated by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main objective of the five-year period is to reduce air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level of not more than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and increase the use of fuel by up to 5 per cent on a single vehicle.
According to the agency, road transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the limitation of the use of motor vehicles and the introduction of additional taxes on car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the green five-year-old include an accelerated transition to the euro fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of the local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of vehicles into the city centre, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the creation of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old vehicles to hybrids or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and public service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing ' s car innovations also included a ban on the movement of all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the six of the PRC) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number mark) and the issue of registration marks for cars based on lotteries (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lotteries, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third since 2010).
According to the current 2012-2020 Environmental Protection subprogramme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to Mine Nature, in 2011 there were 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than those of industry and in St. Petersburg, nine times higher.
In the RF, there is only a beginning to think about the possibility of limiting traffic control on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the VSE, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are clearly unpopular and can only be taken by society on the basis of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - official and personal cars, as well as "privileged" users' cars, with a total of at least 200 000 (approximately 5% of the total of the Moscow car park).
In the days of urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyze the balance of urban areas between housing, road coverage and road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre provides roads twice as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the parks or just in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build a parking lot, not to expand the car store, but to reduce the passage point (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the territory of the protection zone of the historic centre (a total area of about 3212 ha covering a number of central areas of the city).
Offences for unauthorized street trade in Volgoda will grow at once
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines would help to settle in Volgoda and clear the streets of natural tents and arches.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the product they carry out is often not subject to related sanitary controls.
This means that wet people are at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade since November will be six times, from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the Vlogda Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive labour cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely dependent on consumption, which is almost non-trafficking," said chief economist Goldman Sachs of Russia Clemens Graffe, presenting yesterday's quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage increase in Russia is about 10%.
When inflation is 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies falls, so they are likely to improve staff costs.
Today we see a substantial increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP is only by 2%, Mr. Grafé explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow up, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot not raise wages, says leading economist Barclays Capital of Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for high workers.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to deceive or retain current staff.
Russia's demand for support is also fuelled by a very rapid growth in demand.
Mr. Grafé said that, owing to the extremely high rates of consumer loans, this type of lending did not have a multiplicative effect on the country ' s economy.
"The benefits for the economy from the growth of demand we have not seen, the money does not depend on the economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Graffe.
The second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is therefore a possible non-payment crisis on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of VSE Vasili Solodkov is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources of the host banks, were forced to attract high-percentage funds from the population.
In response, the host bank came out of the war and began to lower credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit institutions could not borrow under the same percentage, otherwise they would have a negative percentage margin.
If the host banks do not give up dumping, Russia is threatening the full-scale banking crisis, according to Vasili Solodkov.
The withdrawal of a number of banks' licenses in recent weeks has been regarded by the economist as a predictor of mass corruption.
"The host banks themselves will not manage the situation: the investment insurance system was not initially expected to be a systemic crisis," warns the head of the institution.
But consumption growth will be slowed down without a crisis of unpaid payments, based on the investment bank, because of the decline in the salary index of officials and military employees in the current draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reducing inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the requirement is not yet stated), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil," he says.
It is estimated that the Russian economy will begin to decline at an oil cost of less than $90 per bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
Paradoxically, inflation has declined, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This could mean they didn't believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation," Clemens Graffe said.
The Central Bank ' s interest rate policy does not affect market rates; it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the C.B., it's a failure of all hopes," Clemens Graffe said.
Money received at CB auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy but to manage their liquidity
As the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go against rubble speculation.
“In the early or late hours, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working,” said Mr. Grafe, and reminded him that the State is planning to release the rubble in the "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do this sooner or raise the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the rate of rubella is now artificially high by 10 per cent.
There's only one way I'm going to lose weight.
But if the CB is in the dark of the doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the rubble, it may break the ruble much more strongly.
The 2nd meeting of the peoples of the South Ural took place in Chelabinsk.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and regions, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies participated.
The Forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have differences and differences.
We live in full understanding of each other," says Feofan, a Chelabinsky and Zlatoustowski.
A number of issues, including the development of patriotism, were addressed during the meeting.
As a result of the move, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of national and cultural associations in the Chelabinsk area was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence investigator, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give a witness to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strfhele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my Government continues to be indifferent to the change and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that provide no protection”.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The accusations made by the United States Ministry of Justice include the spying and stealing of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister for the Interior, reported Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany was strained following allegations that the ANB had listened to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a parliamentary leader of the intelligence group, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Strfhele, a member of Parliament from the German Green Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strfägele said that, according to the lawyer of the former ANB contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden had witnessed in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there “in safety”, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a “hot and constant” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to his “political statements”.
Citizens all over the world, as well as senior officials, including in the United States, have seen the uncontrollable system of breaking up a record useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take pay for hand bet
Frontier Airlines plans to take passengers up to $100 for carrying a handhold on their journey.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 per hand deposit and $2 per coffee or gas station, although their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers would be able to leave the entire bank.
The new hand bet is spread over bags in the upper pockets, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would take $25, if the fee was paid in advance, and $100, if the travellers would pay only when they left for the landing.
The representative of the Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee should make passengers care for the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airline began to pay for the first and second baggage bags in 2008.
Passengers attempting to avoid these charges are pushing as much as they can into the upper luggage compartments as they can, so there is often no room in these compartments.
Collections are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The point is that the most loyal Frontier clients say that finding a place in the top trunk sections is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the exit of Frontier can get the opportunity to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at Frontier's registration desks was intended to guarantee that passengers would know about the collection before they got off the landing.
The new Frontier collection will not begin before the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to know that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after several years of damage.
Most of them, however, were not involved in the collection fees for hand bets.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection by hand three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, followed her example later.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said J. Sorensen, an air carrier consultant who carefully tracks the additional collection.
According to its assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection of hand-held deposits brings the Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit trip, and he was curious that he would find a way out on the landing when passengers would encounter an unusual Spirit collection for a hand bet.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I saw in my career in airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a dragon coming out on the landing.
The plane was taken, he said, “and the landing was over.
Frontier is also responsible for Spirit for payment of $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or soda can leave the whole bank and that the flow of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to deliver water free of charge.
US Airways had been trying to pay for drinks in 2008, but had given up seven months after passengers had complained and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier's hand bet-taking initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step in attracting customers to their website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has enabled all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to contact the online tourism agency.
However, the Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she started giving twice as much as a bonus to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the mile of travel.
Yes, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online tourist agency, would make it possible to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is falling and becoming fatal.
The discount was reduced by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to repair Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
ANB blames “internal error” rather than hackers for interrupting the site
The undercover National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the termination of their site had caused a technical failure for several hours, not a hacker, as the network had claimed.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planning update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that a break in work was caused by a distributed attack of the type of “service refusal” [DDoS], are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the ANB site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
Former ANB representative reported to ABC News that the agency's internal secret network had been breached.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists stated that it was responsible for removing the DDoS site from the building.
DDoS attacks have been developed in such a way that traffic is blocked until the servers are overloaded and the site exits.
Hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, a super-secret ANB, once known as “Net Such Agency”, has been at the centre of public attention and criticism in recent months following a series of disclosures about its extensive foreign and domestic landing programmes — all of this reaction to ANB's secret files stolen from the agency and published by former ANB staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to the fact that today's incident has been the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's profits are falling with the drop in delivery and number of aircraft orders
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of aeroplanes and trains, reported on Thursday that the net income had been reduced by 15 per cent, with the impact of the decrease in the number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway division.
The company Bombardier in Montreal also published no flight tests data for its new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information on whether the ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation would be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, held about half a month ago, he flew only three more times, which raised questions as to whether the test stage was on schedule.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in a decrease of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher average” to “medium average” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the reduction in air traffic flows was generally predictable, we are undoubtedly disappointed with the traffic unit’s arrival indicators,” Doerksen said in the fund market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to win its place in the lower market segment where Boeing and Airbus are now dominant.
The first experienced aircraft sample was submitted in March and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries have not yet been too much — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for summer tests to verify the company's approval of the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal in 300 firm orders until the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The test model was no longer on the ground than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the simple flight.
All manufacturers are planning different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for updates, so we did.
This will take place throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples must be carried out in the next few weeks, and the rest will be followed soon, as reported by the company.
However, analysts are sceptical about the statement that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the period of entry into service and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – supports our view that the entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending 30 September, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted stock earnings remained at 9 cents.
Gross income has decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents of stock and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The airline's order portfolio amounted to $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the avian space were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders received and the overall market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross aerospace income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ' s largest train manufacturer, reported that the sector ' s gross income rose by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The Order Portfolio in the Transport Division amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly higher than 31 December.
The transport unit ' s income has had a negative impact on the performance of several major contracts.
The management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the Chief Financial Director of Google Patrick Pichett would join the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5% to C$4.83 in the middle of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft manufacturer and nearest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction on Thursday.
Sony is counting on lower annual profits
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 have been more discouraging than expected to be related to the fall in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which brought the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter of the year, again fell to 9.3 billion yen operating losses during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially as a result of reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic, has recently put emphasis on industrial complexes: the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially through automotive systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion Ien of operating income against expected earlier 230 billion Ien.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure would be much higher and would be 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours was announced from a Japanese corporation that had a number of fashion functions that would allow it to be removed from the need for a 100 times a day to deliver a smartphone.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and profit forecast, the company's shares in the morning to open the markets in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the price, reducing to a level of 1668 yen per share.
Gen speech was a synapses education stimulant
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the School of Medicine of Mount Sinai have discovered a protein that enables Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and its summary can be read on the journal website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and who sometimes did not understand each other.
Scientists have found that family members have violated the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions perform as a stimulator for the development of new brain synapses related to speech.
He does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapses.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 is the only target of its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects the vocalization that scientists have confirmed in the mouse experiment.
When the genes were artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when they were separated with their mother.
If gene activity has been recovered, the frequency of sounds issued has also been restored.
Earlier on the mice, there was also a connection with Foxp2's own vocalization.
Animals introduced by the human copy of the gene were more active and more frequent than normal mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work is related to SRPX2's purely "mechanical" properties of sound education or more subtle processes.
A cocaine addict who warned the head of the criminal police investigation team that he was in prison
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The distinguished lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro with confidential information on the investigation of his illegal drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received the name of Bash and who was reportedly a “fine lawyer” was arrested at home in 2011 after a police operation involving Scarboro, which he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packets at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancashire, while he was at the dinner club of lawyers with colleagues.
The result was that Ditta “regularly used” Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he sought information on the arrests of two persons under the command of Scarboro and one of his associates.
All four suspects were currently under police surveillance as part of a comprehensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisiade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later in prison after the police arrested in a series of heroin and cocaine raids of £1.5 million and more than £200 thousand in cash.
42-year-old Ditta reported to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditta, who works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was humiliated after acknowledging his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of the execution of justice by a three-week court in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He admitted to cocaine storage at one of the previous trials.
The lawyer's dismissal occurred after the police investigating Scarboro discovered that he had been regularly talking to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found out how he came to Ditt's house in Blackburn and put 60 per cent of the drugs in a black pillow under the junkyards of the lawyer.
Soon after the transfer of Scarboro, he was invited to dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine discussions took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta had “regularly used” cocaine after the tests had found the traces of Class A drugs in his hair, his shirt and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took her wallet and tried to extract a few credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
In a police inquiry, he said that he had a home office, and customers came to him on legal matters.
However, it was known to the court that after major arrests, he had called the major parties to the illicit drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented in the court to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Ann White said: "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would, of course, prove to be legal because he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly exceeded the limits of the customary relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented police investigation as strongly as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't read his profession, he despised it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarboro, and allowed himself to be suspicious of his lack of interest.
Ditta did not acknowledge the guilt and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer whom I am not and wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Detta has turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he began to buy drugs from representatives of organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main actors of criminal groups who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Ditta ' s investigation led the Lancashire Unit on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been convicted of three cases of cocaine storage, and now on the prevention of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was sentenced to 14 years after he admitted his guilt in an attempt to deliver heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons involved in machining were sentenced to 153 years ' imprisonment for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers, in which he said that his dream work was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal dinner companion for him — Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for the work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslav is not ready for 22,000 spectators, police officers who were present today at the CDC meeting of the FYC noted.
In their view, the ticket programme has been overdrafted about twice.
During the match of 1/16, only a thousand stewards were involved in a nine-thousand rule.
Spartacus patients had 2,200 seats, i.e. 10 per cent of the capacity of the stadium, but, according to the Moscow Club, they had been sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was published by the head of the KDK, Arthur Grigorjanz.
The Americans listened to Japanese senior officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the American Special Services, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the States had been listening to telephone conversations by senior officials of Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several listening points in the land of the rising sun.
He noted that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence against each other.
He said that it was so during World War II when those countries were allies.
And here Japan, like Germany, in spite of allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, is the subject of intelligence, NHK reported.
This information has not yet been commented on officially by any of the parties.
Remember, news of U.S. special services for the FWG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, ANB has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some, took the report of her interrogation very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which she considered to be FWG and the United States for decades, were unacceptable to such an observer over the heads of the Government.
However, Edward Snowden said that he was ready to share details on the hearing of Angela Merkel’s telephone conversations with the staff of the German prosecutor’s office.
Germany has come to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Baschiria may exhibit grain on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014
Baschiria, during public procurement interventions, may exhibit grain on the market not earlier than early in 2014, considers the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price on the market is higher, there is a demand.
"Possible grain will be placed on the market after New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year agricultural crops had grown to 3.1 million ha in 2013, including the area of grain crops, 1.7 million ha, which was 3.3 per cent higher than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest, there are 550 000 ha (over 105,000 ha in 2012).
Increased areas under winter wheat and triticale, the rose remained at the previous level.
There is no Bratsky Circle group in the MDD database, to which Leps has been assigned in the United States
In the Russian rape database, the Bratsky Circle group, to which Washington assigned the singer Gregory Leps, is not meant.
As Interfax noted in RF law enforcement agencies, after reports of the introduction by the US Ministry of Finance of Gregory Leps to the suspect checklists of the Eurasian Bratian Crime Union, all databases have been verified, but such a group has not been found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is considered to be in force structures.
"Even in the name of 'British Circle', there is some element of secrecy, there is a sign of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a piar-action," said the agency's interviewer.
On 31 October, the United States Ministry of Finance announced the inclusion in its suspect checklists of the Eurasian criminal union, Arthur Badaljan, Gregory Lepsveridze, Wadim Lálin, Sergey Moskalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igory Schlykov.
Persons included in this list are suspected of having links with some of the Government of Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be influential members of the criminal groups and are included in the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps “serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladimir Leontyev”.
At the production center, Gregory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "the beard".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred to the Bratsky Circle as the “substantial transnational organized crime groups” and commissioned the mine to “fight and prevent their global criminal operations”.
A person ' s inclusion in the blacklists of the American Mining would involve blocking his assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with persons living in the States.
Scandal video got to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and unreasonably foolish appearances, has fallen into the habit of smoking cracks.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video recording and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he wouldn't leave his post, said CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police site.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement authorities, held a press conference on this issue.
The Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the staff with the public, but he was handled for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by the guards around the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but there had been no confirmations until recently.
No comment was made by the mayor himself.
He just says they're not guilty of anything and they're not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old Ford Alexander Lissi, accused of drug trafficking, extortion, income laundering, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lisa was the driver of Robb Ford.
The inhabitants of the city long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken fashion, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
OAO Rostovaeroinveste has recognized German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the object's projector.
The amount of the contract is not disclosed in the Rostovo-Investment.

At the first stage of the construction, the internal terminal area will be 50,000 sq.m. and will continue to increase.
According to Rostova Aeroinvesta, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
At the time of the auction, the architectural concept of the South Airline complex was defined by British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project includes the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-Na-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience of major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E "Sheremetivo International Airport" and a new airport complex at Kneviči International Airport in the Government.

Politician in Turkey proclaimed hunger against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the Nusaibin area of south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the procuring party PMD took a strong stand against construction.
The mayor on the border with Syria of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Iše Gekhan announced a hunger strike protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA News reported in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly disbanded protests.
Turkey's mid-cap Muammer Guler first rejected the fact of construction and then said that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"M. Nusaibina Iše Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death fight," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, the Kurds crossed the border freely during the half-century.
"This is an inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," Iche Hekhan quoted the party's representatives.
According to the press service, a meeting against the construction of a separation wall is planned in Nusaibina on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - Bolivia - with respect to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of United States dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s residents when they leave.
A specific dollar rate of the Bolivaire will be set at a later date.
In February Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to $6.3 billion.
However, in the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bollivars.
Since the beginning of the year, almost 70 per cent of its value has been lost.
In September, inflation in Venezuela accounted for almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of the Oil Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
However, according to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may decide to reduce the national currency rate after the December municipal elections.
The policy of withholding the prices of products and goods of widespread consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to the shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of Jury Andrey Belmach noted that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new coach.
This post has become vacant following the resignation of Sergei Schepelev.
Retirement took place just hours ago, so tell me how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, ITAR-TASS brings Belmach's words.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, but a man who works at our club for a few years and gets some results.
Kenyan Press Reproached by the Provocative Media Act
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason for the question: what could prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which is one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new judicial body on the media “will always be passionate because it is a continuation of the Government” and that the restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya ' s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the Members,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law would essentially allow the government to “take the media with the dead,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “had a serious impact”, and criticised the bill as “drakonow”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where the troops that were sent to the scene of the attack were supposed to rob a road trade centre.
David Kimayo, the chief of police, responded to a call from two journalists and a media officer for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, the issue could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists, up to one million with an additional risk of being “exclusion from lists”, that is, denied official journalism accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ' s so-called "relived blogosphere " .
Politicians understand that by making the media shut up, they will be able to do everything they think they can without punishment.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote the journalist Nation Mutum Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balancing forces in public life.
“The policies presented themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were a target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of reductions imposed by the National Wages Commission and the restoration of their huge wage of about 532 thousand shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of costs will be available in the public payroll of the hostages, which will be charged to the capital repair of the home.
It is estimated that between 100 and 400 rubles per month will have to be added to the standard two-room apartment from the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the exact rules.
So when you decorate the trip, get the walkers in order, or even replace the elevator, the residents will decide for themselves.
This law has been approved by the deputies of the area.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, president of the Vronez Regional Order, said: "In this case, it is also necessary to lay down the order of the caper assembly of houses, to accumulate funds in non-governmental companies, which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-quarter houses."
Under the control of the State now and the construction on the left.
The law that protects against fraud is approved by the swindler in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, four and a half thousand people have been affected by corrupt offenders.
Most of the problems have been solved.
The new law provides for the rights and responsibilities of all parties to the partial construction.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Vronez Regional Order, said: “It is not a secret that abuses in this area have also been committed in relation to the fact that in the year 98 there have been the same abuses, and in the year 2000 there have been the same abuses.”
People started working on it to cover the lasagna, including the two laws.
Under Vronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The Regional Parliament passed such a law not only under the coercive federation.
At the same time, remove the problem of illegal migrants in the region.
Yes, over 100,000 foreigners were heard last year on the migration account.
But only every fifth of them issued an official work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Vronez Regional Order, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The courts don't have to be deported, they have to be held somewhere.
Such a decision was made by the Federation that regional means of equipping such sites.
In the Vronez region, such a place is the Old Olshank of the Semilucian region.
Finally, the regional Parliament has granted new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families where 5 and more children are raised are fully exempt from the transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million -- but so many parents are also saving.
Secondly, and this is mainly the case, those who adopt the 3rd and younger will be granting housing grants from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at the price of 30,000 per metre.
The family, for example, of 6 people, was a father, a mother, a child, and a third were adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square metres, of 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West micro-region, the option is quite acceptable.
Well, at the mall, you can buy a whole cottage.

U.S. Secretary of State: special services sometimes “were too far away” when collecting data
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, when collecting data and hearings, American special services sometimes “were too far away”, however, politicians noted that the media's intelligence of 70 million people did not match.
I assure you that innocent people did not get hurt during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was wrong.
I recognize that, as the President also acknowledges... and we will monitor that this does not happen in the future," the AFP Secretary-General quoted.
Italian workers with train leave the way for young people
The Italian unemployment rate is high.
The data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population is now out of work.
So bad things haven't happened since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for intern workers.
On the other hand, Italy is expecting a common problem for Europe for the elderly.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of personnel justifies itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport-resistance units (TSPs).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPFs.
Our correspondent understood what the project was about.
A few months ago, a construction project was launched at the Smolensko Arbatsko-Pokrovski Metro.
The sign said there was a transport peresading bridge.
It was all very strange, because no land transport was stopped near the Smolens, and therefore it could not be moved.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sado ring, you have to cross some 130 meters, including the land crossing through the Carmanic Wayway.
We're almost done with Smolens now.
There was a flowering lare, a paper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a brush before the entrance.
That's the whole transport facility.
The transport-prefabricated nodes are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
There are no capital units yet.
And the flats involve the construction of parks, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and the construction of buildings.
In fact, flat TPPs are not even engaged in transport, but professional construction workers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport network is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Michael Blinkin High School of Economics.
Sometimes there are enough roofs on the head and board warning of the arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-fledged flat replanting plant.
Let it go with no hangovers, but with catcher parks and a signboard when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of the number of officers, everything is recorded in the WFP.
In 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 of them, 59 of them with capital.
The plans by 2020 now amount to up to 255 GSTs.
Half of them promise to give up this year.
Although there is no quality criteria for the development of WFP in the city, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the City and Transport public organization, notes.
Counted by the number of facilities, but the quality of the replanting on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: firstly, reduction in the time of replanting, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without rain.
In Moscow, on the other hand, when the TPU is set up, the opposite is the case.
It's a good example of the VDNH subway.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslava Shosse were in a quagmire before the main entrance to the VVC.
Their stops were now transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslava to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far from the monopoly, so close to home.
Because the residents didn't really want the car park under the windows and complained at all possible instances.
The capital war in Moscow wasn't done right away.
The first of them started building five years ago at Plannerna Metro.
The project was designed to be a model.
And there has indeed been a pattern of how the transplant plant dedicated to the purchase of investors has become a banal mall.
No, there's a lot of buses here, a lot to keep you from getting off the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
It is true that the German trolleybus No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPP did not give place in principle.
They've been taken away from the subway like strangers.
That's why there's more trading space.
There are only 32 shops, and there are almost everything from zoos to car salons.
Actually, which one of the passengers on the bus would need to buy a new car in the road?
When we build a capital TP, why is there always a trade center?
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when a part of the truck decided to market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU Plannerna, fighting trade is taking place among those listed in the parking lot.
Fruits, spices, Chinese gins, Russian speech and guards who look at our photographer badly.
The transplant was finally turned into a market.
The thing is, before the "Planner" subway, it was a market, but it was taken off.
And in the prefecture of the merchants, they regrettably let them into the catchment area of the replanting plant.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was put down to build a new flat-screen TV.
That's the rocking.
The Kalužski metro distance from the west of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, the TPP claimed that the distance had increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the shopping mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, it's going to be under the open sky.
However, the structures at Plannerna and Kalužska will soon be displayed with flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Mary adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of these will be 25 floors, regardless of the two or three subterranean jars.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino Metro, with 418.7,000 square meters of space.
Representatives of the RJD Railway Stations Directorate responsible for the construction of the metro TPU have already told reporters that future multi-storey shops, hotels and apartments will be in place.
Officials are sure that the multi-story parking lot is up from one third to one half of the area.
Take for example the "national" garages.
For example, the 258 car park, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 sq.m.
So for the parking lot for 2.6 thousand cars, Petrovsko-Razumovski will need about 80,000 squares.
It's less than a third of the machine they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go on every bus perforation.
It remains at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property.
And this, for a minute, is almost two guma.
If the capital of TPPs were to be built by railway stations and trains, the rest of the sites would be occupied by the metropolis.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
According to the Moscow City Property Department, journalists have recently been informed that they are drafting a draft regulation that enables investors to contact officers directly for a TPS site.
No competitions.
Therefore, pray that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Garward station in Boston or Spadina in Toronto, and Alexander Morozov is sure.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the subway and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres without leaving the street.
No more trade.
But the Moscow officials are in extreme danger.
Either we're not building anything or we're already tearing down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare the extreme insult to patriotic feelings
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults directed against Russia, the Justice of Russia proposes to compare the patriotic feelings with the extremist activities and punish them for five years in prison.
As reported in the Newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by Oleg Mikheev's Energy Committee are already being sent to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of the person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, by a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal signs of State authority - flag and flag.
However, in the opinion of the parliamentary, the protection of the Russians, whose feelings may be affected and the insult of public symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, has not been sufficiently addressed in Russian law.
As an example, he introduced a growing annual debate into the canon of Victory Day, when some media characters allowed themselves to question the heroic incitement of the people of the USSR to fight against the Fascists.
Next to the main national festival - Victory Day, May 9th - the present Vakhanalia is being held annually.
While exercising in an instrument and "alternative view" of history, some publicists argue that, unfortunately, the Germans did not win the Soviet Union!
I find this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual strength" of the nation," says Oleg Mikheev.
Furthermore, according to Micah, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law penalizes believers for insulting their feelings and the patriotic feelings can be almost without punishment.
In the opinion of the people ' s elector, it is necessary to compare patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to impose appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for a penalty for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousand fine to a five-year sentence.
The quake of the magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo area of central Chile, the agency Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, which is set out on the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The logs were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November to Moscow).
Victims or subterranean destructions have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of different forces are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
The 8.8 earthquake and tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, there was the most powerful earthquake in Chile in recent history: a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there in 1960.
More than five thousand people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be handled in compliance with the legislation, and we will hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Ero.
Among the detainees, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanu, like the other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," says Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one can violate the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any structure that was trying to influence technologically complex and dangerous processes, including energy generation, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like a powder bottle” and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting “RIA News”.
UN proclaims new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately start working on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of the " Sustainable Development Goals" for the MDGs, which expires in 2015, until the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro the next evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, at the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Pan Ki-moon, told the summit before evening that the time had now come for “to become superior to national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals,” he said.
These CDMs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by Member States to incorporate our vision of sustainable development goals based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concern about security in Mozambique increases as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the statue of Samora Mashel, the President-in-Office of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scandalize the peace slogans on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Suss, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business costume to a football that was decorated with the title “We Require Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital of the Independence Square.
Within two weeks, almost every day, reports of clashes between government forces and Renom have been received — one of the most cruel clashes since the reconciliation more than 20 years ago.
Renom once was a well-known rebel movement supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa during the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the peace of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country will soon face a full-scale conflict again, but recent developments have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
High rates for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge greenhouse gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renomo party have been accusing each other of the tension.
The Renom Party argues that the Government has become the closing point for recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional area of Renom, on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked the Renomous bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group's leader, reported Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renom.
The Government blames Renomo for launching the clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armandu Gebuz has tried to break down the concerns about instability.
Gebuza told the French information agency that on Wednesday, Mr. Dhlakam felt “successful” who wanted to use “everything left by his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renomo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reporting that Mazanga had declared Renoma ' s refusal of the 1992 peace agreement.
He reported on the Financial Times, which meant non-compliance with the Frelimo Agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,” Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension, which has increased the number of clashes this year.
“These two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have fallen in love,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renom Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of votes for Renom has declined since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), founded by the former Renomist, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuz, who had to leave the post the following year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multiparty democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace, because he doesn’t want to leave the president’s office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what possibilities Renom has, but it has already carried out devastating and deliberate attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading north to the south.
Most of the contact was made in the province of Sofala, which is hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but includes Beirut — a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using railways about a week after Renom was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was relieved when he was asked whether Renom would repeat this threat.
The Renom Party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique”, Mazanga said.
Instigated by the Government's dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the future of the country is the responsibility of the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a part of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares Renomo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The Art Mainstream premiere series will take place in Moscow
The Art Mainstream series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films within a few days of their release, will take place at the Rollan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
Opens the "Art-mainstream" programme of French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any price."
It's a story about a Maye model working in the French capital (Sama Kerichi), which is deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also show a new picture of the renowned South Korean director Kim Ki Duk "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cana Film Festival "Vizn Adel" Abdelatit Cash.
The only Russian participant, Art Mainstream, will be the winner of Alexander Veledin's Geographer's Glöbus Propil at the film "Kinotaur" festival, based on the motto of the novel Alexei Ivanov.
Konstantin Habenski, whose work was also marked by the Kinotovar Prize, played a key role in the film.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of life”, says the author.
The Torah statements could show that “the harsh force cannot defeat the ingenious cunning”, and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking of the fact that many myths would prove “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too bad for teaching in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates the “enormous selection” of appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education,” he said.
I voted in favour of introducing them to the training programme for twenty years.
He added that “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “interested” in children and the main ideas “supplied” in attractive stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-Saxon language, and wrote the Norwegian Myths Collection for Penguin and the British People's Stories, said: "You can of course have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps a major difference between an adult author for adults and an adult author for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that it is necessary to have a sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Vronez area, a football fan has been detained, breaking the window into the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening, on 29 October, two Moscow-based football fans were taken off the passenger train.
After going to the game of the favorite team, the guys set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police station at the police station to establish an administrative offence protocol.
There the fanatics were embittered by their anti-social behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and released.
Young people bought tickets for the next train, and the train station was waiting for its arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly came back and broke the window of the front door into the waiting room of the station.
A transport police officer and C.P.P.R.D. officer were hit by a broken glass phone.
They were able to arrest an intruder trying to hide from the scene.
Russia's South-East LLU staff are being audited.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case has been reported by the senior reference to the information and public relations of the Russian Ministry of South-East LU on the transport of Sergey Olhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the tribunals during the Russian Cup Shinnik match, Spartacus.
I'm in charge of all of this by sports event organizers: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see something they've taken hold of.
They're waiting for someone on the side to come in order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
You have to organize the patients, the clubs should invite your stewards, not let the case go to the driveway.
We have now developed a special government rule on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will address this issue in full.
But I will still have to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
It's such a feeling that the Bavarian patients came to Yaroslav and built it all.
We're strange observers.
And it's awful to see the tribune blow out of the brandpoint.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we came back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Sickness can be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. Special Service Officer Edward Snowden will probably not leave Russia to give evidence of the phone negotiations of the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.
As Interfax said on Friday, a well known to the situation, the American can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in public in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure outside Russia is practically off.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be issued to Washington by U.S. allies," said the agency's interviewer.
“However, in principle, the FRG's Office could send its representatives to RF or transfer written questions to Snowden,” added the source, adding that the matter should be processed at the inter-State level.
Former German Ambassador Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify on the case of a hearing of the U.S. special negotiating services of the Chancellor of Germany.
Snouden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
A former CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S.A. has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Advocate Snouden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the Interfax source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who was working with the U.S. National Security Agency (NAB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then reported on U.S. security security operations online.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but couldn't leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities who had made serious accusations to him and remained in Sheremetevo airport before the beginning of August.
On the first August, Snowden received a temporary asylum document in the territory of Russia for one year and left Sheremiteevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client was set up to work in a large Russian company.
Last week, German media reported an A.N.B.B.A. for Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the U.S. Chancellor's telephone negotiations began to be heard in 2002.
The follow-up station was reportedly in the United States Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that Merkel ' s plot violated Germany ' s laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarrev left "Just Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirske Ilia Ponomirrev, a member of the State Court of Justice of Russia, made a statement on leaving the political organization.
As the parliamentarian said, he made a statement at the New Sibirian regional office of the party.
According to her statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev left a number of "justices".
We'll sit down and have some tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilia Ponomarrev put on the table," but there is nothing so epochical about it," the MP commented.
Ponomirev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional office of the Esseros.
However, Mr. Ilia Ponomarrev ' s mandate was not intended to be rejected.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the party and could not, by law, leave it.
The announcements of Ili Ponomarreva's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would leave with him, but the latter soon rejected this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the question of the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDI, Fumio Kisida, met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrovi, to discuss issues relating to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to exchange views on further development of political dialogue, discuss the issues of the conclusion of a peace treaty,” said the meeting of Kisida.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sindzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries became warmer and more bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would go to Japan to address complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies decisions on the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In that regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
There are cars on the Japanese capital, from which the speaker says, "Return the north territories!"
The police don't stop protesting, they're watching for noise levels to go up.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, Estrad artist Frank Fay, a lecturer at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
In time, the renovation of the Féia was picked up by others, just recently the New York Comedy Festival.
The established and curated Caroline Hersh, founder of the Carolines Club stand, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, including more than sixty shows in small clubs and major theatres.
“Most of these hedliners started in Carolines, and then they made more success, reached the level when they were already too famous to play at the club,” Hersh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Hero Stand" – an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstin, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear.
As the festival expanded, so did the comedy world.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have acquired popularity in a non-traditional way, for example through a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was known for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable channel (particularly the FXX League on fantasy football) and now runs his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Sladet entered the playhouse both on Saturday night in the direct atmosphere and on the park and rest area, although she was best known for the series of virus rolls called "Marcel - Botanic Raccoon".
And Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a self-styled style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a vicious, racially focused comedy, Kamau Bell), is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standup comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal historical comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the leader of a TV country show called Sit Down Comedy and David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central element of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, sometimes he was walking around somewhere between the two houses, thinking, "If I'm out of money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have started negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the Embassy of the United Kingdom, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Navaz Sharif, was visiting.
The Head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Niko Clegg, with whom he discussed relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reform in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister has reported that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun,” says a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added the diplomats.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a unanimous Afghan movement, but they operate independently in the north-western areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
In the past, the Islamic Government had tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities took the troops permanently located in the areas where the Taliban were operating and released from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London discussing prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil dropped to $96 per barrel.
The price for oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about large stocks had become cloudy, indicating that China ' s energy-intensive production sector was gaining its strength.
The U.S. oil base in the December supply dropped by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later this morning in electronic stores on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall of 5.8 per cent in October.
Rich oil stocks have influenced its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels per week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports on the Chinese industry, which showed that its activity was under way.
This indicates that China ' s recovery may continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter has risen to 7.8 per cent after a minimum of twenty years in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, the world's leading oil class, also used by U.S. oil processing companies, was 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Stock Exchange in London.
The main coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, who explained the decision to release the first minute of Sémen Varlamov's helicopter in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night of the chain had not shaken his confidence in Russian, handed off the "SE" contest from Dallas to Natalia Schmelev.
And what we're waiting for, Rua said after the morning break of Lavin.
Of course, all of us are concerned, but we are confident that it will be useful for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go up to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't say anything about the door conditions?
I'll see you today.
Our players will undoubtedly support Varley in helping him to keep the door, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
Mainly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia, there's no need to be a giant: a warm tomato won't replace a mushroom
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent for the RIA News found.
People who have completely refused products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
They don't carry winter without losing their health, and no hot tomatoes compensate for them, they are considered by novelist dietologists and doctors before Vegan's Day.
Drinking oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, when not only of meat and fish but also of milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, strict nutrition standards are at least inappropriate for health.
The complete abandonment of animal products is damaged.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," said a dietitologist, Marina God.
It provides an example of fish containing the irreplaceable fatty acid of Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is lignite.
"In order to need it in the quantity needed for a man, you have to drink it in litres!" says a dietologist.
Doctors are confident that the inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to the winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly dubious in this season.
In our realities, there are high requirements for food.
To avoid freezing, high calories are needed.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, he or she does not get that calorie,” says a specialist.
This is what the dietitologist Olga Poznjak agrees with.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit are not an exit.
It is better to feed primarily on products grown in the region of residence or where they were born.
The genetic code is aimed at better adoption and overhaul of these products.
And the winter people don't want to bite a gourmet, but a hot sock or something else," explains their doctor.
According to her, there may be veganos, which are actually useful for various weeds, crustaceans, beans, local plants, apples left in the winter, frozen strawberries.
But that is clearly not enough for full - time nutrition.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulin, the levels of vitamins in the organisms are sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetation in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow is unintended.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, above all, fat," says a doctor.
Doctors point out that fornication is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And in keeping with vegetarianism, we give them to the underprivileged.
They also require increased protein, vitamins and micro-elements in the menu.
"The vegans don't get them," God is sure.
Arifulin says that an adult is willing to choose anything, "play in the games he wants."
He's got an already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
And children still need to be fed properly.
If parents leave him some micro-elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will be, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substance to develop the brain, the look, the bones will no longer recover tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals surveyed are of the opinion that the quality of winter is low in greenhouses and fruit and vegetables.
What is brought to us and what is grown in the greenhouses contains less of the micro-elements we need than what is grown in the open soil.
"The quality of the products isn't that," God says.
Arifulin also notes that imported and warm fruits and vegetables are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to harvest more crops is damaging to quality.
"The apples don't get brown on the grid, the ants quickly yellow and dance, the tomatoes tasteless and unflavourable," he adds, adding that they are probably too many spices.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not in agreement with the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agricultural Problems, the candidate for rural science of Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the greenhouses, it was possible to produce fully-fledged plants.
If they try to get out of the square metre, they will, of course, be more frequent and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are big, but waterproof and not sweet," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the enforcement of a decision on “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the New York Police Department ' s stop-and-search programme and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. District Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Shandlin ' s decisions would be suspended until the results of the city ' s appeal were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the constitution in implementing the street arrest and interrogation programme.
The city complained about its decision and decisions on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police office in changing the practice of the work and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on the request for a suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated the need for a judge to be removed because it violated the U.S. judge code of conduct and did not consider the need to avoid demonstrations of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, innocently addressing black and Latin Americans on the “stop-and-search” programme.
She had appointed an external monitor for monitoring major changes, which included policy, training and control reforms, and had decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras installed on television in police stations where most detentions were taking place.
In August New York, a decision was made to terminate the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been terminated after police verification.
The city's appeal debate should take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
“Research facility” has been in place for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased sharply under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective suit.
Parties to the New York Department of Police “stop-and-search” programme say that these changes will end mistrustful practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other police departments implement this practice.
The proponents argue that the changes will reduce the military spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money loss, and not solve a more global problem of complex police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers for several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was in line with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone has been opened in the area of the Tritiakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretijakov Gallery and is located two kilometres from Novokuznečka Metro Station to the Bolot Square.
Street torchs, flower shops, chimneys, urns and toilets have been set up throughout the period, and there have been noise and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentov and Lavrushin crossings, which were already pedestrians, five streets - the Ordinian Tupic, the Major and the Little Tolmachev crossings, the Cadeshev Coastal and Boltow Square were closed for cars.
The transport movement on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On Friday street from the western station "Novokuznečka" to the Klimentov Pass, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing the movement and cutting the passage of the part, transmitted newsmsk.com.
Within the pedestrian zone were the Trinitarian Gallery, the Temple of the Priest of the Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, the Tverski Pass, the Crossroads and the Kuznečki Bridge had become completely pedestrians.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to shut down the exit and holiday cars.
Coulson turned to the phone to check the confidential communication
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used “the telephone break, the foothold and the resistance” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer Andrew Edys, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005 the newspaper News of the World had received an uncertain news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive Special Adviser” Hanny Polby.
The newspaper ordered Private Detective Glenn Mulkayer to break up the voicemail of Polby and warn her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left the voicemail, the court heard.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person who will be standing next to someone’s house hoping to be broken up, the man who likes to invite history to see what they say,” said Eddie.
He said that the News of the World used three ways of investigating history: telephone break-up, foot-and-mouthing and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the note, he just has to.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone break?
He says no, but we say, 'Yes indeed.'
Listening to the novel Clarke for the first time drew attention to the news of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, “No time is wasted, she is with Charles.”
The voicemail tape received at least three times from her phone was taken from Mulkair ' s house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private detective's computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister were depicted as “Projects”.
During her period under the circumstances, Ms. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information on her, Mr. Edys said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would like to discuss with Charles very much.”
Mr. Edys said that Coulson's participation in this story was on the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about a novel with a married woman while he himself met Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks are refusing to enter into an agreement with other people in order to break telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbeck and Wezerap have been admitted to a phone breakup.
Snowden says he is willing to communicate with the FWG authorities in the case of interrogation
A former CIA employee, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so and to meet with the FWG authorities, RIA News.
A letter from the former CIA official to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was presented on Friday by a deputy of the Protestant Hans Christian Strebele, through which Snowden transmitted the message to the German authorities.
Srübele met Snowden before in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of a street fire
As a result of the burning in the collector's centre of Moscow, on Tverska Street, four people were injured.
As Interfax reported with reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby were injured during the fire in a deep underground passage.
According to the RIA News, referring to the head of the Pavl Livinski's fuel and energy department, electricity is now fully restored in all the houses on Tverska Street.
A fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on Tverska Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the sewage canals, and there was a suffocation in the underground passage at the Armenian store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were left on Tverska Street.
At 21:45 a.m., the fire was extinguished.
United States dollars cut food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of product talents known as “Food stamps” is reduced as the State programme in question ends.
For the food allowance, the four-person family will now be allocated $36 per month less than previously, officials say.
This will affect 47 million poorer Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012, an average per person was $133 per month.
Food aid in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued under “Food stamps” that have been named since they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate growth and help the poorer Americans.
However, Congressional Republicans are required to further reduce the programme ' s resources, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more.
Food store owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
Congressmen in the United States continue to argue as much as possible about reducing the funding of the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
Blizzard's studio released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge.
This is what WoW Insider reports.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts are part of the American service can now jump.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
On one occasion, dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death and sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight against Sarlak's supporters and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game the studio released after its rename to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money but for meetings.
A 30 ruble-cost trip will be for a potential passenger in 30 sessions.
The number of meetings will be calculated by means of modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the Russian Olympic Committee ' s press service.
The first equipment will be installed at the Station “Extation” on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Jukov, and the Olympic Gymnasists Alexis Nemov and Elena Zamolodčikov, will welcome.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security reinforces the flagship of public opinion
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low above the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the roof of the United States representation building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media said that BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions resulted in negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of the U.S. National Intelligence, in September again assured us that the U.S. is not using the external intelligence “to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies for American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who became a dissident, began publishing his U.S. intelligence treasure, the European governments and company leaders are no longer convinced whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has monitored the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and has been given access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, to new heights.
The last drop was reported to have been heard by Chancellor Angela Merkel for perhaps ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can be a target, then of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made clear intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think this data is probably used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up”, says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY Advisory Agency.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the United States had transferred commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and the Internet and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we need to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software supplier company SAP.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spying agencies, which have become famous for Snowden's discoveries, have been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China was the biggest risk of such a decline.
More progress is being made in cloud technology, where European company managers have better understood that the data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use US-based cloud-supply services after the release of an American programme for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that didn’t occur a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest communications are merely confirmation that they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at any price.
What is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“It has been discussed for many years and has not changed significantly in the current dispute,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to be caught up in the responses they have taken, as this can give the enemy an advantage.
In large companies, it has long been thought that taking a free flashlight on the show or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel’s number is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of Audi’s Board of Directors, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they can not be used as hearing aids.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is a fear that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to fractures and seizures.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns the BfV report.
The United States of America has warned its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Survey put France and Russia and Israel together in a second series of offenders who were hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French “are worse for everyone”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services know very well that all countries, even when working together to combat terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a youth from Georgia who died in a “disgusting accident” believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia whose body was found inside the back of a sports mat in his high school gym believe that their son was killed, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical matt lying behind the benches in his high school gym.
London County Sheriff's investigators have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family contests it.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff says.
“They believe it is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, as well as to a healthy sense,” Kramp said.
They believe that it is a cover for the protection of people or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and brought him back to them with a body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts wherever they come from.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I take the view that there are sufficient grounds” for formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second revelation, said Moore, indicated another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to carry it out.
A representative of the Sheriff-General of the County of Loundes was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video surveillance cameras that were being watched by the investigators.
A teenager’s parents said that they hoped that the videos contained a key to the idea of how he died.
Spartacus: For information on the persons who hung the Fascist symbol
A statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of the Fascist flag in Yaroslava appeared on the official website of Sparta.
On October 30th, the famous provocatives at the stadium in Yaroslave demonstrated a fascist symbol.
We are addressing all those who have reliable information about those who have committed this crime, with the request to provide it with
"Remuneration is guaranteed," says the statement.

Remember, in the 1/16th match, the Russian Cup Shinnik, Spartacus, was interrupted several times by riots in the tribunals.
A Fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus patient sector.
In the form of Spartacus punishment, there may be about three games without the spectators.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information about the person who passed and hung this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for children's allergy schools
In the area of control and disease prevention, the list of recommendations on control of food allergies in children in schools has been published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school children suffering from food allergy is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
Disease control and prevention centres found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and child-care professionals about food allergy and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — the most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — in order to assist in potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with minor difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something is going on in my language," "It feels like I have hair on my tongue" or "the tongue of a squire."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “unspecified sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external sex organs of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer be forced to assign male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to identify sex as “undetermined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the transfer of the sex of the newborn and to prevent discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I am not a man or a woman”.
I'm going to be a trained doctor with a pair of blues and scarves.
Approximately one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed as “sex violations” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (eggs or seedlings) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most U.S. experts say that if sex cannot be identified, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it to it than to expect and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the surgery, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as being different from transsexuals or transgenders, since their status relates not to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female, but is typical for both of them at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be seen in secondary sexual signs such as muscle mass, the distribution of hair cover, chest and body mass; primary sexual signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of prejudice, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already authorized adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, was the first person in the world to be recognized as “unsuitable” and to remain “undetermined” sex for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still in conflict, according to a news release on France channel 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strong Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have sex with children at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child”, she said to her parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, on behalf of the beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community adopted a gender as a letter that could be deleted and then redesigned.
But now many are questioning the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and that doctors sometimes make a bad choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century it was called an emergency psychiatric case”, Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you did call a surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with intermediate genitals was suggested by Dr. John Manny of John Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals, such as how parents are growing up, interacted with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a man would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a non-slip cutting, totally castrated the child, also removed his eggs, and raised him as a girl.
“I presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it wasn’t,” Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still applying this model.
But in the 1990s, with Internet revenue, people who survived these sex-exchange operations declared themselves “unsatisfied”.
That was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but with intermediate type genitals.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large clit or a small penis, and he was convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external sex organ and eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was assigned a vaginal plastic.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and nobody ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Upon learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone’s condition and removing his chest.
The operation made it fruitless.
Today, he advocates the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people into line with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “promotes the insertion of labels and origins”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child “unspecified sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will promote intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen this law show up yet, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices for the third sex”.
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions on formal sexuality,” she said.
The German law means that it is assigned at birth.
This is a fight that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, an X-rayist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
Barac's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “androgen complete insensitivity syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are working incorrectly, Katie has developed female signs.
She's got a pot, but she doesn't have a mother and an egg.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is in charge of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own”, said Barac.
He gives them time to do some analysis and to deal with the situation, as well as the interval of time before they write “male” or “female”.
If so, you are likely to grow up, love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you have joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that moves parents because they do not feel what they are doing right,” she said.
At the end of the day, the child will decide with which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This allows children to decide on their own.
Chicago gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands what should be playing better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin first missed six shots from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth shot.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't do it, CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in the trainings, I think it's time to approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on those shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite comfortable.
But then, after a few heads, everything turns into a snowy coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Gatekeepers don't think I'm the only one that's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in the mood.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so that I don't miss so many clues.
It's good that my teammates support it, but in principle it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
There was a bus on Altay.
A PAZ bus has been converted to the Rubcow district of the Altai Region.
As a result of the DTP, 13 people were reported to the regional HRC.
Previous law enforcement bodies in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the department, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. at the local time on the Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka motorway, 1 km from Novonikolaevka.
The bus followed from Rubcovska to Višnevka had 12 passengers and a driver, all were injured in various degrees of severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the City Hospital No. 1 Rubcovska, two people were hospitalized at the Rubcovska CIA.
Medvedev estimates that SSJ-100 will be deployed to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 to be placed in Europe once it has been placed on the markets of Latin America and Asia.
"We expect, in general, that we will receive more than 170 aircraft of this type," says Interfax, Prime Minister of Russia Dmitria Medvedev, who told them at a press conference with Prime Minister Jean Mark Eiro.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that, once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be placed in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Souch Civil Aviation Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed using modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in 100 passenger seats.
Dneproperty's energy began a unique rescue program...
In an old age to lead to the court of the aisles, the villagers on the high hill set up a telegas wheel, and the heavy nest was well on it.
Such special resistances have long been lost, so the atheists have loved the pillars of the electric transmission line - the interlocked seals are built on the wire, which makes the real home sound.
Anna’s grandmother, who has lived in the village of Ivanovska Petríkov, has been living with a real family for 20 years, has noticed the nest’s nest despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new vetches on top, and the lower layer is already in the middle of the wires, and that's where it's going to go.
Of course, it is a pity that the family of Aistas, who nested in the yard every year, took out and fed three or four birds in the summer, but did not want to miss the light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmest part of the country, Grandma Anja called the Royal RESS, which has the support.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, said technical director of the DTEC "Dneproblenergo" Sergei Berezovski.
In fact, in a nest of between 150 and 200 pounds [150 and 200 kg], corrosion began to occur.
At any time, the birds could have been killed by the electric power station.
Yes, local residents were at risk of losing their light due to damage to the pipelines.
Therefore, linear monters have begun a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Science ornithologists from the Dneproperv National University have assisted in the development of a nest transport scheme.
They did training for district network staff.
A well-known dne-propert ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, consulted energy engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For the first time, it was estimated that there were more than 50 aristocrats in the area of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were installed to remind the raven.
The foundation was laid by the oak trees, and then the old nest was moved.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old seals as a basis for birds to find and return to nest.
After that, the atheists will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Pesčanka in the Novomosk area.
A series of electric brakes were put on a new iron bar and placed on it a platform with an old nest already in place.
The entire operation was carried out by energy at nine thousand griffins.
During the day, the same new village took place in the village of Ivanovka Petríkov region in the grandmother Ani’s courtyard.
Here the platform was fixed in the former place, just hanging over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice the spring that their “quarter” has been repaired.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrov and the Carinthian areas of the Dneproperty.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others are unfortunately killed.
During the day, the whole area was filled with sad news -- in the village of Ust-Kamenk Apostolovsk, on the day of the opening of the hunt for the pheasants, the marriage partners shot down a tiny family living in a local stream for entertainment.
The blessed birds were not afraid of the people; the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they fled to the river, and the four beekeepers were already dead on the water.
The officers of the Apostolic Paradise of the militia now find out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian March" becomes more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be held in agreement with the Russian March.
According to a survey by Levada Centre, support for the Russian marches is growing - 40 per cent of citizens have already supported the idea of doing so to a different extent.
According to Levada-Central, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals for the Russian marches, 11 per cent of which are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “s rather positive”.
The popularity of the Russian marches gradually increased - in 2006 only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010, such activities supported two more citizens (28 per cent).
"Definedly negative" to "Russian Marches" is only 7% of Russians, "almost negative" is 19%.
35 per cent had not yet been able to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, the Moscow Mary agreed to hold the Russian March with up to 15,000 people in Ljublin, which is reported today by the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist action is taking place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Did you hear that on 4 November Russian marches were held under the slogans of the protection of Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Only one fifth of Russians (20 per cent) now know about this action.
Significantly, in December 2010, almost three citizens (31%) were heard about the Russian marches.
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural nationalist meeting took place in Maneja Square.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who knew the right answer (People's Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
About the same amount (17 per cent) is planned to celebrate the 7 November October Revolution.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the Moscow Mary agreed on "Russian March" in Ljubljana
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the sixth in Ljubljana on the Day of People's Unity, there will be a meeting and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group, also in agreement with the authorities.
How the Russian March 2012 went
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, nationalists passed the sixth from the James Coast to the Central House of the artist where the meeting took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20,000, the IMF called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama's pre-election headquarters considered Bayden's exception to Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton's 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation from all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Heilemmann about the 2012 campaign “The Posts Double: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the president's closest assistants had conducted “wide-ranging research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Bayden's exclusion could help raise the deadlocks of Obama's re-election.
According to political observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the efforts of senior election officers and the White House, namely the former head of the White House, Bill Daily, to assess the effect that the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President would have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret carefully guarded in the Chicago Pre-election Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama’s pre-election headquarters Jim Messin and former senior counsellors of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Posts Double claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “close personal relationship”, but finally declined this step when their data showed that Clinton’s addition to the electoral list would not “improve Obama’s chances significantly”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I actively spoke for a lot of things, and it was one of them,” Daley said.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary check”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election staff had made enough efforts to examine whether the dividend would result in a vote.
“The pre-election headquarters will not spend such amounts on surveys and focus groups if they do not consider anything serious,” Martin said in the AC 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his old boss about a possible hit.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President “was in the course” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration acknowledged that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that the Double Rates did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensitization had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he was serious that Obama did not know about the possibility of deleting Baiden from the electoral list.
“Possible,” Martin replied.
Do you want the light shining in the darkness of the cold?
The British entrepreneur created the first in the world to be frozen in the dark with honey.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea by reading the scientific article on bears, and convinced scientists in China to re-establish a bright white.
The frozen person reacts with the language of the person eating it, increasing the pH in the protein and causing it to light.
Chris says that since the frozen starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, that means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice-cream production company "Lice Me, I'm delicious," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning of production, so for £200 you will get about 2 g of substance."
The protein that we use in ice cream comes into reaction with your language at neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase your pH and start to light up.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed that it would be perfect to present it in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable light effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream of what I've done because the bear's luminescence is four times the value of gold.
So every scar is worth me about £140.
That's why it's nice enough to taste.
The experimental company Charlie, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and social gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible iceberg.”
It's not possible to define this because of the breakage caused by ice crystals, which are frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Frozen uses the fluorescent properties of honeycomb synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach Avangarda Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team to match the regular KHL champion against Salavata, noted that the swimmers conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that Avangardu needed to pay more attention to the defence game.
We've seen a video match against the Metallurgy, an official website called "Avangarda" by Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of chips, not a very good time.
They have been missed because of their mistakes, because of their failure to perform the task.
We knew the opponent had an executive.
According to the statistics, they had five traffic attacks, three shots killed us.
It's a very good achievement.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
We're with the boys every match, we're talking after the game, we're getting ready for a new rival.
Main thing is for the installation to be carried out.
Everyone's seen the first period of the Metallurgy match.
The game was completed, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the goal "in the breakup" - and in the third period they got wrong.
In view of the difficulty of the game, he did not see any point in connecting the defenders.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series, matches go through the day, and the team is tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of its timing and the performance of the game.
Hockey's an emotional game, if you do the installation, it's not that complicated.
As a result of the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been set up on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Indonesian officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to establish bio-towels
Hundreds of furs were copied at the border crossings of Russia.
Such a situation arose as a result of changes in the customs rules for the manufacture of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the Russian side has been established in turn, which has previously failed to warn of innovations.
As of 28 October, Russian customs authorities began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, said the Deputy Chief of East Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The missed items work in a stronger way.
The FACTOV correspondent has been on the border and has been in contact with long-term hostages.
The prices in the coffee shop at the pass point of Novozovsk are growing every day, as well as from fur.
The hills stand in a few rows, growing about two kilometers [2 km] away.
The Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vozneck Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From there, goods are shipped to the Stavropolian border of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday morning before midnight they were released, and then introduced these rules, the late fighter Alexei Golovanov (photo) is complaining about the transit through Russia of cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been on his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 rubles).
Those who travel nearby (e.g., Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to 50,000 dollars pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 rubles) and travel.
And the rest of them are locked up. No one has that big money.
Imagine, if a driver is carrying a cargo of just $40,000, but in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 rubles) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are none, the long-distance fighters are located next to their cars.
In the border stores and cafes and so on and so on, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers directed and quickly pushed them: 15 griffin stands for the baton, seven griffins for the cup of coffee, 25 griffin for the cup of soup.
And the coffee one.
And there's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the middle of nowhere. We're going to the bathroom.
You can't wash, you can't shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's on her way.
A week ago, another long-time fighter, Victor Scotarenko, was comforted.
Is it just gonna get to my car in a week?
Why do you have half a litre of water? - we're interested in the only border store.
It's 11 and 15 pins.
What, a bottle of crystal or silver water?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take, as long as there's anything else, a salesman's steaming.
After the situation had begun to light up in the media, the situation of Ukrainian drivers had been brought to the attention of the region ' s authorities.
The management of the Ambrosian and Novoazov Rajosad administrations has been commissioned to ensure that all those who stand at the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, are assured by the Acting President, Sergey Dergunov.
There are now emergency aid teams in the misses.
Biotowels will also be established for the convenience of people.
According to the officer, the problem with the lines will be resolved in the next few days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk bond administration, 32 and 68 vehicles were simplified as at 31 October at the international crossing points of Uspanka and Novozovsk respectively.
“FACTS” will monitor developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow trying to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made by BNS in the Republic Security Department (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow, in particular, is going to “speak” to the President of Lithuania, Dalu Gribauskait, and to publish falsified documents, allegedly found in the Russian Gosarquive, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Administration of the Russian President on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is conducting an analysis of the public administration processes.
The structure is headed by Evgenien Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and attended the Lithuanian People's Party.
The complainant is also a member of department B. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smyrnov regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives before the end of 2012.
Smyrnovu is now prohibited from entering the country.
For the first time, the President of Lithuania, Gribauskait, said that he knew about the information he was preparing for.
In her view, Lithuania's successful Presidency in the Council of the European Union and the country's desire for energy independence is the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had not previously consistently criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin to Lithuania was "unrespectable".
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of the F.F. Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania “one only requirement”.
Remember, in September, Rossufnazur suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in conformity with the health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia does not ban, the Government should prepare a WTO referral.
In the United States, the principal of the school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools literally led to despair.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
An incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, minor hooligans have left the house with a toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened a teenage shot, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the director ' s property, he was charged with assault in difficult circumstances.
The man was released from prison in $125,000.
It is noted that shooting civilians in the United States is a terrible rule of law.
A man literally opened a gun at the center of Ridgecrest in California, U.S.A., right on the street.
After that, the criminal caught two random passersby hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown's primary school, Connecticut was a gunshot.
At school, Adam's mother worked, and she was an educator.
Shooting in American school: wounded 14-year-old girl
A major shooting incident occurred on 31 January in American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
"Dimna" organizes free electric for patients in the Hymka match with "Toma"

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to have confetti, not to sleep late, and not to have a mask for our area.
Now I look more like a cricket.
I have not been asked in the last two years to distribute confections in my apartment and will probably not be this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white raven with respect to Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Different Trade, most Americans, namely 158 million, will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on confectionery, costumes and ornaments.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Different Trade predicts that costumes will cost $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion spent.
This year, the fashionable sex items are unencumbered.
Women are no longer required to represent sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, burgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure the Daft Punk team-style cosmonauts will be in our Instagram band this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Different Trade, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to confiscating, we don't hesitate.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey's chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds' confectionery, Twizzlers' confectionery and Clark Bar's batons.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, these are excellent news for 41 million children who are willing to submit to our regions.
Moreover, we will buy and — and not cheat ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn beans; yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, almost £35 million is sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to talk about.
There's nothing like Halloween like a house of sight.
They have amazing names, such as “The Horror behind the Wall” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “Wy and scream” and “The House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to Americana Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with views that generate about $500 million of income, as well as the amazing photos where you almost described that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't take away, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like a “classic expression of persons”.
And we'll end up talking about the guys.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Tikwa when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lighthouse is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the fashion of a baby in a T-shirt started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these T-shirts, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million a day.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly dipping on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew to £542 million this year.
If you would like more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mattisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut some of their weight in 2032.
Estonia's Mine Defense Site Rehabilitated After Ukrainian Hackers Attack
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia has been restored after the early cyberattack, reports the department's press service.
According to Deputy Chancellor Peterkop of the Ministry of Information and Administrative Affairs, this was a primitive attack, and the site simply overloaded a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set up the site. The site has been restored to date.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Petercope, it is early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We must analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
On 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group deployed a network to confirm a hacker attack on the Estonian Minobande site and protested against the Ukraine and NATO partnership.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO ministers.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says the Anonymous statement.
Formerly, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the Peodosian Marine Battalion, a separate Ukrainian Marine Battalion, would participate in NATO's command-to-command training of the Steadfast Jazz-2013 response forces.
Several schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because of the attack on the students... the goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the practice.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for Europeans, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because of the fact that the hospital was also attacked by the goblins.
Release of the Land Rover hunting series announced
Inside are seat-belts and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a package of services providing access to Bowler Works, logistics support and car storage between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants in Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people who are searching for concerns, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to offer such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try the various disciplines of the rally in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
We were very pleased to have developed the Defender Challenge car — a truly attractive championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian Civilians don't know anything about the Bratsky Circle - New News
INTERFAX.RU writes on this subject with reference to an informed source in RF law enforcement bodies.
“After reports of the introduction of Leps by the United States Finance Ministry to the suspect checklists of the Eurasian 'British Circle ' s criminal union, we reviewed all databases, but did not find such a group," said the Agency's interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributed to the maintenance of the so-called Russian Mafia, which is allegedly operating abroad.
As previously reported, yesterday the U.S. Ministry of Finance published a list of alleged members of the Bratsky Circle criminal group on its website.
Among them was a Russian singer named Gregory Leps.
He's on the list as "Grisha," put out in advance.
They coincide with the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Grygorius Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, Israelis, Uzbek nationals and another member of the former USSR whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phucket, is convinced that he carried money for gangsters on their orders.
A photograph of the singer has been attached to this communication and all of its data has been provided, which corresponds to the validity.
More than that, Leps actually bought a house recently on Phucket.
The Bureau noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
A person ' s inclusion in the American Minfin blacklists would involve blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with persons living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that no notifications were received to the singer: “It’s hard to answer the question whether this is the Grigorie that everything is talking about now in connection with the US scandal.”
All Leps knows is the media.
He had no personal information, although I did not know if they were in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- amazing and unexpected," she said to the RIA News.
According to her, Phockete Grigorie Leps does not live, but according to Minfin U.S.A., he has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps was now on a long journey across the Far East and Siberia, and that news had left him in the city of Blagovestensk.
Escaped on the field in the Sketch match
Some details about the identity of the fan who escaped in the field during match 1/16 came to light.
As stated by the head of the CDC, RFS Arthur Grigorijanz, referring to the data of the CDM, the patient is a mosquito.
He's under arrest right now.
"That's what Grigoryanz told us about how the fan went through the field: "It was reported that this, called the viewer, had gone to a quick help in escorting two viewers, referring to the problems of the heart.
He came to the emergency room. That's what the doctor told us.
Then he drove out the two companions, and fled to the field.
He fled from the East and South Bank to the East and North Bank.
He ran all over the field.
That's what the stewards are responsible for.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is a Stuart Action Zone - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the Tribune, crossed the East Tribune.
And then riots began in the Eastern Tribune and on the escape routes," said the head of the KDK.
Recall that the Moscow Spartak decision will bring to the fore the 15th Tour of the Russian Championship against Locomotive and Zenita without spectators, and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire squads have been called to rescue a lost dog, who has been stuck 50 feet above the ground for a dangerous career.
Koker-Spaniel Ruby fled after she got into a small DTP
Three days later, her career ended, and she noticed a man pulling out a dog.
The firemen came down on the springbed to save the dog from the inevitable death.
The dog was happy to be saved after fire teams were set up to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place after he somehow stopped 50 feet at the dangerous retreat of the spring shelter.
The nine-month-long Ruby cockroache ran off after she got into a car crash on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was saved from a career on Wednesday.
Her boss, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Fleppit career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire Rescue Service.
They were eager to search for their missing dog and put on social media sites after she had gone to work after a small accident.
Approximately 14:15 in the middle of the night, a dogdog noticed Ruby standing at the height of 50 feet at a career retreat.
The technical rescue team from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transmission to lift her up onto the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said she was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the spring slope — 50 feet [50 m] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move, she didn't move, and she stopped.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate the liver.
That was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is amazing.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have saved her.”
It was likely that she could have had a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found that everything was OK with it, except for dehydration and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall, from Galifaxa, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching salvation was terrible”.
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she came back to us.
The veterinarian said that if she had hung up and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The fires were magnificent.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them was adorable.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitley added, "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a back vocalist for Jaggera's 2004 Old Habits Die Hard song.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker, and she said, "He was playing with me when I was 18. "
She said, “That was a long time ago, and he was a very good man.”
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said that he “categorically denies that he ever made a hit on Katie Perry”.
He said, ‘It may be she will mislead him with another.’
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerewan: a break with Europe gives the Scottish people a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland should join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with a railing along Adrian's wave.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the potential economic benefits of more free movement across Europe, although, as predicted, it did not appear in headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU Member States are spending a lot of time reversing their formal rules as they would like.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And the old man who turned her into a rock star: for the first time, I heard a "run" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the old story.
Why should the independent Scotland at all comply with Europe's orders?
Why turn the London jar into Brussels jar, especially now?
Here is what is happening in Europe: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, the anti-EU or the abolition of the euro as a single currency is coming into force.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, which was founded only this year, came out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially stamping out the "Free Democrats" (alike our "Liberal Democrats") from the Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to a federal Europe plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the environment imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working on excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters, which are German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is in an unfavourable situation on production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut wages and public expenditures, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budgetary and currency problems are a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the "green" energy package implemented by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies from the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times as much as gas in the United States.
It's paralyzing adverse price conditions, as we've already seen in Granjmute.
No freeze of wages in the world will stop the crushing defeat of US cheap shale gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, once the most angry side of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France in a catastrophic situation.
The result was the right to vote against the EU's Marin Le Pen National Front just won the decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes — a timely warning to the British Labourers that it cannot be assumed that the division between the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use elections in the EU next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, and this is very likely, the anti-EU parties will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
In my opinion, the rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are fighting together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like a floating “Europe (the sovereign) nations”, which liked General de Goll.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will remain unattainable in the cold of the Atlantic.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other emerging countries will be simple in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, however, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at countering measures of a harsh economy that received an overwhelming majority of votes in 2011 due to objections to the reduction of the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Alistair Darling Treasury and subsequently by the coalition of the Turks and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be reluctant to vote for independence only in order to take action against the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual congenitalization: aging earlier
African-American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual intercourse is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity epidemics can be one of early sexual mutilation mechanisms
Early sexual maturity tends to be less pronounced in boys
Former correspondent CNN Pat Eterge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop the beginnings of milky iron and her skull hair grows at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Paul Kaplovic explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — usually not a quick onset of full sexual maturity,” Koplovitz said.
There are obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, skull and mucous membranes and body smells.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstrual period) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before menarche,” said Koplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Sexual Mutilation in Girls: How to Cope With this Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate check on how sexual convulsions will progress.
There was a discussion about what was the actual onset of sexual maturity, but it was considered “temporary” when breast enlargement was accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases the process will be delayed or suspended — that is what a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progress can serve as a basis for endocrinologist analysis to eliminate serious problems such as swelling or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstrual periods and to prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which may eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in mature age.
Recommendations on medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
He is careful with drugs, but recognizes that “sex depression can alleviate behavioral problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from peers”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they deal with hygiene issues,” Koplovitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls one woman, whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many advertising theories about the causes of early sexual mutilation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are blamed.
Boys — like girls — have sexual intercourse earlier.
Coplovitz claims that the most important requirement is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which connects the number of fats in the body with the time of sexual mutilation.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
The world's early sexual growth is likely to have an impact on everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Still a mystery: Although boys have hair on their face and on their skulls at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual mutilation is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and children of childbearing potential are exposed to the appearance of hair on their foreheads and thighs.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true incidence of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, Child Endocrineologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be restricted to receiving instructions from a pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
“This may mean a conversation earlier than expected,” Koplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who grow early need to confirm that even when this happens before, it is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing in Chita is preparing to take a trip
The open-air Treaty observers flying over the territory of Russia and the unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, 1 November, will leave the city's airspace at 8:30 a.m. in Moscow.
The management of the airport authorized the flight of the ship and received fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
He'll be sent to the United States.
It was reported that the Ulan-Ude plane landed in the Zabaykali region because of the fog.
He was not released from Chita Airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights on the airport territory, ITAR-TASS reports.
As reported in the TIR RF, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Sky, people on board the aircraft are not entitled to leave outside the Chita airport, they can only undergo border controls at two Russian airports - in Cuba and in Ulan-Ude.
An open-air treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating.
Observer flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of the monitoring of arms control agreements, the empowerment of crisis prevention and crisis resolution in the OSCE and other international organizations.
How to earn late acquaintances - IK in the U.S.
The highest income rating for live celebrities in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013, was 160 million.
It is notable that others who have fallen out of their lives have been "earned" a few times less in the past year.
The second was Elvis Presley, 55 million per year, and the third was the author of the Peanuts Charles Schultz comics with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million) entered the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, Igoria Gulaev's first shop opened
On 23 October, the opening of the first Igora Gulaev flagship shop in Moscow took place.
Designer Igory Gulaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury mecha products.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans -- in Moscow, they finally opened their first store, which is why the designer and set up a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls in Russia live.
That's why I'm especially glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's exactly what Igor said. He cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to...
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are placed on the horse
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute over the width of the travel class seats on the long journeys, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on the long-distance journeys to the class-economy passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of airline attention, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims of the effectiveness of the last aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that would have a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the classrooms, but its main American competitor Boeing said it should be decided by airlines.
There is a dispute as aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected for the events of 17-21 November.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 people are in a row, is central to the statements on the economic efficiency of the new mini-bus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will replace 406 people based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would carry 350 people in an economic class with a width of 18 inches in a row.
Construction giants are often exchanged for technical hits using professional press advertising.
Now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the Dubai Air Force, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war, showing the financialists a slide depicting three people in a restaurant attached to each other, entitled “Would you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers long-distance flights on seats smaller than regional turbo-vine aircraft”, said Airbus John Liha, sales manager.
With a change in the diet, people are gaining weight, but aircraft seats have not changed at all.
By the early 1970s, when the large-scale Boeing 747 set standards for modern travel, and the average American man's weight from 40 to 49 years of age had increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the 21st-century average American male is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitors adhered to the 1950s session concepts, when the average size of the plates of those recently called “reactive audience” was already.
Airbus said that a study indicated that an additional inch in the width of the seat improved the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures on seat sizes and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines strike a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It is indeed a matter of providing airlines with the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said the expert Boeing on Kent Craver’s lounges.
They don't want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their case better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is an increase in the area on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is due to a competition for orders for aircraft estimated at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades — enough to alter the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is what warms up the competition between the latest reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing report a 20 per cent increase in profits per place in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated Boeing characteristics are partly based on the comparison of 10 local 777X rows with the original 9 local composition of the constructive decision 777.
Wins in some ways are reduced compared to the 10th place composition currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to press more places and make his plane more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Passenger Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that saloons with a complete 10-point range for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a flat landing that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“A seat with a width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that commercially the Airbus proposal is a threat from the 777th model,” said an interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Reactive aircraft sellers travel around the world even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
In a comfortable way, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flexible compartment for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the lounges, offering more space for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, according to experts, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “flight up”, but may distract attention from the 777X model.
A new anti-incotin vaccine may deplete the smoking process
Scientists have developed an anti-incotin vaccine that could prevent cigarette smoking.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests were needed before testing on people, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a non-injurious virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable antibody flow.
Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a nicotine impact smoker.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were “depressed”, and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the cases had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it converts cells into the anti-cancer plant.
Professor Cristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of nicotine vaccine, and this can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oilseeds: the third rural settlements of Sub-Moscow
Vice-Governor of Sub-Moscow Yuri Olejnikov said almost three rural settlements in the Moscow area are fully subsidized
All grants from the region's budget are received by 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent are grants.
Some 25 billion rubles are sent from the area budget," said Olejnik.
The Deputy Governor also noted that only three urban settlements -- Mitišt, Odinzovo and Pušino -- had more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, which is “not enough”.
The cost of maintaining local administrative equipment in 88 settlements in Sub-Moscow is more than 70 per cent, “with reduced quality of service”, said Olejnik.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of the municipal institutions of Sub-Moscow by the end of November to consider what settlements needed to be grouped, brought together in urban districts or to change the administrative system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Previously, the Governor of Moscow said that the administrative reform in Sub-Moscow planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
Also in Mojay, Kasher, Solnečkir, Colomen, Lüberz and Kotelnik there is a request for the consolidation of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The President of Mosbulduma Igor Brannalov also said that the whole of the coming reform is planning to bring together about 30 rural settlements in the 12 areas of Sub-Moscow.
This is due to the fact that less than one third of 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 are grantable.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what she finds great pleasure in raising her children.
Although Arbenina is now giving much time to creativity and public activities, she still has the opportunity to travel with Martha and Artema, not only spending time in their training, but also having fun as much as she can.
During the last week, Diana twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, I asked the fans, and I showed them how they ordered Artema and Martha to Halloween.
Our first Halloween is what Diana called a photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are concerned with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany introduces “unspecified sex” in Europe when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “unspecified” in the registration of children born with hermaphrodites instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the gender graph in a birth certificate that is incomplete.
Instead of “F” (female sex) or “M” (male sex) parents may write “X” (unspecified).
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from pressuring an emergency with a gender-specific operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are under the influence of Obeid
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripody, will be a figure in the investigation of the State ' s anti-corruption supervisory body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied changes to the lease of marine facilities at the request of his political teacher, Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned three properties on public land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) expanded its investigation Friday into whether Mr. Obeid had been lobbying for several state ministers to extend the lease to Cerkular Ki, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and coffee, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripody knew the secret of Mr. Obeid ' s participation in real estate, following the testimony given by the former Deputy Head of Administration, Mr. Tripody Linn Espoul, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be offered to open competition.
The tenants objected and wanted longer rental periods.
In 2009, leases to Serkular Ki, which had brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without opening the competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, had urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
In August and September 2007, discussions between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dan, senior officer, who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's leadership in the Fisheries Division, were presented by the ICAC.
“Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations about the development of a commercial lease policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willie, Commissioner Tripody.
“No,” said Mr. Tripoddy.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to the senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets within Syria
The senior administrator of the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had been targeted in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer didn't say it was a goal, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose of the Russian production was to launch SA-125.
At least two times earlier this year, Israel was carrying airships on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of class 457 may be tested for “defence”
The “deepness” test for foreign workers on the visas of class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand repressive measures.
If adopted, this test will be applied on the criteria for preventing the use of Class 457 visas for filling unskilled posts or as a lasagna for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxin McKay criticized the Government ' s rhetoric regarding foreign workers, said it might offend the neighbours of Australia.
“The huge statements of the type “foreigners — at the end of the day” and “the work of Australians at first” constitute a very unpleasant departure from the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Institute “Australia — India” today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the echoes of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper before the discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the “deepness” criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined as to whether “there is a true candidate under conditions where the applicant is a relative or a close acquaintance of the owner or person concerned with the financing of the enterprise”.
Businesses may also be required to account for the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since before the enterprises that were intended to sponsor a small number of workers then took up work hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine - year - old son of the deceased accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death in the middle of the night, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Comrade Semen Varlamov stated that hockey suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey team of the Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he was suffering from alcoholism, the Russian News Service passed on.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking”, said, inter alia, a woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk has been sued for beating the Golchiper of the Russian Assembly of Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player brushed her hair and beat her--after the attack she had damaged her hands, chest, life and neck.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released for $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen in the country ' s movements, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He was also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland on the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and Northern England, with the beginning of the first phase in 2026
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer noted that the project would “unite Britain”.
Scottish Transport Minister Kit Brown said he was “in the east” from the perspective of working with the Government of Great Britain.
The first stage will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has entrusted HS2 Ltd with further improvements in the transit capacity of the railway and reduced travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronnessa Kramer said: “Our goal of HS2 is to create a national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of passability in our railway network.
But it is also about urban transport; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive better communication thanks to HS2.
Scotland's Secretary-General Alistair Carmike added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmikla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for the high-speed rail throughout the UK”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the following steps.
Tori is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy takes place without anything else, but leaves a lot of waste behind.
Scientists have recently pointed to the Torah as another radioactive element of the Mendeliev system.
It meets around the world, and according to experts, it does not leave waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia as long as they remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to exclude their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US mitigation measures.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are upset that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision requiring US airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases are still in force in Australia.
“The safety management of civil aviation flights currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” she said.
This issue is regulated by the rules that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and passengers to comply with the security rules that members of the crew report to them.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the increase in use on board her entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against the change, but stated that she would follow the regulations.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of the authorisation of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it is on our aircraft,” the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that the rules currently in force would be in place.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it as soon as possible,” she said.
The FAA decision is applicable to US airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the decisions of FAA and the causes of it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Vehicles will be required to demonstrate that their aeroplanes have resistance to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, handling standards and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline has verified and confirmed its fleet’s interoperability, it may allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” FAU said.
In rare cases, poor visibility of the crew will give passengers instructions to disable their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Daguestan is heard in the high school Cubani notes of extremism
The football match between Anji and Kubanu has emerged into a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar and Daguestan after the ills set fire to the Daguestan flag, and the Cuban gymnastics sounded different.
The head of Daguestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court on Thursday, because the Krasnodar High School has allegedly appealed to international differences, in particular to call for a war against "bassurmans".
Take the gymnastics of the Krasnodar region, which has been approved in 1995.
It's a disgrace, and nobody cares.
"Remembering you here as the mother of a relative, an enemy, we are going to the bashurmanina for a death battle," said Abdullah President of the Hizri Shichsaid Parliament, "to write in the gymnast, to feed some believers in other believers."
Putin obtained impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, that is, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian production rockets, which were reportedly meant for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important requirement to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done in the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and allowing the United States not to carry out a military operation that they had reached this summer.
More detailed about weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell us.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 peacekeepers, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poisonous gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombings, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Assad, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will withdraw from its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had decomposed declared chemical production plants.
The longer and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said the days of Assad were considered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets and assaults.
His opponents are disarmed and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to feed with leaves and cubes.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was called a success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, D.C., the US Ambassador to Syria has had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, is his mother not much easier than not being killed by chemical weapons?
Assad's still holding.
And he's changing weapons to power.
President RF set up a separate Ministry of Construction and ŽKH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, created a new ministry that was driving construction and construction issues and invited his former Governor of the Ivanov Region of Mikhail Menu to take the lead in the process of a private meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mein in his residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and I did not refuse to take over the new office.
The Russian President's Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all construction and CZKH functions were moving to the new Ministry of Mining.
Michael Menn, son of the famous Orthodox priest of the protoiere Alexander Mena, finished the Moscow Oil Institute of the name of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected to the Moscow District of the Sergievo-Posada region, was a Deputy State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow Region, and a Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menn was Governor of the Ivanov Region.
Lumberjack owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having difficulty
In a lobby at the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthhalinga sets a gold bracelet, ring and string to pay for her daughter's school education.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there,” says Mrs. Amirthhalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its business, has become the third landmark on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthhalinga) but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Lombars in Singapore usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, which is higher than 15.4% of the local creditor offered at the United Foreign Bank office at the same commercial centre.
However, the brakes have the advantage that they do not require verification of creditworthiness or evidence of wages and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people throughout the region are turning to the lobby, as families are under pressure because of the increased cost of living and the rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth following the global financial crisis, and low- and medium-income families, low-income families are turning to low-income countries to compensate for income cuts as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit side, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' credit ability.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list by 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decrease in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“It is true that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wun, a CIMB economist, a Malaysian bank.
A record of high gold prices in the last two years has increased the urgency with which people are betting their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the objects laid at 200 law-enforcement lombards are gold.
People say, "The price for gold is good. Let's put on a golden string of granny and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest lobby operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months to up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the lumber business such as ValueMax, an office operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent of the S$66 million involved this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors were critical because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah said that Lambard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
“Customers are betting on the items they already own, and the moneyisation of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The Foundation is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
In addition, there are not only categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, setting gold paintings or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchases in cash.
We see customers from all levels of society.
“They include permanent persons who need to make short-term use of money for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises who need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population not to have the number and status of existing medical institutions, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the Health Modernization of the Tull Region for 2011-2013 will enable the reorganization of the health facilities of our city to create an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynecological diseases, pregnancy and births.
Thus, after joining the backbone, there was an even greater opportunity to attract NGCB-based close specialists from the GHG to consult with patients with various pathologies, to carry out additional hospital-based surveys.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the logistics base of the home had been significantly improved and modern equipment conforming to world standards had been introduced.
In these years, approximately 8 million rubles have been allocated for the capital renovation of the premises, and 112 units of equipment have been purchased for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the case of a cesarean, the Sell-Saiver machine is used to collect blood from the operating wound and to return it after special treatment by avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory diagnostic office.
An electronic registry is in operation in the women ' s consultation, e-cards and patient history are planned to be introduced in the near future.
As a result of the development of telemedicine, it has been possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, births and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Cechni was arrested by the French police for suspecting a prostitute in serious assaults.
The investigation has been carried out since March of the current year.
Some 60 women complained about caucasians.
The gangs reportedly ordered a prostitute to one of Strasbourg’s hotels and then were beaten and robbed.
The leader of the gang was 27-year-old Chechnya.
The defender of Bavaria, David Alaba, became Austria's best sportsman in 2013, reports the official Bundesligi website.
In this dispute, he defeated winter sports, which are traditionally the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the miner Marcel Hirscher, and the third was the bow on the ladder with Gregor Schlirenceauer's trampline.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian-born Austrian helped his team to win the League of Champions, Championships and Kubke Germany, as well as the UEFA SuperCubbke.
Former Archavin's wife is resting with actor André Chadov
An ex-citizen of Peter's "Zenita" football wife, Andrey Archavin Julia Baranowski, is taking a vacation with actor Andreem Chadov.
Julia is a retired Italian actress named Anastasia Zaradinova, her wife, Sergey Slavov, and actress Andrey Chadov.
Photographs of the pair's joint holes are published in Instagram Anastasia Zaregi.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Railway published a picture of the couple on the coast of the Finnish Gulf in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the Zenita Hubbek Andrei Archavin acknowledged that they were living separately from their civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrey Archavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It was recently known that Archavin met with the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
The new friend of Archavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Savings package of $325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for a weakened health system in Tasmania will be complemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the Government will not waste its resources.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersec, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “emergency measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
A four-year funding decision was taken following consultations of the Government with an independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
“The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Mrs. Plibersec said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per planning campaign.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome delay.
There is also money for clinics that receive patients without pre-registration in Hobart and Lonseston to improve the quality of care after the station, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will focus on the ideas put forward by advanced doctors on how better to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersec.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work under strict reporting and accountability.
The State would need to maintain the current levels of funding to obtain the Commonwealth ' s funds and to report annually on where it would spend those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilky said today that $325 million would not decide “if there were no real reform that would put the health system of Tasmania on a more sustainable basis”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the conclusion of this state’s health system from a critical point of view,” said Mr. Wilky.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures compensate significantly for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a solution similar to that of leukoplasty”.
“The reason we are here is that the Labour Government has cut $430 million out of the health system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be said that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Gyom Nickle Romane Deni Didro can be an exceptional setting and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
A 1760s French film tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to a convent in her family.
When she starts rebelling, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadist and stubborn and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down until it's gone or gone — and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious festive nature, the story could be a test for the type of prisoner and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production, the observation group says.
Syria destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, the international monitoring group declared on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances appear to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made within one day before
the deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “make ineffective” all means of chemical weapons production and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with toxic gas and filling them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, the destruction of existing weapons and stocks is still to be begun in Damascus.
The country is believed to have some 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including gorilla gas and nerve-paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the violent battles in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts believe that chemical weapons are being manufactured and stored, reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights in Britain.
The Group of Activists, which was tracking the loss through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On behalf of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 people were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18 678 were pro-governmental fighters and 187 Lebanese warriors of Hezbollah.
Also among those killed, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military fugitives and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad ' s troops fought in Safira for a few weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fight highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who were being pursued by their mission to release Syria from the toxic arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied that it had verified and seen destroyed all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/processing claimed by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They couldn't visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to the Syrian declaration, “disposed and... objects of the chemical weapons programme contained therein had been moved to other declared sites that had been verified”.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether Safira had been one of the two places OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you all have shown in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumju Monitoring Group, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been in the hands of rebels, mainly Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alavit sect, the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the leader of Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on the environment at the PVO site in the coastal province of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Angry about the condemnation of a terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted in anger to the last of the defenders who appeared before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The patch, which ran for almost 10 years, as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment for its role in the establishment of explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted a conditional release.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and tens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related accusations, including the wave of church explosions across Indonesia into the Christmas Canon in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person who was a “traper” for his reputation as a master in the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perta Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She could hardly hold back her tears and said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He has to appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarai Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation in a parked van immediately after 11 evening on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist bomber blew up a Rucksack that started with an explosion just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma and “dead” three times, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share in three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the bloody battle, Amrose, Muhlas and Imam Samudra, who had been punished four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keeping him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
The Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be brought before the court.
He was hiding for almost ten years, but at the end of January 2011, he was detained in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the U.S. forces killed former Al-Qaida leader Usama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence data had shown that the Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore relations between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he has not regretted the pain he has caused to others.
The 10th anniversary of the attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
The duck can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use boyfriends on airplanes (but don't call mobile)"
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
As such a change is rapidly taking place, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAU Administrator Michael Wert at the press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and device layout rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted the plans.
“We could approve the expansion of electronic devices, depending on the state of the plan, very soon,” said FAU.
Passengers are currently obliged to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They must not be relaunched until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain will not be “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aeroplane is lowered for landing and not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and rolling, FAA stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi on high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Boat Managers, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), this will be an unbeatable option,” Glading said.
We have openly become “schoolworkers” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or uploading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
Thus, there is still no word of "friends" — the intellectual internet game in which the actor Alec Balduin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was taken off American Airlines for refusing to shut down the device when the plane was on landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be installed in the trunk since they can hurt someone if they fly all over the living room.
Phone calls on the flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority on telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not FAA.
FAA may remove some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, a national transport safety expert CBS News, said that hundreds of phones were still at risk.
“The hundreds of phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigational devices, but we know from the FCS that they can create interference for the release of hundreds when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee, established by FAO to study this issue, recommended last month that the Government allow for greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increased pressure on FAA to reduce restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as the Senator-Democratic from the state of Missouri, claim that there are no major security-related reasons for bans.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become universal.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to disable their devices.
FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to communications of interference for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech boyfriends at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAA as electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners have been adapted to make use of electronic devices more widely, according to the new guidelines, said Warta.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit much less power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, only emit minimum signals when listing pages.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers were Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the companies loaded the entire aircraft with their devices for reading Kindle's electronic books and flew on it to check for problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said that he considered the interference from the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other Committee members said that there were only separate pilot communications confirming that devices could create interference for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during landings on devices under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step forward for passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the United States Tourist Association.
Car schools will be able to conduct driver rights examinations
Exams on driving rights will be able to receive private companies with their own computerized motorway.
This is what the Commercial writes about with reference to the draft Government's decision on the "Authorization of Vehicle Management".
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such highways in Russia.
Students of such “privileged” car schools are expected to take into account the results of internal testing.
However, the Gosavto Inspectorate will monitor the submission of the exams every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theory exams and more than 20 per cent of the student's field do not give up for the first time, such school will be deprived of the privilege for half a year.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government regulation enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also requires two-wheel drive training.
From 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles for category A rights will be required to pass a city test.
Moreover, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign-right drivers.
Such workers will be required to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird that has been transported by air to a safe place from a storm station in the North Sea is released back into the wild
The bird, which was transported by air to the shore after it was found in a depleted state on an oily high in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This waterfowl was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdin last month and was then taken out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruel Treatment of Animals (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This waterfowl is probably a winter migrant from North Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea”.
Looks like the bird hung up and could find refuge on an oil tower.
He said, “She was unable to fly again, so she sought help from us.”
The shepherd boy was healthy and well until he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and identify what changes the well-being and jobs of Britain want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a large business across the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will prove unexpected to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are stalling.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to the Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in Europe's trading zone, with even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
The last and most obvious thing is that our survey of business leaders has found that the obvious majority wants Britain to take a course in amending the treaty and in relations with the EU based on trade rather than on politics.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is insisting on “significant change”, which will return power back to Britain.
High rates are the achievement of changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for the United Kingdom will provide 16 per cent of the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt about this: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the conditions of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, this means greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s regulatory activities.
U.S. Special Services Listening to the Roman Pope's Personal Phone
The Vatican is under the supervision of American special services.
New documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. investigation has led to the hearing of all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now heavily caring for the Pope of France.
His phone began to be heard before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also under observation.
What was of particular importance in the United States?
The special service was connected to hundreds of cardinals who had gathered in Rome to choose the Pope.
The telephones of the residence were also heard where the conclave participants lived.
The American spies have heard all the main applicants on the Pope's throne to prevent it from appearing undesirable to Washington.
The magazine Panorama reports that the U.S. “large ear” continued to hold the prelate talks until the conclusion of the convention on 12 March.
It has been claimed that, since 2005, the Argentine archbishop of Bergolio has been appointed as the future Pope of Rome.
The U.S. survey also held negotiations on the election of the new President of the Bank of the Vatican.
The Italian magazine writes that the United States Embassy continues to work under the cover of a secret group of CIA and ANA operators who obtain information on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully declared that it is not interested in the American “insultation”, even if it is happening.

Snowboarder for the Olympic Cup specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a memo on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The buyer's name is 100 rubles.
But bloggers' networks are already actively ironing about the memory banknote.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they pointed out that the picture of a banknote cruiser can be found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo store, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megabour on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear's smartphone advertising.
The Olympic Banknote is in blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, the snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other hand, is a type of Olympic stadium and the Ghar bird.
Author of the Banknote Design - Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art in the name of Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered, such as mountaineer, fristil, and trampline spree, but eventually they chose the boat because they were relatively young.
According to the "Reports" source near the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the public's view of the widespread spread of the picture of the shipyard from the Olympic Banknote and is now studying the situation.
And here in González is not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic Banknote.
The Press Manager, Ms. Natalya Nikiforov, said "Reports", that all discussions about the plagiarism were ridiculous.
The bank's snowboarder returned to the right, to the pictures in the networks - to the left, - clarified Nikiforova.
The man at the photo session to create the shop was taken from different points, then a final image was chosen, and on it was a characteristic outside the boatboard.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic Banknote, since the artist had been paid for his work.
In the opinion of the experts, the discussion of the image on the Olympic Cup was positive.
The recognition of the image on the purchase -- plus for its promotion -- is considered by the executive director of the P.A. RusBrend, Alexei Popowicev.
It is quite difficult to prove the percentage of images on the shop and in the photo banks, so the claim for intellectual property dispute cannot be made.
For the first time, the Olympic Banknote appeared in China for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 and the Memorial Banknote was issued in 10 June.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Law bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their findings, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the previous level in the coming year, and this is the best.
Although businessmen initially expected to grow.
The current year is a failure for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
All of this was led by the head of one of the largest beer companies in the country, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute for Daily Demand in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and circulation of beer, which is low in alcohol, has been reported to Sheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market that it is unpredictable to introduce all new and new unreasonable prohibitions that are based on the allegations of combating alcohol abuse.
brewer noted that many legislative bans aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but all new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages in kiosks has been more severe than any of the beer producers since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Scheps.
For the next year, brewers have two predictions.
Optimistic is what Scheps said: the sale of foam drinks remains at the previous level.
Pessimistic will fall by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the classes that are intended for the mass user in the "premium" class: the beer will become smaller, but it will be expensive.
However, the effects of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
“In my view, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said Dr. Dr. Alexei Sotnik.
True, the proportion of patients who use heavy drinks surrogate, as well as those who “substitute” alcohol toning drinks such as Jaguara, has increased, while ten years ago, alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Motor Factory in the Universe.
According to the trade unions, all fired received compensation.
Where, however, the problem of workers is more acute than the problem of reducing production in the region.
Deputy to Zaksa Aleksey Ethanov said that about 600 people had been reduced in the Ford plant in Universe.
He said that this had happened in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory on a voluntary release programme, which had been developed together with the trade union.
“Golden parachutes” were proposed by workers who decided to resign on their own initiative, with several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority have left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Ethanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
However, in the next two years, the authorities are not planning to adopt any programmes of support for regional enterprises in difficulty," he explained, adding that when the budget is adopted, the Government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In Ford, this information is not rejected or confirmed.
We expect the company's response, and as soon as it shows up, we'll have to publish it.
Talks about reducing workers at the Ford plant in the Universe have long been going on.
For example, in September, 600 people became aware of the company's plans to fire.
In the past, the plant claimed to stop the production of cars.
The factory was called a fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4% in 2013 as a result of nine months.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Mobiles will be available in the United States during take-off and landing
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing have been approved in the United States, BBC Telecommunication reported.
It is expected that US airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the trip, and new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, contact with the Internet to receive and send an e-mail will be prohibited during flights less than 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interfering with aircraft radio equipment, the 100th voter will remain under ban.
Air passengers are thus allowed to read electronic books, play games on board and other gadgets and watch video during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they are capable of dealing with the alleged impact of mobile phones on aircraft technology and aircraft management.
According to data from the United States, for example, Britain may also review the current standards of use of electronic devices in flights.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, a new name was finally added - "British Circle"
This week, the black list of Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis into the Bratsky Circle.
One of the Russians turned out to be a well-known singer, Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspected of transporting money for group members.
In the United States blacklist, 22 members of the Bratian Circle and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts have doubts about the existence of such an organization.
“The Bratsky Circle Declaration is more likely to unite disunited criminal groups,” said an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, the Bratsky Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” says Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelly University.
“If they work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Bratian Circle unites the closest Russian gate in the Aslan Usojan law, known as Dad Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, Lashi Shushanashvili and Zechariah Calashov, who had completed the 2012 list, were closely associated with Grandpa Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was the nephew of Grandpa Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals had no relationship with Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were brought together rather in the common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, which led to such a decision as to why it was included in such lists, said the Press Secretary of the Head of State Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of RF.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the RF, its interests will be protected.
Gazprom Head Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom.
“Today is a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes across Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russia ' s gas is destined for Europe, increases the risk to ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller said that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the whole project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual pipeline project capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has known.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 indictment against a childcare agency in Karingbah, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the commission’s opening statement stated that it “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
Chief Executive Director Philippe Haira was asked about one case when YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and about another case when the sports instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA, in its opening speech to the Commission, also allowed inaccuracies, claiming that “there were external YMCA checks that recognized that YMCA was in the first rows for child safety”.
The submissions of the certificates indicate that YMCA has been notified that it has received a second from the end of the four possible evaluations of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the leadership below had let him down by hiring Lord, and had not been able to provide a clear understanding to staff of his obligations regarding reporting child security policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years of his work at YMCA.
He was in prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that corporate ethics had prevented staff members from reporting violations of the Lord ' s child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, that he was personally caring for them, that he put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by the Lord and asked to be trained to protect her children, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jackie Barnat, the childcare manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was the leader of the Lord, was “very scary and often difficult”.
The Executive Director said that he did not explain to the staff that it was difficult for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord had led them from the point of view of the need to communicate about him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had submitted his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson from the “event with Jonathan Lord” was not “information provided” by the staff and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictments had occurred had been adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on child care, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was intended to prevent a lack of evidence, but they were “persistent” and did not realize it.
YMCA New South Wales was not safe for children by the organization during its work during the period 2009-2011 by Jonathan Lord, Professor Stephen Smallboun of Griffith University, informed the Commission of the problems of child rearing.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearings are suspended until 20 December.
It's a fashion week in San Paulo.
Her family is considered not just a model but a present star.
Although Giselle Bundsheen had for some time left her job on maternity leave, she had come to a special stage in those days and this week.
The absence of many months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the floor and on the floor.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time she took part in the "Colcchi" brand.
The end of the fashion week is usually the most interesting show.
Like what Stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
The brand is over 30 years old, in parallel with the pre-port production of the luxury class, the model works actively in theatre and cinema, making shows and making costumes for many famous paintings.
Overall, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are involved in the textile and fashion industry participated in the final week of the fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamicly developing areas of production, which employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual traffic reaches $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he was taking advantage of the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
The next evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician gave his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Blair has avoided much discussion of British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to a quarter of the Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to a question as to whether he would return to prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely, so ... "
Major Coach Milana Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret at the zero result of the 10th Italian Tour of the Lazio Championship.
The expert also noted that the failure at the start was caused by a series of injury to leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, but Tmw brings up the words of Allegry.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good odds.
In the first time, we didn't allow "Lacio."
In the second Roman, they added, but I can't say at all that we lost our concentration.
We should have won.
Last season, we had the task of joining the League of Champions.
Now we're out of the chart, but it's due to a whole series of key football injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
These are very good games, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Koka, who had a high-level meeting.
Contestants arriving at Cardiff to fight for the Loshad Prize of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first steps, this kid and his fat-ass Shetland pony Toffi took a three-tour race to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adults far behind.
This inseparable pair — the same growth — received high ratings for the appearance, behavior and style of the annual competition, held by the Sannibank horse sports center in Radri near Cardiff.
After taking a general look at the background of men and women in fancy caps, he pushed his hat aside and proudly carried around two years of Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability to handle horses less than a year later.
And Toffy was highly valued for her appearance and character.
Fenton was donated to Toffi on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffy are a great duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cube and a rose.
It was just his second speech with Toffy, and we were all in the race when he won.
Perfectly unknown people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture of him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near Ebwell in South Wales, is walking on his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been riding horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howels said: "The whole public was beaten, and all were shouting for approval and boyfriends."
He ran across the sand all the way to the arena and, though he looked so small, did his job wonderfully.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two monkeys he cares about.
As he began, soon he will be taking part in the Loshade Year — and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his dog."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves at the show ring.
They appreciate the consistency of the pony speech and the producer — Fenton and Toffi were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive order, he was really good at his role.
Published a call from the Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued the first call for the acquittal of the complainant, should be reorganized, the press regulator reported.
The New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Junzhou.
But Mr. Cheng later admitted on television that he had taken the lead in writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now the New Expression must proceed “the process of complete correction of errors”, the regulator said.
The “distortion of errors” was issued by the Ugandan Government in the areas of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express newspaper had published several false reports on Zoomlion's stock exchange from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The guide to the New Expression was disoriented,” said the regulator.
He reported that the decision had been made to “deprive Chen Junjau of the administrative recovery in the form of a revocation of his reporting licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make complete correction of the errors in the New Expression and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the newspaper’s responsible persons and immediately amend the New Expression guidelines”.
Mr. Cheng wrote several articles for the New Expression, in which he reported financial violations in the company ' s construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his paper published two appeals for his release on the first floor, stating that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as all the news industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he said, “the public broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After the confessions, Mr. Chenja “New Express” issued an apology on the first floor, stating that the newspaper was unable to properly verify his reports.
Several high-ranking suspects have recently been admitted to television.
Experts say that China ' s recognition practices continue to be widespread, despite recent amendments to the laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-defence.
U.S. tunnel — Mexico for drug trafficking equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as one of the most complex, ever-discovered, underground tunnels.
This tunnel, which has a zigzag length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unmarkedly transferred through it, as stated by the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to the law enforcement officers, had been charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they shall be sentenced to 10 years ' imprisonment until life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels have been found in Central Mexico since the harvest of marijuana in October, which has given drug addicts a difficult task of fast delivery to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found some 700 yards long, equipped with railways, that went from one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November
Pensions have been increased in Belarus since November of this year, reporting to the BELTA correspondent in the main management of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection's pension provision.
With effect from 1 November of the current year, the average wage adjustment of workers in the Republic applied to the previous re-calculation of pensions will be made with an increase of 5.4% and the corresponding re-calculation of pensions in accordance with the Order of 21 October 2013 No. 478 on the Increase of Pensions.
As a result of the recalculation since November, working pensions by age will be estimated to increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The pension increase affects 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for pension payments in excess of November of this year will be increased by Br274.3 billion per month.
At the same time, with the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pensions will be recalculated due to an increase in the average per capita minimum budget.

British police issued an extradition notice to Assanju
The British police today issued a notification of the release of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assang, who hid in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland-Yard said they had handed over to a 40-year-old Australian “official requirement to surrender” requiring him to appear at the police station, adding that if he did not comply with that requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju is threatened by extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand over to the United States on 19 June, he was hiding in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum in this South American country.
Scotland-Yard “has handed over to a 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our election”, according to the press secretary.
It continues to violate the conditions of release under bet.
The Embassy refused to comment on a police notification.
Assang fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to be charged with espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic posts on WikiLeaks' website.
A driver with a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The driver was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Houi of Tiptri, Essex, was observed following his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Braintri on May 27th.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink for his export between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Howie recognized the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven fines resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Houi also committed to pay costs of £90 and an additional charge for assistance to victims of crime of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners will lead to the London bubble
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measure, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborn, who introduced in the 2012 budget a rate of public duty of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in society rather than as individuals.
To date, the housing hospitality in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, is already above the total amount taken together by Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, northwest, Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook said: “After increased hospitality to expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-refoulement legislation, it is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive property is reduced regardless of the impact of the ageing municipal tax system.”
“But this may lead to some foreign investors reluctantly buying real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class property, which is above 5-10 per cent of the price of the housing market, grew to 11.8 per cent last year in the rich south-west London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savils, prices in central London continued to show a sustainable growth of 5.6% in annual calculation, but were blocked by an active domestic market with high prices in the southwest, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movement of the dog’s tail is related to its mood.
Early studies have shown that sufficient dogs are pushing the tail to the right (from the dog’s standpoint), while alarmed dogs are pushing the tail to the left.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tail-fighting and react to them.
Professor George Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain have a different role to play in the formation of triggers that cause positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we've tried to look at this in other ways.
He added that like man, dogs have the right part of the brain to control the left side of the body and vice versa, and two semisanitaries play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the various fertilizations of other dogs, researchers observed animals when watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analysed their behavior.
Maybe we'll soon find out why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs video with dogs either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other damaging factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When animals saw that the rest of the unexpressed dog was driving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the flying dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was mainly on the left (again from the viewpoint of the dog’s tail), their heart was pounded and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigara said he did not think that the dogs had deliberately interacted with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience about the movements they should be concerned about and not about.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often the pouring of their tails on one side is related to more friendly behaviour, and the right hand gives less friendly behaviour, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether dogs were relevant to the left and right sides.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads left if they looked at an aggressive dog and right if they looked at a good dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the dog when the drop of her tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, to the contrary in relation to Italian research.”
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robots as dogs.
He explained that it could be a useful study of how dogs react to these dogs.
“While there is sufficient evidence to show that two half-carcases of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and the dog is not an exception,” he said.
However, in view of the ease with which their conduct may be recorded, we may soon come to understand why their tails sometimes turn to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys hold a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist had been diagnosed with laringitis.
This Chief Field Group should have been speaking on the city concert site of Hydro on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s condition made them take the show.
This group statement was made after it had been forced to postpone the concert to LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In their official Arctic Monkeys website, they reported: “After deciding to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after treatment with Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed at Hydro Square to Glasgow on Friday, 1 November.”
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with “laringit”, and unfortunately he was unable to speak.”

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring in the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest church in the Catholic Church after the pope, and that is why they choose the pope, so France will appoint their first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old Cardinal, he no longer participates in the election of the pope, which is the privilege of the group of 120 “elector cardinals”.
In declaring this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that the gathering of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistency, would take place before the ceremony was held.
“Dad Francisk decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consortium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero, from the Catholic vote organization, said that the number of electorate cardinals would likely be reduced by February.
He said that the pope usually calls the cardinals as much as it takes to bring the number of electorate cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
The Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since France was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and in particular in favour of Italy.
“It would be interesting to see if a new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a zero number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, the pope decided on his own.
“Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that “it is possible” that France would address the cardinals after the council.
But we haven't been in this situation before, all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually put in the position of cardinal of the bishops from large incomes, but France “half of the surprises, so we don’t know who he will call. ”
GM takes off a number of new U.S. peaks to finish back seats
General Motors Co has almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra model 2014 to address the problem of hand-adjusted seat backrests, according to a US regulatory notification on Friday in the field of road safety.
On some of the peaks, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not conform to the federal safety standards of motor vehicles by head restraints.
“In the case of a car hit behind the head restraint, drivers and passengers may not be adequately protected by increasing the risk of injury”, says the National Road Safety Administration website.
Those models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM pickups started in June and is the most important vehicle launch for the leading American auto manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed peak owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to consider notifying owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the sales of cars in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra peaks, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, grew by approximately 20 per cent over the first 10 months of this year, as GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares in the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday until $37.47.
Crying of Obama's voter's despair
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the opposition of the Republicans to make no commendable efforts.
Obstacles can not serve to justify problems with the web site reformed by Obama's health system, unmanned attacks
The 2008 Obama Campaign Memories are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a graduate of the Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me at the time of my second degree in medicine and give me a sense of hope.
It is called the Terrible for Victory, and it is a memoir for the 2008 Presidential Campaign of Barak Obama.
When I finish writing reports about my patients and lying in bed tonight, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could catch the spirit.
The victory of the elections was impressive, and the leading news programmes were taking a break to think about this historic moment.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
The White House should have been a young team of strategies, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a gross awakening, as a withdrawal from the dream.
It is hard to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I left my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the available medical assistance law to the withdrawal of our Iraqi soldiers, the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, do not speak”, the murder of Usama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party opposition has blocked too much of our country's progress: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and co-workers, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Obstacles to Republicism cannot explain the permission to hear foreign leaders or to strike innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of dissidents revealing wrongful acts of the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar Al-Avlaki without a court and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of public funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are “only aggressive... since the administration of Nixon”.
And recently, he cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Health Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the work of the elected post is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by events such as the New Town massacre.
Nevertheless, all the examples listed above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was a prisoner of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romni was an unmistakable and cruel alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of future elections, was justifying the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me twitch on the many promises I have made.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton put Obama to a deafening blow in the first elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting to analyze the causes of the failure, he told his staff that they should return to the normal course and remain faithful to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Deputy Billionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in childcare leave, because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnet, which has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when it tried to get away from the question of whether it had a conflict.
The Combined Party of Palmer may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbota's daughters would personally win from political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters become pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they will receive leave,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer as the winner of the Sanshein-Cost of the Ferfax electoral district with a vote of 53 votes after the re-enactment.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the electoral counting procedure to accelerate this process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why don't we have a system like that to come in, put your data on the computer, immediately vote out and get the result at 18:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer was also critical of the use of stamps in the bulletins.
That's because they can lose the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of karandas in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is considering the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59-year-old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshine-Cost and he would be “very serious” to his new work.
The public office is a public service.
“We do not get any prizes except thanks to history, because at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed two traders from its currency operations department, according to the information provided by two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification by the regulators of the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world ' s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations involving the world ' s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be removed during the ongoing investigation, which is being called into question by the LiBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
In refusing to comment on the removals, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from the regulators.
“Our ongoing investigation is continuing, and we are working fully with FCA and other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, respondents said that RBS transmitted e-mails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and, as far as he knows, was granted leave to his current post as head of the European spot trade in the JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, the senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's Emergency Communications Contact Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed persons.
This week, UBS reported that it had taken action against some of its staff after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating the alleged manipulations in the currency market in several Swiss banks.
At least six world regulators — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Authority Weko, FCA, the United States Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are considering allegations that the bankers have agreed to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said the person familiar with the situation.
Banks are watching instant communications and e-mails for a few years in search of offences.
News of the verifications has accelerated traders in the field of activities that have been one of the major sources of income for investment banks in recent years, which this year, however, has faced difficulties as the low volatility of currencies has reduced favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is virtually impossible to manipulate a large and high-liquid currency market, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came the same day as the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the traders from its London Stock Exchange's stock market this week after it had caused losses of almost $6 million last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader was acting alone and that this issue was managed to be localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the Barack Obama Health Act was constitutional, which was a major victory for Obama ' s administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges decided that certain provisions of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Access to Health requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance by 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s powers of taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also retained the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act to increase compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid programme by states, otherwise losing all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
The application to block the bill was submitted by 26 states and by the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law strongly opposed each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romni.
Soccer is the cause of the difference?
Within the Open Tribunal, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions was the banning of football in the North Caucasus, because of this game some scandals and divisions.
Speaker Sergey Narishkin recalled the recent developments in Biruleva and said that policies and media must be adjusted in order to reduce the “tension level in society”.
He probably meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of the TV broadcasters threatened to surround the Caucasians with a coil if they didn't want to limit birth...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples of Russia, which gave the discussion a summary.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryuleva were "model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and institutions for these questions" and seven young children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time has been practiced by migrants in Europe, has, in the opinion of the public, been flawed and must seek its way.
The historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new single textbook of history.
"There is still a need to create the cultural heritage of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Daguestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zuganov suggested that you be given a criminal responsibility for the "call for Russia's dissolution": "If you say on the U.S. radio that Alaska should be handed over to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists of causing ill and acute national problems to the public debate: "Is there anything to say about the dust of controversy?"
The leader of the "One Russia" party, Vladimir Vasiliev, here advised journalists to close the "paper" and agree to have discussions on the subject in a precise manner, and then the same commitments could be made by policies.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration and a general order, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that entrusted regional and municipal authorities with responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Manmila Andrikenko did not share this law: she had no clear idea that it was an adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and boundaries.
Thus, subjects will be treated differently in terms of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, and they do not have the means to make the methodological recommendations that they could use.
The Head of the Committee on Nationality of Gadjimet Safaraliev has proposed the establishment of a special agency called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy.
But Valerie Tischkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is sufficient to have a special person at the federal level, a “Minister without a portfolio”, to whom one could address if so.
"We are going to the edge, the tools are coming close, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work must receive worthy information support," said the representative of the CPR on the links with the society of Allevold Chaplin.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in his view, not be.
Here, Oleg Nelov brought a discussion to an unexpected conclusion: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Daguestan still need to be sought, but they are pushed not on that path, not on that path," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags are burning, and the friends throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There's another kind of sport called Regby...
"There will be no equal to them in the world in this kind of sport!" said the horrid man.
There will be no one to play in the rug at the Caucasian!
You're still offering them a Kerling!
You need to know the national characteristics, but it's just like offering a truck called the Firefly...
In Yaroslava, the local club was distinguished by the wild behavior of the Tribunals.
Football will have to ban all over the country...
The head of the disciplinary committee of the RFS, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that "Cuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles and transferred from the House of Football to the "SE" correspondent Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions for the Red Cross Club were applied to the fire of the Daguestan flag by the patients on the rostrum during the 14th Tour home match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the FPL.
We've examined all the available materials.
Because of the wrongful behavior of the Cubans, 500 thousand rubles were fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims Nortel
The group with thousands of former Nortel patents filed a whole series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, which it was awarded at the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, filed claims for a violation of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key search words on the Internet with their advertising, says the search engine, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on Google’s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel an initial price of $900 million for patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, ultimately offering $4.4 billion.
He lost Nortel's patents at Rockstar Consortium, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly a patent library for Motorola.
“In spite of an unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents for the subject of an application, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court said.
Rockstar is demanding an increase in Google's damages because he claims that the violation of Google's patent rights is intentional, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes an oath
Mohammed Morsi takes an oath, but his celebration will hardly mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he swore to be the first freely elected president of the country, replaced by Hosni Mubarak, who was defeated 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of the State in Egypt about 60 years after the overthrow of the monarchy.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Mursi at a Christmas ceremony shown in a direct atmosphere on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which was most of the 84 years of its existence banned by an organization that served as a target for violent actions by changing governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Morsi arrived with a small cortex shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and unlike the President ' s time pump Mubaraka, the movement was stopped only for a short time in order to miss his bus stop along the usually reinvigorated road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi laughed as a non-harististic “save wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to introduce himself as a candidate not only of the Islamists, but also of all those who wanted to bring to an end the case of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in the covered wooden panels of the hall where he took the oath.
Later, Mursi went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his opening speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that had completed a state gym during which he stood on the stand “silent”.
There was a military officer, Field Marshal Huseen Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People — One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of the university's main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a world education unit, the University of Cairo in 1970 became a community of Islamic student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a uprising concluded last year by the authoritarian regime of Mubarak and promised to restore the authority of the President, whose office was deprived of his office by the military council of cases taken by the defeated leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, he is carrying out the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The word Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
A special meeting of the Tumen Association of Engineers was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Motor Factory.
The event presented a new line for the production of steel tubes.
As said by the Commercial Director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel construction market was conducted in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric tubes per month.
It was subsequently decided to change the factory ' s profile and to install equipment for their production.
More than 7,000 tonnes of production have already been released this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million rubles, said Dennis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, allowing for an increase in the range.
The plant produces both a small tube profile, which is used for the heating industry, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to go to the production level of 50,000 tonnes of production per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
Retraining is being carried out and the necessary specialists are being selected from existing ones.
The following year, a new long-lasting cutting unit is planned to become a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the productivity of the product as well as another state, with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the companies are going to acquire tubes that are used in housing and community.
The company's management is tasked with closing down to 70 per cent of the requirements of the Timorese area in this product.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressed production managers, advised greater attention to modernization of machinery.
This is also the case in the form of State support for the industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
For this purpose, 150 million rubles have been allocated in the current year, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The last commission, which will consider the grant contracts, will adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget compensates for the costs of participation of local producers in international trade marks.
For the coming year, the budget provides for 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans to purchase new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the stockpiles, 3 million to energy conservation programmes.
There is a reduction of 72 million rubles for the reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment in the south of the Tumen district for the oil complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support will be discontinued in the future, as it was the reason for the introduction of the tax on mining of useful fossils paid by oil companies in the area budget.
They are not currently doing so, and subsidies are becoming the region ' s direct cost commitments.
In this regard, the Government considers the priority areas to be direct support for industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil sector through them.
The budget will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the oil situation.
Subsidies to equipment purchased by them are a competitive advantage for the South Timorese industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian average band, where the cheaper labour force will be.
In addition, there is an unclear question about the succession of the new owner of TNC-VR, Rosnefte, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumeni companies.
The agreement to implement the project expires in 2013, and applications for extension have not been made.
South enterprises that specialize in equipment for the oil sector are currently unable to form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil source in the Kuwaiti region will be charged to the region ' s budget, or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the oil.
Tomic is working 240 hours for an extremist role in the Socset
Tomska, the Lenin District Court sentenced to 240 hours the mandatory work of the city ' s residents, who had posted an extremist video network, informed the RIA Novosti on Friday, a representative of the District Court Press Service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man placed a video on his page on the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In this regard, a criminal case was initiated under article UC RF “activities aimed at incitement to hatred and hostility, as well as at undermining the dignity of the public.”
“The Lenin District Court has dealt with this case in a special manner and has found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by appointing a 240-hour mandatory sentence,” said the Agency's interviewer.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians to charge the price of goods after the signing of the association with the Euro Union
Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said that during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should be reduced.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," said Azarov.
As for other goods, the effect of the price agreement will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there must also be no price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently shown up enough in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite so, or if it is more accurate - it is not so," said Azarov.
Investigators are checking information on ill-treatment of the child in Biscay
On 29 October, the media reported that the educator of one of the children ' s gardens in Bijska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
All circumstances are currently being identified by investigators, as well as legal evaluation of the actions of child workers.
After the indictment of Evgenia Vasilev's stupidity, she spoke
Evgenia Vasileva, a person almost a year with a media focus, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press on both thefts in Minoband and personal relations with former Defence Minister Anatoli Serdjukovi, her poetry and passion for valuables.
However, on 1 November, a figure in the Ombudservis case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasileva, he said: "It was, of course, an equal task to extract any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail for me to testify, otherwise I would be put in prison.
To this day, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of victory.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that most people in Vasileva have said that she does not care about the taste.
A statement by the official representative of SC RF Vladimir Markin is likely to indicate that the counterfeits have been found in the collection of paintings collected by the Obandservis figure.
Among the things that have been arrested are a number of paintings that the owner, being convinced of his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the masterpieces of the world’s paintings.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, in simple terms, were cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minobanda, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just an infinity," says Vasileva.
On the issue of whether she admitted her guilt at least in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vasileva said: " Of course not.
Admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in this regard.
They're just leading people astray, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC RF that Vasileva is turning away from the study of the criminal case, the lawyer said that he and his client “did not let the investigator know of the case”.
What was the reason for the disclosures by the house arrester Vasiliev, who has not yet been in contact with the press?
How could a woman not respond to the accusation in a bad way?
Or is it the rights of journalists who claimed a few days ago that she had “entered into an even greater trance under house arrest” due to reports of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov with her wife and his return to the family?
In his article "Sedjukov has returned to a woman?", a well-known military "KP" viewer, Victor Baranec, wrote: "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative in questioning."
In the past, some accusations were made by Vasilev regarding the illegal sale of the real estate of Minobūda.
Premise guys.

Do you think the tourists went to the Internet in the past?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its forecast of full year income and expects record revenue from resters in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism company is now expecting its principal full annual income to be from $325 to $340 million, compared with the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current orientations are achieved, this will be a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the record income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Grem Turner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent of its income in the first half of the year and started the second half with good indicators, especially on Sunday visits to Australia and the United Kingdom.
“For the period from the beginning of the year, we have been working on our 10 countries’ profits, and some of them are expected to have a record high income before the deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“It comes from Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, business so far in the second half of the year has recovered, which offset a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the long-term business of Flight Centre went well, while corporate customers lost less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to receive income for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares grew by 3 cents until $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police found two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on the Street of the Extreme.
At the time of the check, the game went into the facility.
There were 24 cars in the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The UMD of Russia on Barnaulu reports that administrative material has been produced under the article “illegal organization and gambling”.
Technically, they got it.
In the near future, information on the facts will be sent to the courts of the city ' s Industrial and Leninist districts.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has been ill-treated with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the New Region in the U.S.M.M.R. Press Service on the Sverdlovsk area, two women ' s bodies were found after a fire in a three-room apartment on the streets of Uralski, the next day in the city of Kirov in the region of Uralski.
The persons killed were soon identified.
It was found that they were sisters, one of whom was a resident of Ekaterinburg 44 years old, the other 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
They burned the apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was personally controlled by the chief police officer of the Mikhail Borodin region.
The internal affairs authorities draw up different versions of the murder, check the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established what purpose women had taken off the apartment and where they had lived before what they had done with whom they had had relations.
Schools called for more attention in mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, the 19th - century novel, Romantic poetry, and modern British literature since 1914.
The examination will also include “extraprogramme texts”, to promote more extensive reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to submit a separate language graduation exam, with strong recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education must issue new education programmes on English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other main items next year.
The individual regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure for secondary school graduation exams, with a new system of evaluations and a lower level of course work.
Speaking in summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gow said that there was “a broad consensus that we should reform our exam system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year or three hours a week during a quarter) than in most countries.
To compare, Australian schools spend an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore students take about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement to allocate more time to the math schedule would not be available, the coalition sources said that large school graduations on mathematics combined with the higher rating rate in the rating table would most likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets in Hayhe will be held by tourists in 2,200 rubles
From now on, from Blagovestensk to Haye tourists will begin to transport ships on the airbag.
For those wishing to travel to China, this means additional losses
The ticket on the puma is traditionally worth much more than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the cost of the ordinary ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
The tour through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
To put it this season, the tickets did not travel; at the same price, the pumps drove tourists and last spring, and the year back in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate RF is insufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that RF's growth rate is insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
This year, we planned GDP growth in the region of 3%, perhaps even more.
You'll actually hear less than 2 per cent.
In the background of the recession in a number of countries in Europe, it would not be very bad, but it is small for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important for Russian companies, Russian businesses, to receive normal loans at a normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," stressed the head of the Government.

Travel on land, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team run almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so much in this West African country is only one per 5,000 people
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become the hero of the year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle had seen his father return to life and had returned to a state of unconsciousness, riding on hospitals that had not been properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle suffered a car crash in 1981 near Yaounde, Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, for years Bwelle accompanied her father to overcrowded hospitals and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“It’s not easy,” said Bwell.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle finished in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor of 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could contact a doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the closet.
Two out of five people in that country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his fellowmen, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a paramedic at Yaounde Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-commercial organization, which organizes rural trips to the countryside to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are in the vans, attaching medical supplies to roofs, and going to the crossroads to visit those in need.
They don't always have luck.
They often had to push cars through rivers and debris.
But when they arrive, they meet them like these heroes: a festival with songs and dances and the best places the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwelle, with his extensive smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the party.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the districts within 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-out clinics provides various medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive churches, gifted glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
After dinner, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, a municipality or a house; after the procedure, patients stand up and go to the post-operative area to free the room for the next person.
Using the generator to light up operational and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning of the morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade’s zeal usually helps to support village musicians.
“They fight in the drums all night, so that we can be smart and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the brigade members return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of enormous importance to those they assist.
One man explained that he would be allowed to work again if he had received a free treatment.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions, surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
This is the second work, he said, which provides 60 per cent of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwelle group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melli, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity of practice that they would never have received at home.
“We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove Friday blood or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a high school student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transportation and training pays Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent load of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live happy lives, to fulfill this promise to their father is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snouden agreed to testify about Merkel's interrogation
Ambassador Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FRG's Office of Public Prosecutors in the case of a possible hearing of the U.S. chancellor's phone.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Kitt Alexander, has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to specify clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are beginning to take action in response to a scandal involving US spy programs.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Office.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makej at a press conference following a meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, correspondent for BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two-country public administrations will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts," said Vladimir Makej.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the 8th regular meeting of the joint intergovernmental economic commission of Belarus and Turkey had been held in Ankara, resulting in the signing of the protocol.
The Parties developed a road map of Belarus-Turkey cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Policy Office, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as to find new forms and ways of interaction.
“The protocol of the last meeting is fully implemented, and I am confident that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other to be reliable partners,” he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that the two countries ' Heads of Foreign Affairs had decided in the negotiations to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Traffic between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, is expected to increase and lead to a figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is no potential to be used in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions for trade and economic links and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey will also be established," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama renounces his words of health
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama made a rather frequent, clear promise yesterday that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notifications of termination of services from their providers, the Republicans have recently criticised the President for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few of his initial public promises.
“Most people with health insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
Referring to what he referred to as a “new life” on the termination of services, Obama called upon the recipients of these notifications to seek other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the available medical care law.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who promotes the implementation of the available medical assistance law, said that the launch of the internet sales site was going “freakingly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and upset just like everyone else,” she said.
“I really want to return your trust.”
An angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which caught an intruded microphone sitting behind her at yesterday ' s hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billy Long, a member of the state of Missouri, on whether she was obliged to join Obama ' s health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Sibelius once again urged him to say why the “architect” of the available medical assistance law had not voluntarily renounced the government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt lost media status for non-censorship defense
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to accept an invalid license for the registration of Rosbalt, which is written by Lenta.
In the absence of a media agency, Rosomnadzor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was created during the trial: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue the right to object.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also operate missions in countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had been listed as the most popular private media in Russia.
However, Rosbalt has always been quite specific: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and are still) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the agency ' s existence.
Although Rosbalt had a wide range of sources in various agencies, it was also said that the project was headed by Natalie Chaplin, the wife of Victor Churchess.
However, the role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt Guide to the End is unclear: it is most often referred to as “the project manager”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief of Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been listed in federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place in the Russian media website review on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience on rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand visits), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are notes of Kremlin's inability to deal with Ukraine, the death of the soloist King and Shot team, the riots in the capital of Biruleva.
The Rosbalta conflict with Rosconnadsor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law prohibited non-censorship by journalists entered into force.
The report found a prohibited lexicology in two videos published on the website of the video agency ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil peaks").
The following parties describe different situations.
On the basis of the video findings, Rosbalt accused the media of gross and systematic violation of the law and appealed to the court for a licence to the agency.
In Rosbalte it was stated that the claims were wrong: first, the roles were not editorial material, second, the mother's words were masked in them, and, thirdly, immediately after the roll warning had been removed from the site.
Representatives of the Agency complained about the claims of Rosomnadzer in the world court - and when Mosgord accepted the request of Rosomnadzer on 22 October 2013, these complaints continued.
However, 25 world judges have already taken a decision not in favour of Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanova has been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and has been fined for 20,000 rubles - 10,000 per roll.
Obviously, that would have prejudged the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud, if you give up thinking that the outcome could have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to accept an invalid certificate for the registration of Rosbalta, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
It can't be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported Members of the House (the statement on behalf of the head of Rosamnadzor Alexander Jarov signed 26 members on 10 October; the document itself was submitted at the CRC initiative).
The publication was wrongly closed by the head of the Russian Union of Journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roscomnadsur even provided him with certain assurances that the case would not come before the revocation of the licence.
The Rosbalt Court has shown that the media in Russia is safer under whose jurisdiction today is the big issue.
Syria has destroyed weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacities, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament in Damascus was completed within one day ' s time limit.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of combatants for use, transmitted by the BBC.
The destruction of the most toxic stocks or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in Damascus on 21 August during the chemical attack, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to manufacture more weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for the mixing of chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be carefully monitored so as not to allow them to rest.
The next milestone is mid-November: OPCW and the Syrians should thus agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new inspection facilities if there is reason to suspect that Damascus has not been discovered.
It is believed that this shot was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case with the Syrian rebels.
The world community called for the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or render ineffective all the capacities for the production of gas and liquids and for the filling of the weapons.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step must be the destruction of the Syrian chemical army.
The arsenal is expected to contain more than 1,000 tonnes of neuroparalytic toxic substances, each natural gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several tens of different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action to begin, which takes two weeks.
The head of OZHO field operations, Jerry Smith, said that his inspectors had been “personally monitoring the destruction of equipment”.
“They now have no possibility of further production or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors have visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and that the facilities for the production of weapons and toxic substances have either been destroyed or have been brought into disrepute.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, says the document, but the equipment has been transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “especially difficult”, as work had to be done in the context of ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time for inspectors to celebrate it before it was found that they were too busy to work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the U.S. spy “has gone unpopularly away”
John Kerry demonstrated a weakening of the U.S. tracking programme protection tactics, unpredictably recognizing that in some cases the U.S. espionage “has gone unpopularly away”.
The Secretary-General also acknowledged that it was his fault, along with Barack Obama, that he had been “in the autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden's loud disclosures about ANB's spy activities.
This leak of information has been placed by the U.S. Government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video during an open governmental conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken up some of the things that are happening in the autopilot because such an opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to recognize that the United States espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases it has been unpleasant.
And the President is determined to shed light on the issue and explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one can feel abused.
I assure you, there is no injustice to the innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had acted with good motives and that his follow-up operations had saved many lives.
He said, “We are working in a new world, in which people are about to explode.
There is radical extremism in the world, an unreasonable and complete determination to kill people, to blow up people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to catch it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented crashing planes, explosions of buildings and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
In the meantime, US legislators will go to Europe to help resolve the alleged US spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of Connecticut Chris Merfie said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to cease their participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment of the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is really important for Europeans to remain our supporters for our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Murphy, a first-time democracy that is chaired by the International Senate on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these ANA programmes.”
News that ANB has collected millions of phone records in Europe has deteriorated relations with some U.S. allies, although the Agency ' s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden showing that the ANA was monitoring the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, protected the Spanish activities against allies as necessary and said it was a normal case on both sides.
In the background of this forest, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and chambers would join the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some “hardness from the best incentives” would also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they themselves have used for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect European rights, they must also agree that we are not the only ones who are involved in intelligence,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should be sent to these outposts in the Middle East and in Poland to address the hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to US intelligence activities.
The new composition of the public observation commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Board of Public Chambers (OPs) can adopt new compositions of the Public Observatory Commissions (OICs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote was adopted, lobbyists would increase their influence.
ONC is a public structure that controls the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The case of Sergey Magnitski and Leonida Razuzzaev, the riots in the Copia colony, which is the UN, has been reported by most of the resonance events on the grid.
Control of the ONC is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of rapists.
At the OPC working group meeting, I proposed to make the selection of human rights experience a criterion.
"They didn't take it, they didn't make lists, they didn't make criteria," says Valerie Borschev.
The present President of the Moscow Observatory and the Association of Independent Observers is the All-Russian human rights defenders in prison.
As a member of the House of the Apple, he had drafted a law governing the activities of the UNC.
The OP Board should vote for the membership of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
At 1,800 vacancies were claimed by fewer than a thousand desirables, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balcaria competitions were unable to organize due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a selection of vacancies.
ONC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borscheva, in the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 rapists, and in the version voting in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted into the capital commission.
That's why the representative of the "God's Brotherhood" Wiacheslav Kalinin can be re-entered.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borstev believes that the rapists, by appointing their chairman of the UNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of rapists is coordinated by the member of the ONC Anton Zvetkov, who is headed by the “Russian Officers”, an organization that defends the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies all over the track," said RBC Daily Anton Zvetkov.
He denied that he was lobbying for any listings and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Zvetkov, he was not even interested in what list they are now voting in the OP.
The publication of Borsche information is considered a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change in the leadership of the Chelabinian UNC.
Her former leaders will be removed because of last year's Copie riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the management of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ONC Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to rapists.
Out of the new lists, the human rights defender of the local commission was “lost” because he was one of his opponents, although in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for non-ethical conduct.
The lists of the Borschev Moscow and Growth Commissions are considered to be "a place for Copejsk".
The revelations of the Hope of Tolokonnik did not affect the ONC Mordov, which they considered to be “violent”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new team, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
A member of the Board of the OP Nikolai Svanidze told the RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list because he was upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on OP Pavel Gusev said he voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He co-ordinated the list of UNOC, Deputy Secretary of the OP, Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.

The mushroom shall not be required to predict the outcome of the vote of the Board of Governors.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified option will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against a prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 per cent of the Phucket prison for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed a sentence and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bemford was initially recognized by the Phucket Provincial Court on 15 June as guilty of a false charge after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had detained her.
However, it was later found that she had returned to her hotel well after her Australian boyfriend had broken up.
The Phucket police interrogated Bemford for two days before she admitted that she had manufactured this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police chambers.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term at the centre of the general regime in the province of Phuketa, not in a female prison for adults.
She is the daughter of former Australian player Peter Tanks, who called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” about the well-being of her daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“It’s obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bemford appealed his sentence and was released in 50 000 bits.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently taking her vacation in the Krabi district in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bemford was currently a local lawyer in Phucket, but warned that the appeal could result in a court-martial extending its sentence to two years and forcing her to be held in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian Turgent Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he could also seek to restore his damaged tourist image, which would result in a justifiable sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel Eltisheva, translated into French.
Remember, this novel became the finalist of four awards: "The Clear Pole", "Russian Bucker", "National Bestseller" and "The Great Book".
And last year, the author of the book was awarded a prize to the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the unmistakable leader of the present generation of thirty-year-olds and forty-year-olds.
Practically every publication of its hard stories and stories, built on modern life stories and stories, has caused heated disputes among critics of different directions.
It can be argued that the joint article on the prose and publicism of Sencina, reviews of its books and journals create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the works of “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, critic Sergei Chuprinin said that most of them understood the word “literature” as seen not only in the present and future of our vocabulary but also in our lives.
Unfortunately, most of the articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere have not been included in the book.
The analytical and review articles are usually given in the reduction in the section “Abzaci..."
