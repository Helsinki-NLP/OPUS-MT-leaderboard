FANO Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will, together with RAN, hold the third Expert Session “Assessing the performance of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in the press release, which is in the version “Lenta.Ru”.
At the third meeting, the outcome of the Expert Session is planned for the year and the final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the evaluation.
The third expert session will be the final event on the development of a single approach for all three academia to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in doing this, and the final version of the normative documents is being agreed upon.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the expert and analytical board of FANO of Russia, Elena Axenov.
Representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
As a result, the resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. in Moscow on 16 September 2014 at: Moscow City, Soljanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to find family stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the turbulence and its influence on chemical uniformity in constellations.
It is expected that the opening of the professionals will allow them to look for relatives among the stars, that is, from one cluster.
The results of their studies have been published in the journal Nature and can be accessed briefly on the university website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is the turbulence of the gas clouds prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if the birth star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition allows it to determine the place of birth and the region of education of the star-born.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives outside the cluster.
The modelling results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer specialists have modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together form a cloud.
This object has been transformed into a cluster of protostars for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added adhesives to the initial gas flows and have found that the rapid turbulence in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysics, their study proves that it is possible to search for chemical-related stars and identify possible regions of the education of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after the high-speed motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was confiscated after being transported to a speed of 125 km/h to a speed limit of 70 km/h and through Bushland to hide from the police in Pilbara.
The transport police patrol in Carrate this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, finding its speed reached 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcyclist had not stopped and continued his journey to Burgess Road, then returned to Bushland, which led to the loss of sight by the police.
The motorbike and the driver's description were observed near the house at Wolcott Wey in Bulgaria.
The Carrata police accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and take a dangerous course.
It must be brought before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not be “door-to-door” due to new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "stop the door" due to new sanctions.
Today, the head of the MID RF Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of the IGIMO, stated this.
In view of our response to the new wave of anti-Russia sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will look like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the guy's door, some kind of whipping, falsely understood, as the Minister stressed.
We will, above all, be distracted from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of the partners for their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is very good to judge what partners are seeking - the chapter of the MIDI RF continued.
If they say "they'll be sick for us, too, but we have to go to Russia to punish," that's probably not enough."
With regard to the WTO exit of RF in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we want to develop WTO instruments more actively, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome, as we believe, the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is being accused of dumping and is using anti-dumping measures against the sectors of the RF economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the impossibility of applying the EU's third energy package rules retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How is it right to use cheese in design now?
Questions answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the cheese loses its main appeal after blooming, it is desirable to be planted with other artists.
It is beautifully intertwined with many cultures.
With cheese, both plants that are decorative at other times and that are colourful at the same time can be added.
Another addition to the cheese is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form its trunk tree of different heights, improved with a piece, a piece with a wide foundation, and even a garden bunsai - a tree with a wonderfully burnt stem.
Just choose the form that matches your design more now.
In Karelija, a resident of Leningrad City is sentenced for the sale of counterfeit money
As reported in the Republican MVD, the man engaged in his criminal activity in the Olonec and Segage areas.
In addition to Kareli, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting the Volo-Golden area, where he had been sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment this spring.
The man later appeared before the Olonica District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it has been carried out in Segage.
The investigation has shown that there are several episodes of counterfeiting in the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of the current year, criminal case files were sent to court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with that of the general regime.
The sentence has not entered into force legally.
Remember, two other counterfeit money dealers were convicted last week at Petroswadska’s stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Kareli from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four years.
A fine of 500 thousand rubles is assigned to each.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, Dervis, was observed in Archangelia.
The meeting, which was held in the district centre, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
The Archangelic Memorial was held in the cornerstone of the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the coast of Sedova in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of Veteran Archangelian organizations, children of the Cadets.
For the first time, we met twenty - three years ago when a stone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned to the sea," said the president of the Council of Veterans of the North Sea Pass Boris Karpov.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and cadette class educators gave the veterans flowers and marched with the Russian flags and the name of the Victory.
The meeting ended with the flowers attached to the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tonnes of rubber, 1,500 tonnes of formal footwear, lead, shear and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, including 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikain destroyers, in a depleted state.
At the same time, the convoys consisted of 16 British WMF ships, of which two were aircraft.
The caravan of vessels was not found by the opponent and successfully reached the destination of the Arkangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport ships and about 50 warships were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill on which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions, there and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, who is co-chair of the Congress of the Progressive Group.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Extension of the Rights of Workers along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination against the organization of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of opposers of trade unions.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Act in such a way as to enable workers who are discriminated against to participate in trade unions, to seek justice in civil courts, and to receive compensation for damages and fines, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to find out what Ellison, Luis and co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite recent attacks by trade unions, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states around the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labour rights.
It was a time for millions of Americans to remember when that country had at the same time protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to an organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Todzi was replaced by democracy.
Recognizing fully that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to an organization and to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the Fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to undermine that right will not have legal force; measures aimed at that purpose will be regarded as illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which had made up the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the sponsors included the guarantee that “every person has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
In the generations of the Americans, the basic provision was that labour rights were human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to the organization of trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to an organization and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Younger said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history will remember them.
History remembers how we should.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - has long grown.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reinvigorating the ideals that have historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this, which was signed in June by Governor Louisiana Bobby Jinadl and had to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who performed abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to the hospital within a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such authority.
“The complainants will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise their powers,” said Judge John DeGreevells in his decision.
The hearing will be held during the month in which the judge will issue a more permanent decision under the law.
The rights defenders of abortions were happy to see this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“Today’s decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from the law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a request for the suspension of the law from three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision was made by doctors from two clinics who did not speak to the claimants in this case and also made a statement of acceptance.
Louisiana is a member of 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such unconstitutional measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas Act, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
The right to abortion, together with the U.S. College of Nurses and Gynecologists and the U.S. Medical Association, is said to impose restrictions on doctors who are not medically required.
Abortionists argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the right to hospital admission, the Centre for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop the procedure, the group reported.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors until their statements of authority were pending.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of commercial networks must be Russian production, the Deputy of the House of Justice of Russia considers Oleg Nile.
The Parliament prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, which is written in the Newspaper.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
This concerns products that are not produced in Russia. "...> According to the other groups of products produced in Russia, the riteiller will have to provide at least half of its parcels to domestic producers," said the Nile.
Together with the amendments to article “On the basis of public regulation of trade in FR”, the bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, which sets the reduced rate of VAT to 10 per cent for the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent share in commercial networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
A few times more domestic goods will appear on the catches.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer, Nlogovic, a member of the independent expert centre, Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will have a positive effect and will lead to growth.
In addition there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the knights because they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenue, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some faster implementation will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, indeed not immediately," the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian companies had often been unable to catch local stores because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo was introduced, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and health checks on the Russian market, food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be supplied.
In other words, it is now a moment of silence when the former games have gone away and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Nearly a month later, demand for domestic raw materials and prices for ready-to-growth products increased," said the first Vice-President of the Russian General Public Organization, "the Russian Financial Directors' Club", C.E. Tamar Kasianov.
However, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will help to strengthen the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other, not with goods that were cheap from the subsidies of another State.
In other words, the buyer ' s struggle will be spread among companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Cassianov notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of their compatriots far beyond all the articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "stretch" the share of Russian goods up to half the range.
In this context, there is growing fear that undeserved goods will be caught.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied in the form of manufactured in Russia," the expert added.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that will benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected as demand for their products will decrease.
Lithuania does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products can be imported analogues of quality, while stores will be able to generate prices for the second as a commodity.
In the early 2000s, the idea of replacing economists had been re discussed in February of this year because of the continued devaluation of rubles.
Now, in the light of difficult relations with the West, the issue of withdrawal from import products is becoming even more relevant.
The law requires that shipowners be treated as domestic producers when making orders to suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be set up in a shorter time," said Oleg Nile.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors, where the potential for particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover all the catches of Russian shops.
In addition, strong impulses can also produce meat.
As is known, the largest proportion of imports remain in cattle, from 30% to 35%.
It turns out 65-70% still belongs to Russian products," says Cassianov.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products would make it easier for imports and could speed up the process.
However, this initiative will not, in itself, replace itself, because it requires a set of measures, as Lithuania is convinced.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from the border, i.e. full imports will not take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, small quotas need to be established, and domestic production is still required in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas will be and will be provided as soon as possible," said the expert.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published videos of their dead mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia ' s rural areas face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than in cities.
Researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis was diagnosed.
Leading researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
NEXT RESEARCH: New medicines can slow the cancer of the ovaries and the cancer of the ovaries
Researchers have been following women’s medical pathway for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that women ' s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status had also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan assumed that a timely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecology, and they are mainly located in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distance, she assumed that an increase in the number of exit services would help professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were treated far away from home.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of the geographical situation, the study found that the life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast of Elise Niw said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will be opened in September in the Kužener region
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktybelak began in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was over 10 million rubles.
According to the management of public communications and information, the construction of the facility was financed from the Republican budget in accordance with the investment programme.
The total area of the treatment facility is nearly 230 square metres.
This will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktybelak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncherjumal, Tunisia, Fomichi, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaškajal.
The new field-care facility will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
Killed four-month-old in a state of unanxiety, the new-man will be brought before the court
The resident of Chowasia will be on the scene of the murder of his own child.
Cheboksar has completed an investigation into a criminal case involving a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarska who is accused of causing the death of an unwarranted person.
The result was that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with his four-month son, came to celebrate the birthday of her son-in-law in Cheboksara.
After a long stay, the New Yorker decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, the unconscious woman put him next to her to bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman assaulted her son, causing him to die of strangulation.
The criminal case, reported by the S.U.S.C.R. on Guardia, is sent to the court.
Inflation has left.
Do you feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of RF and West inflation in Russia will be accelerated and unintended by the authorities, convinced of the analysis of the TBB Capital.
Experts believe that the delayed impact of the sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, says RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014, and the following year and less than 6.5 per cent in 2014.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersantz, this week MER will have to make “small but principled” adjustments in the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the Authority could lower its inflation estimates for 2015, thus eliminating the expected growth in population income.
The forecast was that the food sanctions for RF were in effect for the year until August 2015.
How could such a situation be expected to be so high in inflation?
The current situation is a sudden shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minfin.
Economists from the TCB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic bloc for inflation and predict price increases in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will be combined with possible introduction in the RF Sales Tax (NSP) regions in 2015, convinced by experts.
Inflation peaks of 9 per cent will be due in February, followed by annual price increases, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstatt suffered the first inflation results after the RF imposed “accuracy sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and identified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the AForex FC Analysis Department:
Price increases are already being observed in the main product segments.
Moreover, when socially important products were valued, the Government had to launch systematic monitoring of price stability to prevent risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retellers are already reporting on a daily basis to the regulators, so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason the price increase is being initiated.
The high rates of capital flow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the refugee population into foreign currency, and the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia continue to be key factors in the growth of the consumer price index.
If inflationary pressures were to remain under control, the value of the basket of a minimum set of products would not increase by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food products has caused shock to the internal market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in the end-of-life value.
Since we are not fully able to launch the import replacement mechanism at the current stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the responsible sanctions will continue to bear the risk of inflationary growth.
If fiscal reasons related to lack of confidence in the national currency as well as poor prospects of economic growth are added, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Aleksandr Razwaev, Director of Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, and in zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think that after the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, managing UK assets "Fond Maguta"
The external factor related to sanctions against Russia as long as it has been successfully held back, but if there is further pressure on the financial sector, this can lead to some difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are traditionally reflected in cash purchases in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CB RF and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the rubble by both market and public regulation.
However, price increases have started traditionally after summer rest and may become more noticeable in this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is probably 7.5 per cent, as the RF still has financial stocks.
Rural centres are experiencing a decrease in the number of landowners
Such a fall, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of landowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the beginning of the loss of tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the “main growing age”, according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, the tenants spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on farming.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in high-urban areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courts in front of the parking lot and the reduction of sizes now as other factors threatening the sector, the annual sales of which is estimated to be £5 billion.
In the United Kingdom, where the number of landowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest cost per household farm.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting housing and the lack of space for now did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener at RHS, said: "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of diverse trade in fruit and vegetables as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has carried out mass cleaning at the Agriculture Fund
Three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
The official Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has only reported the removal from office of Executive Director Atanas Dobivo.
His place took Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had been quietly replaced on Friday.

Turkey challenges American diplomacy in connection with a spying report
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has created the country's highest-ranking American diplomat to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the US Commissioner for Affairs and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet Journal The Intercept reported that the documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden indicated that Turkey was a priority subject of intelligence for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reduced the importance of this message, saying that all lead countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported that the main intelligence agency in Germany had also made Ankara an object of exploration, provoked a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Major Chinese companies united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (socsets, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest searcher), are setting up a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
The Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, says the Wanda Group.
Registration is planned in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest in China, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 faeces, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and entertainment theme park in Cindao (a city in eastern China on the shore of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate $960 million in profits.
In addition, Wanda belongs to the American AMC Entertainment Holdings Movie Network, which makes the company the world's largest movie operator.
By 2015, Wanda was planning to equip all its commercial centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which would be the development of an Alibaba competitor.
According to Duncé, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Cae.
The essence of online-to-off-the-business (O2O) is to attract customers on the Internet so that they can go to regular online shops or purchase other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is the sales services of coupons of Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "prodig" in online commerce," said manager Wanda Van Zjanlin (Bloomberg quote).
“Now the O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation the chances are all about equal,” he said.
The Chinese Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and it is estimated that McKinsey & Co. will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has increased to 632 million, with Bloomberg producing official statistics: more people in any country of the world, except India.
And it is estimated that by 2015 this figure could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richer
Tencent Ma Huaten was China's richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg millionaires' index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma had already raised it to $5.5 billion.
The status of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is accounted for in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now the third of China's richest people, while Van Xianlin from Wanda is the fourth line in the rating.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: the three richest people are united in their efforts to challenge even more rich," Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce at Hanzhou Cao Lai, said.
But he thinks that the new company will hardly be able to compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba not only competes with not only new companies but also with the world-renowned leaders of the Internet trade shows a pre-published record of the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company has earned more than both of its American competitors together.
The net profit of Alibaba for the period is almost twice as high as the competitor's total - it has grown almost three times annually and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential for money generation, much thanks to its mobile applications," said Bloomberg, a Hong Kong Arete Research Service analyst.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile service users in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter were mobile devices.
Alibaba has to call the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on 16 September.
The road show, which preceded this event, starts on 3 September.
The Alibaba IPO exit is expected to become a record in NYSE history and will allow companies to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the United States stock exchange records have been made available to Visa's payment system, which in 2008 had made its initial placement, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the commercial networks must be Russian production, according to the Members of the House.
They have developed a bill on this subject.
These are amendments to article 8 of the FZ on the basis of public regulation of trade in RFs and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the draft law, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores should be per type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as winter fruits and vegetables, so they will be “disposed” to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amended the RF Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent reduction in the NDS rate for all food products originating in Russia, reports the Newspaper.
On 27 August, the lower House of Parliament introduced a bill to amend the "Differential Markets" Act, which proposes to re-establish farm markets in Russia where small producers will be able to implement their products.
Police chief Magalufa charged with corruption
The complainants presented evidence of extortion by the police and the officials of the municipality of Kalvia at the Office of Public Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the Kalvi police in the resort island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous center of the unscrupulous drink of Magalufe.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of the corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street on which most of Magaluf ' s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by the police and police officers of the municipality of Calvia at the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca for Combating Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard for corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism on the part of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be threatened.
There's nothing to lose.
Magaluf entered the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who took 24 men to the bar.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop hooliganism in an unrelenting state among the Magalufa resuscitators, bringing to a minimum the number of scandalous alcohol races at the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the Carnage Bar organizers were jointly fined €55,000 ($73000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British resters, was also the place of numerous accidents in the state of alcoholism associated with crazy entertainment, known as "balconing", when people dive from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of the spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, brought rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell at night on Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short waves with a bursting wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 evening and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the early part of the spring was released last week, the temperature again fell on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The poor conditions were expected to serve as one of the reasons for the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land on the schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it fell into the wind wave zone -- suddenly changing speed or wind direction at a short distance -- and was forced to rise.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to rise during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the trip led to the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates trip from Dubai and the Qantas trip from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rivers.
Calculation of construction facilities in the RF will be carried out on a new basis
Price formation, construction management and networking issues of the Federal Antitrust Service are under special scrutiny.
In FAS, an expert board on competition development was established in the field of construction.
At its meeting, the head of the control of ŽCH, construction and natural resources, FAS Wadim Soloviev, stated that “the current calculation of construction facilities is absolutely inconceivable”.
The normative base makes price formation opaque and can lead to an unwarranted cost of construction, considered in the FAS.
And they propose that the cost of building buildings at the design stage be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated standards and unit rates applied today for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the road map and are now under review in the Ministry.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation for construction of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Wadim Soloviev.
For now, every bolt and hook is calculated, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, untrustworthy construction companies can bury “the entire tractor”.
The Ministry with FAS agrees.
“The first calculations for the changeover in the value of the constructive elements already exist: methods for calculating the prices for constructive solutions have been developed, estimates of these indicators have been drawn up,” said the head of the Department of Urban Development and Architecture of Minister Elena Zjukova.
As a pilot, the road construction area is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest" Anatoly Demayanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed calculation of the constructive elements is concerned, this is difficult to realise in practice, since different technologies are often used in building construction,” he said.
It's not a secret that the building is developing in a lot thanks to the warrant.
In the opinion of the Chairman of the Government of NP, Ekaterina Lesin, the Expert Community of the Professionals, today the State is the most eligible customer.
The Director of Engineering of the Corporate Capital Building Centre, Rosatoma Vladimir Malachov, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided between the companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopolies and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could be possible only if access to contracts was most appreciated by someone in charge.
The expert board was invited to form the order system in such a way that the same executive could not obtain more than one contract of more than 1 billion dollars or several contracts of more than 1 billion dollars.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be assessed from the point of view of the impact on business and the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zjukov explained, the contracting authority would then have to be entrusted with the functions of the contractor, which would increase the number of staff of the contracting authority and the budgetary costs of its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer will have to have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the order organizations and their safety.
Often, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach could lead to the outflow of highly qualified bidders due to the lack of interest in obtaining a State order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The Prisons of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Procurement Institute, Alexander Eustashenkov, believes that the procurement procedure has now become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "A participant in the application must indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "analogue", "not below", "above", "may be", "may be", "may be", "may be", "at first", "not earlier", "not above", "not allowed" etc.
Thus, the clients often abuse their right to impose requirements for the content of the application submitted by the ordering organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Eustashenko, was the need to assess the quality of the work at the request stage through the participant ' s " paper" proposal.
In considering the participant's application, only the qualifications of the contractor can be really assessed, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when they are received.
The Expert Board was also invited to transfer the marginal income from the top to the bottom ash to remove intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, the Stats-secretary, the FAS locker Andrey Czarkovski believes that this is not worth the responsibility, since the order must be ordered by the agent.
Otherwise, it's going to be like in a well-known resurgence of the Arkadia Raykin Atele: "Do you have a claim for the cowards?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and rain mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed when the territory was restored after hostilities.
The beginning of school activities brought joy and excitement to the populations of southern Israel affected by the missile, but the consequences of the war remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the children's now "Pashos", where the missile was fired, removed the traces of the wall and the children's grief before the arrival of the students.
"We are a little scared, but we look forward to the future," said Ronit Bart, the resident of Kibuz Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a life of moderation.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was a second time that she started going to school "nearly weird."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibuk, located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement ended last week, thousands of border residents, such as Saad, had not left or left their homes, had left the Gaza Strip in safer areas to escape the missile and miner fire.
Many Nahal Oz residents, living near the border of Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, are doubtful that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderote, a city on the border with Gaza, which was greatly affected by the Palestinian fire.
He advised his children to study carefully and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite reconciliation last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement ended immediately, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the requirement for Hamas to remove the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to put up weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, including three-quarters of whom were civilians, were killed in the war and at least 494 children, according to the estimates of the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were warriors; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazans launched 4591 rockets and mines across Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials had postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is now living in one of Gaza's schools.
According to popular criteria, real estate prices have shown the highest winter growth in seven years.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a total increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The Director of Research RP Data Team Louless reported that Sydney and Melbourne are conducting a two-tier market.
The RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 per cent in the past year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The next power markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices grew from five to six per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which resulted in government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per annum.
Mr. Louless said that, now that spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items sold for several months, which would be a “present test” for the market.
“In view of the current high speed of auction sales, the overall high speed of sales and the current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to increase in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in Ufa’s Oldest House
In the former gold industry and mining house of Eudokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Greater Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed since it was built.
The local people go here as they go on a trip, and the residents suffer more than they are happy with their privilege of living in the oldest Uffim house, whose walls are remembered by Colonel Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it's got to be a building with no less than 300 years.
An old yard, always an open door, a sloppy staircase.
The doors in the apartment are located close to each other, the walls are torn apart, and the lights from the stupor are visible on the street.
Everyone seems to be holding on to an honest word.
And the local people say, "You don't think so."
Living in the woodhouse of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatian Lukyanov, resident of Apartment No. 3.
The facility is in custody, but the money for its contents is not spent for decades, and we feel like the museum exhibits the authorities just forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still safe, but the foundation is all gone.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and they go to the public bathroom once a week.
How can you be satisfied with such conditions?
The road runs straight under the windows, even without a pedestrian zone.
Tatyana's leaving the van.
Now it is evident that before that, there has been only a voice: there is a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is constantly dwindling, the windows can't be opened, but the noise is used.
But man is accustomed to all things, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, three with our son.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, and on the second floor, there's a half a metre taller.
To the contrast of Tatian, he suggested visiting a neighbor from Apartment No. 6 Man of the Old Age.
A pleasant host woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and smiles with a sad smile:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 per person, and we live with a husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another place, and the guy's eyeballing the room: antresols, two "g" sofas; one of them had a granddaughter with a laptop.
It's very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: it's only too beautiful, "historic".
But with a regular flow: the water supply system is not suitable anywhere.
Manmila talks about her apartment in a pleasant and surprising way, as an Italian woman whose home is situated in Roman ruins.
It is a very old and recent, everyday and legendary one:
Water supply was carried out some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former hearth.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, living on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, yes and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Centre, it is said that privatization is irrelevant.
Still, we only get a one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to move, but the promises did not go any further.
I'm not used to complaining and I'm not.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandparents, my mom with dad, my husband and my daughter with grandchildren.
Everything's been so long.
For example, healthy rats ran into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they're the heights!
They say the solution was mixed up on the eggs, so it's been holding for so long.
The house is basically built, thanks to Demidov!
I guess that's why he didn't kill anyone with a broken jaw or his own.
The building is still slowly dying in our eyes: boards and roofs are rotting, the fields have collapsed repeatedly, we are sinking with cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes to the ground as well as to the well.
They're saying, well, under our room, there's a secret laz and a walk to the White River, which has been specially made by once living old men here to be able to hide from the danger of what?
And they were pursued.
The old man tells them how some historian came to them, asks them to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a place in exchange for their one on the October prospectus.
The man of history refused:
Where are we last Thursday?
And here, there's a little hope that they'll give you a more spacious home.
Let's agree to trade, we won't win anything.
However, the Old Age family won nothing.
The man's biggest dream of moving them out and his daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter giving a separate room.
That is, two families had a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A nice, miniature girl, Olesa Karsakov, from flats No. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms, a total of 23 m2 called apartments, her large family lives.
Seven of us, two of us.
See for yourself what the conditions are.
It is torn down by pieces, like window frames, in the walls of the kitchen and in the rooms through the doors.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
By walking through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, you can be sure that most of all have luckyd Lavrentie's wives from Apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
The 75 square rooms are reserved for three people.
We live just once in the rooms where Suvorov was a legend when he was staying in Ufe, says the head of the Aleksandr Dmitrievic Lavrentieev family.
So high, spacious.
One bad thing is it's all about the tails, it's broken, it's broken.
Neighbors must have already told us!
Most of all, we've been suffering from the sexes: the wooden boards have collapsed, the earth has literally disappeared from under our feet.
I've put in the back, the clinkle; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we're going as we climb on the cats, so much as a bat.
The house of the Buyer of Eudokim Demidov, Alexander Dmitrievic, can tell the best of any tour guide.
The gold industry is regarded as a native, he speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the figure was inconvenient: the owner of the Caginian and Uzian factories built a house, took out guns and cologne, held ural mines.
The heirs of the purchase property are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievic.
At that time, there were wooden carriages, horses and caravans around, and then they were taken off.
In 1968, they wanted to take our house down, but something got in the way...
The story was repeated in 2014: a new home was lost.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran the necessary instances, and suddenly found out that the transfer to the apartment was moving to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housekeepers didn't accept.
They were sent from table to table, and then, as a laughingstock, they put out a paper without signature and print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to housing."
I even felt that our house was not in the city for a long time, because it was under number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he's been taken away in the '70s.
The Russian Planet addressed the leading sector of information and analysis on the land resources management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of October Revolution 57/1 is included in the housing programme.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan for the maintenance of all the old houses at the time, despite the historical importance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, but the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution of architectural value is being successfully implemented.
In the short term, residents are scheduled to move to new apartments.
According to Barabbas, the Demidov House will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
The house will acquire a suitable species, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The home of Demidov will probably be a museum open to all those who want to.
In addition, it was decided at the Government level to make a street on departure days.
Unfortunately, there will not be too much traffic in the city.
To move people out of the future Vladimir Barabash Museum promises in 2015.
However, they will not be satisfied; their new apartments will be the same as the current ones.
Only from the second century.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the threat
The drought was the cause of a forest fire in the territory of the hunting area in the Fire Region of the Primordial Region.
There is an increase in the pooling of forces and funds at the site of the fire.
According to information provided by CCSB, the Primordial Air Base, which is established at the site of the fire, requires the involvement of the air forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Aviation:
A fire that occurred in an inaccessible location has been detected by an observer on board an An-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
They're burning wood wastes on the old burner.
The strong coldness of the territory and the stiffness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire-fighting sites create significant difficulties in the process.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of air force by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the detection of the fire at the site of the fire, four fire-fighting parachutes were rapidly decomposed.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishers.
In the area of lunch, 3 firefighters have been delivered by helicopter to the village of Ochotnichi.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be transferred to the place of loading, the Primordial Administration site will be reported.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born into a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry repeats the comedy, "Red Rudy" which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio broadcasts.
Soundtrack is a mixture of tails and tails, and the songs are life-suffering.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother died, he had a lot of treatment, and Henry often thought about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, but you heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move!
I want to see the cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of the cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an insatiable guy in the corner that he read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently discovered a Lithuanian master's in Dadley and, although conditions were better than his father's, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
It's not much better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinths beneath with sparks of fire and smoke and dog tails.
My father went into the bathroom and was just lying there, and you heard how slowly he started singing about himself because he wanted to get rid of the lithium master.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it for years and years to earn us food, and I began to appreciate it more.
However, Henry came out of childhood with a lack of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the very end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he had never had in his childhood.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why don't I hang out with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still good friends with French, where he's been married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I hang out with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness exercises, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career path may have been reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he was recognized as a critic for his Otello, he has been fully involved in the theater.
She followed the Comedy Errors, and then the Battles of August Wilson.
This work differs from nettles and comets, which were an integral attribute of his saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Didjey noticed how he was born on stage and wrote about him in the New Faces.
His career on television began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time I was the only black parody on television."
He learned to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, but I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White Men's Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry discovered what he was talking about for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don't want it ever to be with me, but I don't regret what I did.
Although it was a strange, judgmental position, I worked in large squares and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was the “rewarded light entertainment class on British television for years and years” was also the “grotesque parody for black people”.
He represented the characters who were also embellished and successful in the black culture of Britain, and Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of show Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chief of the Garret Blacklock comedy series "Chef!".
The commercials, documentary films, television shows and film roles took over the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it doesn't seem like you're wasting your time or rest on the side."
There was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's Good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had this allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't tell me how much I've been taught in school, and I thought it was, in many cases, the privilege of the middle class with the dolls and the coat down front.
So I was really afraid of him.
All the people we interviewed were Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, who said, "You have to try.
Don't bother about it until you know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of those words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and it was sealed.
I feel like I can do this.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what this is, this is a serious matter, with regard to this serious, study your text, do a small study.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
It was said they were waiting for disasters, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
A technical failure occurred, and Henry instinctively felt that his work was to distract the audience.
"The silent voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're making a computer."
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the play."
Henry in "Zaborah" at the Dachess Theatre
It was hard to study the text for the "Courts".
Panic's good enough, it strengthens muscle.
They also took it well, so it was like a sign above, showing you, "That's what you have to do."
He said that, of course, by a loud voice.
So I'll stick to it.
I really love that.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the idea of a comedian -- all the way to our conversation, he's going through the cracks of his mood when he starts it, he's going to end up paranoia.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with getting instant pay from the whole room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do this, it could lead to stupidity.
Sometimes I work in the Straight Air in Apollo whenever I want, but mostly, I don't get that kind of pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever get to the stand again.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who helps to form the beginning, the middle and the end of the way - I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
Is that his new appearance?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a good time.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government ' s payment statement.
Officials who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the Government statement reports.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£7000000) per month was lost through payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to be on bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from Nairobi.
All public servants should appear within the next two weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through biometric registration procedures, as reported in the Government statement.
Any person who fails to do so without a good reason will be removed from the payment statement, as reported therein.
“This procedure is essential for streamlining the public service by identifying the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Waigur, Secretary of the Ministry of Planning and Structure of Power.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested for “agreement” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion of “agreement against the Government”, reports local information agencies.
Police representatives did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had been involved in corruption detection activities in last December, which was aimed at checking government officials, including four Government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for suspecting the establishment of an organized criminal group and the hearing of the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then the Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others by the authorities, Islamic clariqué Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
The schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after the summer canals.
This day is traditionally a major event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenien Yacenjuk took his daughter to school.
There he told reporters who expected that not all schools had been opened again, but that he would do all he could to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on the first September.
There is no peace sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
The entire Ukraine, a huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastuhov, the head of the school in Slavyanska, where the daughter of Yacenjuka went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
On the first day of school, children usually wear high - quality clothes, hold air scarves, and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an inspiring leader she needs
It is followed by a wave of fame from the world of banking, media management and the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Her career began in the consulting firm on Global Management of Bain and Co and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the world of the media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position in Pearson's headquarters was held by a lower-ranking male colleague.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall: she was a ministerial adviser.
Her husband's ex-advisor Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the president of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: within as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but outside as a voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopolis that requires full radical reform.
However, what a new president would risk coming, destabilizing and destroying the Institute as difficult as the Chinese dynasty if it failed to work in this process.
It's a tough solution.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see how the BBC will decrease in size, after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
While competitors are narrowing the circle and new technologies are causing bottlenecks of old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the value of the licence pose a special danger to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share of the world's largest media company.
BBC tells a good story: it states that its results cover 96 per cent of households and each of them has a total of 40p per day.
Moreover, it is evident that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use patterns of BBC have changed: now I receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and exciting institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone from a side
A tweet from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, the Republic of Rick Perry, contained an insulting picture of a district prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the centre of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
Twitter was removed later, followed by another Perry account, in which the record was devalued.
It's just that a tweet was published from my account, which was written by someone from the outside.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it off," says the note later.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the requests to comment.
Although the records were loaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was unclear who was actually involved in publishing the tape.
Earlier, the tweet contained an unfriendly cartoon for the district attorney Travis Rosmary Lemberg, who admitted that he was responsible for the drinking situation in April 2013.
Perry had imposed a ban on the financing of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who was a potential candidate for the 2016 elections.
Your signature says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry with what he tells me about it."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg report did not conduct an investigation involving a large jury against Perry.
They took care of Michael McCrumm, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not consider himself guilty and called the charges a political trap.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute a governor who had long been responsible for all of Texas ' s history would flow contrary to the Constitution.
Perry suspended funding of $7.5 million from the State's Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is involved in the prosecution of corruption in the public sector in Texas when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto filed an official complaint by a group of public controls with left-wing views.
Perry's confirmed account tape is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry arrived at the fifth party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to the news that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a picture of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London's most famous designers warned that the real estate market in South-East England had returned to normal activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of a revitalized demand and rising prices, and there were widespread fears that a credit bubble would subjugate the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Piggly, the founder and president of the Berkeley elite construction company, said on Monday: "From the beginning of the current financial year the market has returned to normal transaction level since the 2013 peak," adding that it has provided a "sustainable working environment".
The London real estate market succeeded during the fall, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent last year alone, according to the Land Register, significantly increased the average rate of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales in general.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes Berkeley grew by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 by the end of April.
However, strengthening the pound in recent months has made London's property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about the potential “tax on individuals” before the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, under which more stringent loan conditions were introduced, would also lead to a decline in market growth both in real estate sales and in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, assuming further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, on the basis that real estate price adjustment has already begun to weaken.
Transactions fell to a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for a home in the capital has proved very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales of more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijgley added: "The demand for goods with good design and better location has remained old and, reflecting this, sales have remained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost a third more than in the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
The annual income before payment of taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijgli reported that Berkeley's expected revenues this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, income is expected throughout the year before tax payments of £450 million.
Berkeley held a price of £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the second half of the day.
Photographs by Jennifer Lawrence discovered have been published on the Internet by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrived at the 85th ceremony of the annual American Film Academy Award.
The photos of the discovered actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet hacker, who assures that he has 100 more emerging stars in the photo catalogue.
The star representative of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence are present, condemning the hacker for “a sudden invasion into private space”.
The law enforcement authorities have been treated, and they will be persecuted by anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange were allegedly obtained due to the lack of an Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of the fracture includes dozens of names of women, including Ryanna, Kim Cardassian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are real, even though the star Scott Pilgrim against all of them, Winstead, on Twitter, also condemned the invasion.
"The one who looks at the photos we took with his husband a few years ago when he joined the house, I hope you're proud," wrote Winston on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nicklodeon series iCarly and Victoria winner denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are the so-called photos of the FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop this in the womb.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the Aryan Grande pop star rejected the fact that the photo on which it is supposed to be real.
An exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and "J" that brings praise to critics
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is, they gradually collapsed, like the cardboard box they left under the rain.
Only at times did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in society, tense, closed, and may be a bit annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw an irritation in himself.
He was squeezing like a goat, yeah.
The last victim of this bribe was a small novel he expected more than usual, deliverance from solitary and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a trimming beauty with damaged hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and severe than Port Ryben.
She came south with a satellite older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunts, and the latter received a legacy from a home in the raw, but similar to a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes of the leaks, the spiders sitting still in the baths, left their trails on all the windows that they believed belonged to them; the garden grew with thorns similar to giant catfish.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, simultaneously frightening and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Longlist of the Bucharest Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen sat, holding their hands, in broken locks in the middle of a high grass, enjoying an unexpected hot spring day; they both sprawled into the cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and comforting news, when, looking at her twisted brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long - forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, leaving the door shut.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their aggressiveness, such songs on the console were no longer lost.
They were not forbidden, nothing was forbidden, they simply did not lose them.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic."
The public taste did what would never have been possible by orders and regulations, and just as people had chosen the memoranda of rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels from all over the world, they had chosen ballads from all over the music.
As he entered that day, Kevin began to play in the imaginary piano and a rough comedy voice to make Eileen’s big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said to her, adding two fingers to his losses.
That's how his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she got off his lip.
It started with the games they played when he was a kid.
His father played with his father as he told him.
Start with "J" and forget to apply two fingers to the liver, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew he'd be expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he wasn't open.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only one place left to eat.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With the blade exactly the same.
His unpredictability affected people’s nerves.
And jazz was an ostracism expressed in music.
Although he was ten years old, he never heard of Sammy Davis Younger, Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But even though he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Considering her age, she could hardly remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude, thanks to those who had saved their fate, with the principle of group bias.
People of African-Caribbean background on temperament and physical characteristics have taken a good approach to entertainment and sports - and they sing and run.
Those from India, as if by nature they were talented in everything about electronics, assumed that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was a synthetic work; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
The exits of the Persian Gulf and Levant whose grandfathers did not begin to leave the country when TO, WHAT WAS PROTECTED, IF THE GENERAL PROTECTION arose, fear that they would be accused of burning the fire, in fear of saying that the fire would devour them the following, opened the restaurants with the labs and the boilers, were not excavated and choked by inactivity.
Every one of them.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, it was hard for Eileen to understand how hurtful words that she had just uttered to Kevern could be put on music at all.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're really not insulting," said Kevin.
Or what, maybe, for people who have big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the started garden gave him a security illusion.
No word could penetrate through the sound isolation of giant leaves similar to the shell.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to stick two fingers at her again.
She already thought it was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She raised her head in disbelief, closed the Kiev survey.
There was nothing in the world except the land of its black and white hair.
Nothing he wants to see.
"Well, if that's what you're saying," she said, staying in her mind.
But that doesn't explain why you eat it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Dolls, you might feel...
And you're saying you hate me because my dolls are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but that was too early.
"I like you just because you've got a lot of dolls," he tried to say instead.
I've got such a fuss.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Trying to kick him was often unpleasant because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring promise that could soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted it.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons adorned herself and rose up from the chazlonge, tearing down the console and pouring the wine that they drank.
Wine from the jar, so the drink could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in the hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive harshness of her words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him up.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that in the main hell she was like a right-wing.
The same huge ice-cream had hit both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF ANY PROGRAMME BETWEEN their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, were angry with the pope and prepared to raise their hands against any woman who laughed at them or taunted them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid doll if she hadn't been careful!
They would first kiss -- kiss now becomes the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; opposition from the press that issued the console -- first kiss her and then hit her.
More detail, according to Kevin, because kissing yourself was already a hooligan.
Eileen Solomon’s corpus showed that he needed to leave.
He got up from the locker room like an old man.
She felt a lead burden herself, but her grief struck her.
It wasn't the end of the light.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and out of the top window, she saw him leave, her companion, the man who carried the burdens himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and his men at all, even though some of them had raised her hand.
The man who had turned his back on her, with his back bent, contrived, with all his might to fight left him-- why did she think she knew it so well if she could not remember any case until today when she saw it?
Once again, an Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or around the Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Offnau, an informal community control service, prepared a small report on the maintenance of low and medium levels of violence in the same parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced if it did not stop altogether, taking into account the resources and forces that had been allocated for its eradication.
"Many have been done, and many are being done," she wrote, "in order to soften the hostility of the people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these scattered waves and the narrow plains of the locality, where, in spite of the hangings of the churches, the gentle breathing of human kindness was rarely felt throughout history.
However, some of the qualities appear unresolved.
The higher the cave, the lower the passions he has.
The population sheds tears over sentimental bowls, swallows up the history of obstacles and proclaims its belief in a virtuous marriage and family life, but not only old harshness keeps its grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence of new and malicious cruelty in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have a boring habit of writing too much," said her research director, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I ask," said Luther Rabinovic, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and self-respecting, can sometimes cause results, such as what you have shown me.
Obviously, you are preconceived against the church itself, and what you call "wrath" and "graves" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to ask what had happened, if there had been a general proposal, as if it had happened, yesterday, that would mean that it was not a country that needed life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic was speaking.
Behind his head roses, such as flamingo, the light diocese repeated the advice that "ofnau" gave to the country for the last fourth century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, your wife's prices, listen to the ballads, go to the music, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A word of silence is better, a word of song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she found out that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been treated as effectively as we are convinced of ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that initially led to TOM, which turned out to be if it didn't work.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinovic joined the ends of his fingers in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling "errors" actions that did or did not do our grandfathers.
You go too far and when you say they've thrown their anger and mistrust into others.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, in the past, that is to say, protecting the present, we are not talking about “we” and “them”.
There were no "we" and there were no "other".
It's been a rough time, that's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can rightly justify itself.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree here.
And how no one should be blamed, no one should be excused if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why was the past, if not for learning?
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovica has fallen apart.
"I'll look into your account," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who walked out on the sidewalk, as described as walking, "in anger."
That's what happens.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup is not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho Army rejected the preparation of a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they were acting against the police, whom they suspected in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Prime Minister brought his family into neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received a threat to his life.
Major Ntléle Ntoi's army representative said that there was in fact no revolution, but that the army had responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that really plan to arm some political, young political fanatics who were prepared to build chaos,” he told the American Voice.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Moniel, said that the army ' s actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has submitted a claim to take power, according to all the information, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces now have major signs of coupration," he said.
Representatives of the Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital had calmed down.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing is running by the Government in the absence of Tabana.
The Taliban stated that it believed that it was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho was very tense since June, when tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in its joint Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the charges in return.
Colporteur Chelsea Marco van Ginkel will hold the upcoming lease season in Milan, says Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will be in Italy in the near future to conduct a medical examination.
In the last season, he only went out in the field of the London Club three times.
Remember, Milan used to rent a Liverpool attacker named Fernando Torres.
Manufacture in euro area at the lowest rate in 13 months
The growth in euro area production slowed to the lowest rate in 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The latest value of the business activity index (MIP) for the euro area production sector in Markit fell by 50.7 in August, with a drop of 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 points to growth.
New orders have been detained and companies have been affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The European Central Bank (ECB) meeting took place on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the cessation of the recovery of the euro area and the threat of inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that the head of the ECB, Mario Dragi, may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative reduction scheme for the euro area, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than any growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
Germany’s production sector PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of score 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest block economy in France, the PMI dropped to 46.9.
France continues to be concerned about this as well as Italy ' s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the impulse to increase emissions in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, does not add confidence either," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to be even more difficult for analysts waiting to introduce additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of the IHS Global Insight, said: "The more we can say about the August study of the business activity index of the euro area industry, the more it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The euro area producers are obviously living very difficult at the moment, as the current growing geopolitical tension - especially in connection with Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to the difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business - and especially consumer confidence - and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some variety of quantitative mitigation, "though we suspect that it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupola will present a live chain against the settlers
In Mariupol last week, everything was peaceful — no one wanted to organize the Mariupolan People’s Republic, the city of the Azov Sea, and work.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of "policemen".
According to politicians, separatists are breaking up to Mariupoli to go to the Azov Sea - recently taken to the city of Novoazovsk, which had not previously been part of the self - proclaimed republics.
Mariupoli decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, had little force against the excellent armed representatives of the DND-LNR, and had gathered to assist the military.
They're tearing holes, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a lifeline, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same thing in the event of an incident.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, publish paper.
In the city, shops are closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten Years of Hell for the Survivors Beslan: Ten Years of Enormous Enormity at School Like the Children In It
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at the Beslan school in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day test, which shook the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death at the zoo.
Just ten years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children who had suffered a heroic disaster, were warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed to be something of the extreme degree of evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West together in a reversal, which was surprisingly then brought to action and hope for the future in the face of the worst of woes.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, south of Russia, to find some of the victims who cheated on death at school.
We have found amazing young people who have endured disaster, even though memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now taking place in Ukraine, in which children like them are killed, will now cease.
A girl trying to take her picture back to the shooting gym
It was printed in a photo by a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitria Belakova, when she tried to take it back to the shooting sports hall after the mine exploded.
In the destruction of Aida, she desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There was a fear that they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run away from all the forces, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldiers improved her and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Thirty months ago, the pain has returned.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
A few shots remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but of course she didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remind everyone who's left.
My friends and I don't try to talk about it the other day.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my roommate, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the grip remains on her, even though her memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see an Internet photo, where I go into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and do it so that it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through the city pool, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at 7 years of age) and he survived three days of arrest, including his mother Tamara.
Then he had seven, and he said, 'My mother said to me, "If there is an explosion, then let me take it in her hand."'
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying little boy on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran through the city pool.
His father Vladimir, who captured his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara chose to go free and was in a hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
She said after they had joined her: "I cried out with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now the non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protection Officer for the Bernardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Shery.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that I have a memory of him.
I remember dropping all my toys right after that.
But now I can play computer games with a gun, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard who didn't.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the playground, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted, and the trip to the car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have survived.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was doing volunteer work last week at the women's monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police sometime, and I hope to be enrolled at the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the yellow silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children to scream and run around, and that silence continued for many months.
She will remember her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
I understood that people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings and support us.
She thanked Shery Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her for 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the brothel, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the officers at the restaurant, Damir shot them out of his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And the whole month went by after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world hasn't been better in 10 years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and will be killed.
They're just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy.
I just know how these people feel about this.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not at all aggressive and not evil.
He's not looking for a place, for example, he's not surrounded by this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall every once in a while and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember him lying on a couch turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep. His eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I will never see him again.
When I was able to repair the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked around and saw parts of the body lying all over me.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run away," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
This life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgia Illin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture has become the determining factor for the tragedy in Beslane
Peace: surviving Beslan Georgie Illin and his mother Fatima after the arrest in 2004, and the Georgia case today
On his injured face was the impression of fear when he was saved from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, was taken to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
"I left in two minutes before the terrorists fled to the yard, so my little boy stayed one for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not only was there a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
In the heart: the photograph Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was forever preserved in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie wanted to go to school the day she said she wanted to take a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
Now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in a book cabinet in our house.
I understand, but I also think that this photograph makes people all over the world feel our pain.
Georgia now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boing's riot in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what she was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, they don't want war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to forget her a little.
She influenced my health, and I still feel it.
I've had nightmares about three or four years since I got caught, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very afraid every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That is why I continue to go to this sports hall before every 1 September.
I want to remind my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel victimized, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated this year from school and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'll learn to be a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to go into the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I didn't let my health go.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the foot of a terrorist killer
Incredible: Georgi Farniev was at the foot of the terrorist-killer during the capture, but he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports room next to a bomb at the killer's feet.
Really, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We think it was just yesterday,” says Georgie, who wanted to study with an intelligence officer at the FSB, but he couldn’t because of the damage he had caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they're saying kids are easy to deal with bad things, I have to say, it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting on this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with a photo opened on a laptop in the hospital after the arrest
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical status is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking okay.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical findings, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second involvement was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I've been studying there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals from "cow to cows."
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about my experiences.
This is not what children should know, and of course it is not what they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him it must be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so awfully unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take care of his knees.
He had a few operations, he could walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he'd overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget.
This bitter experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only exacerbates my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart is hurt for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to believe that life is going on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart broke out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them out as far as you can.
Alona Ccaeva, 10 years old
A young man who is moved to a safe place by a specialist
Saved: Alyona Zkaev is a Russian specialist (left) fighter.
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember the monster crime.
In the world, breathing was stopped in 2004, when a Russian police officer took a small Alion out of the seized school in Beslane.
The terrorists let her go, but they cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's ten-year-old sister and Brother Mahara in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Aloni’s mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has been married since then, and they have his new wife, Svetlana, a little daughter he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, who is now ten, has no memory of the capture and flowering in a smart and lively girl, says neighbors.
"They are the great happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children," said a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Colonel Cindy Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, noted that he was anxious to be able to go out in the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy event in your career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will play "Borusia" again - the image of the word Kagawa.
I feel really good.
It's a trap of positive emotions and I look forward to seeing how I can get out of the field again in the form of "Borusia".
Remember, Kagawa moved to the IMI from Borussia in the summer of 2012 to 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to join the English club, with a total of 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, killing 6 balls and delivering 8 performances.
A man accused of finding a girl on a pedestrian crossing “pelican” in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be brought before a court for the charge of a three-year-old girl walking “pelican” to Fife.
Gordon Stuart was supposed to have killed a girl on the way to Pittenvin in East Newke.
The prosecutors said that Mr. Stuart had brought his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and had killed the girl, which resulted in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from the Attorney, denied his guilt at the Dandhi Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a king's lawyer, has appointed a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland don't play in the government.
The duty-free shop at the Royal East Airport has set up a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders in the store.
Don't give them the spirit, the water, and the horse.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, FRG Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Holland, Vitaly Clicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other known associates could not relax by water, horses and spirits in their store.
And put a corresponding tablet on the door.
Earlier, Obama had been banned from appearing in an even less accessible form of the Dietary Table IGU facility, as reported by the Department of Public Health.
Whether the American President ever had a dream of eating at a diet table in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the ban appear to be awfully cruel.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that Russian agrarians should develop new technologies in the context of the embargo in order to establish the issue of demand for raw materials.
The Board was given a visit to the company Yupticeprom by Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the restaurants to reorient themselves to Russian meat whose quality is at an appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced into Russia from 7 August.
The main coach of the Russian Constituent Valentin Masalakow is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted competition training.
Our athletes have spoken at their level, the word "All Sports" says Masalaków.
Third, the confirmation of our sufficiently high level of command.
It is good that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we have not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to participation in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have been the second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed our meeting attendance.
The French, on the other hand, have issued a powerful team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly announced.
But even such a group of competition leaders could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have spoken at a good level in such a representative company.
But some of the results were in order below the same Brilliant League.
The season's over.
Of course, sportsmen are no longer so important, the more they compete at the level of the team.
The main place was the place.
And as a result, it seems absurd, when men were so attracted by tactical holocausts that they showed the result below the average level... of women's races.
4 tips on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or take a video under the water, you have a variety of hardware options.
The cheapest option is a water-tight washroom, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or ex-camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these photos at the family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules are needed to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery camera and other offices are fully closed.
In addition, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras have sampling modes or object types that optimize exposure to dark underwater conditions.
And before you sink into the water, you'll find out how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
See our Buyer's Guide and Digital Camera Ratings for both traditional and water-borne models.
Take a few shots, because most of them don't get.
There's a D.C.D. that'll help you compose the photos, when the ex-camera doesn't usually have them.
Even if you have a CCD, it will be difficult to deal with under water, and staffing will be a random process.
So do a few things.
Also, if your camera has a serial recording system that takes several personnel with a little different exhibition facilities, take advantage of them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly more deeply than you dive under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you take off in the pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less the color you see.
Swim closer to the sampling facilities.
It's a great advice for land grabbing, but it's even more important under the water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important if you're shooting on a camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get closer to the sampling facilities if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Prize of the Olympic Games for the Free Fight of Bilal Mahov can go to the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the Chief Coach of the Daguestan Congregation for the Free Fight of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of sportsmen at the Tashkent Peace Championship in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the "classic" team," says Sajid Sajidov, “R-Sport.
In fact, as a youth, Bill spoke both ways.
At the 2005 youth world championship, he became the winner of the tournament of volunteers and the third prize in the Greek-Rome competitions and decided to focus on free fighting.
There have been long discussions that a new phase of our career will take place in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can be on the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the championship.
But the decisive word always behind the coach headquarters in the head of Gogi Koguasville.
Andrew Lawson was such a person whose strength was able to stand all around, even in a giant organization such as the National Health Service.
The consultant anesthesiologist dedicated his career to the relief of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, his wife was a MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Louson realized that while the doctor was involved in diagnosis and disease, those who were being treated were mainly concerned about something else -- pain.
Once in 2007, however, he became the first to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he found that he was upset with his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he noted.
When Juliet left for a week's work, Lauson found out that he was unusually upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he had been on skis in the French Alps.
X-ray results came.
It was a mesothelioma, irreparable cancer that affected the plevior, or a cloud of light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers suffer from mild cancer, for example, not all suffer from mild smokers.
But with mesothelioma another.
In almost every case, the reason is the contact with asbestos, the fibre building material that was once called "a miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, in the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: plumbers, builders, sailors and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another era, is it hardly a cause for concern today?
But such calmness is wrong.
Britain seems to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
In the case of an annual death rate of some 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and forecast number of future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now feel its fatal consequences is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesotheliomas usually takes decades.
And mesotheliomas are not restricted to the vets of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, housed where we live, offices where we work, schools where we study, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not focus on the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of election, from modern London universities to private schools, seemed to be no salvation.
Parliament's building is paved with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have proved to be reservoirs of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber.
In fact, he had to think where he could get in touch with the asbestos.
Then he agreed.
"It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Gai hospital, where I spent six years in the internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and truckers used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers get sick of the same disease?
It was a question for which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been interned in the Gai hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I was left alive alone."
How many of us are sick of this disease?
Andrew Lowson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's been so unusual for so long.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lauson, "How many of us are sick of the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they'll die like this.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen had been unattended about asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing departments on two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I hardly knew about asbestos.
I couldn't get in my head that it would touch me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibre structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysothyl, widely known as white asbestos, is much more frequent in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, plate plated plates, thermal insulation tubes, pulleys, even in car brakes.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless recognized by the Euro Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, although indirect reasons to believe that this is the main cause of an extremely high number of patients with mesothelioma [in Britain]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pitto's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study that suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known effect on work or home, are likely to be caused by environmental asbestos”.
Most of this effect, he says, is due to “normal use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report by Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the government ' s very center, could have been affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could move as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be quite the opposite.
Although the Department of Technical Services of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitary certificate”, it now recognized that work needed to be done for the reconstruction of Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might be sitting in the QE2 conference centre near the corner rather than in the green corners of the Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not governed by different rules”.
It is not possible to know if this mismanagement will cost you your life.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who failed to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of common practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Ebbott, 50 years of age, suspected that he had been affected by asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, so it was the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the surgery late at night.
All of a sudden, I got sick.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pelvis, a cloud around the light.
However, like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect a mercenary.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for months.
The tasked doctors took X-rays of the breast cell and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained undiagnosed.
He gradually improved his health and returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he had been in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, an Ebbota patient came to him with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link it to his own case.
At the end of the day, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consulting physician showed the results of the CT and X-rays to the group of experts.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a sensor equipped with a camera was introduced into the middle between his chest and his easy chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came on a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Grem Ebbot: mesothelioma diagnosed
Ebbott suddenly came to a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes has been quite common," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people than typical professions.
The most dangerous isolated asbestos tubes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff who walked through the tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or eat in the basements (as Grem Ebbot often did) are almost likely to be actually affected by the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, hospitals seemed to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that was a threat to the lives of doctors who had treated them.
He's still missing today.
Schoolers set up their Bunzen burners on asbestos bases
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and Marys because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many were likely the first to be exposed to the influence of asbestos in the classroom.
Throughout the country, at countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos bases.
Websites focused on the problem of asbestos in schools have emerged.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as tiles or roofs of the Saras usually contained asbestos.
"This is the industrial poison that is put into the huge amount of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lauson in the case against the Gay Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the fall of the garden sara in the 1970s.
So be careful, you'll have garden rats.
The effect of diagnosis when it is known that the disease is incurable is huge.
"To realize this, it's been quite a while," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I went to surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I was going to have to go and talk to myself.
Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers how much information had to be taken.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
He gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanics of how we support life -- just the act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the plevior, a cloud of light.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is due to the breath of molten asbestos fibers,” Professor Tom Treger, a heart surgeon who came to the hospital in 2001.
That is the hospital, where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he had been affected by asbestos, now by the ironic fate of the mesothelioma treatment center.
The security guard knew Lauson and treated some others who were likely affected by incarceration.
When the asbestos needles fall into the fabric of the light, says Treger, "by breathing them out onto the periphery where there's a cloud.
It's, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
Common alternatives to other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is caused by heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the pleural," he says.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer "is not well treated with chemotherapy", which "is working", but does not cure.
"There have been sick people who have been living for a long time," says Treger.
But in the end, they're all dying.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Steven Jay Gold died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis was established, Grem Abbott continued to fight.
After he became a mesothelioma, Ebbota was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis was diagnosed, became a single office of support and consultation for the same patients.
"Hello, the Central Cancer," he said excitedly when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and prolong his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Louson, however, "tried to give everything a little more positive decoration."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazduński, professor of thoracic surgery at the Gay hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," says Graham.
The average statistical patient would have to receive a direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is inevitably ineffective, many sufferers face another financial cause for concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was what it became clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
That's when they talked about the company's mistrust.
Andrew Lawson and Gaya's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-value solution," Morgan said, as Lauson was unable to clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbestos in Gaya's hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaius Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements that were mentioned was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lauson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking the death to asbestos with one company or place of work, usually decades later, was a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers either changed the owner or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from the demands know that there is no time for the plaintiffs.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that facilitates the mesothelimic recovery of compensation, even if it is not possible to track their former employers.
Under this law, a fund of £350 million was created, financed by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact with anyone but no one to be tried.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally award for compensation, approximately £120000.
About 300 successful claims on this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is “very good work” for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurers," he said, pointing out that the sum is a fourth amount that insurers would have to pay if there was no temporary intervention and the patients with mesothelioma could track the company and claim the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "uncompleted".
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said during Bill's second reading of the mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Grem Ebbot had been in the hands of Professor Loick Lange-Lazduński for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he considered to be effective, unlike Tom Treger.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski could take advantage of 40 per cent of the survivors over five years.
Ebbott felt an influx of power.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Grem Ebbott is in operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans did not show any evidence of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was a couple of fifths in my chest.
I just had to make 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of a leak.
However, the process was both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- the finances when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a timer works on a boater.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant that I would not live until I was old.
They responded very differently.
Temzin is very common and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all sick cancer has to face.
But for those with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by a vague possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it a dark definition (although, ultimately, for Steven Jay Guld).
According to Andrew Morgan, "the mussel is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed Pharaohs are returned to the asbestos fabric.

During World War II, a shipyard was developing intensively, one of the most deadly asbestos-related professions.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal reaffirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in the United Kingdom.
The world production of asbestos increases by more than 4213000 tonnes per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the United Kingdom.
The compensation scheme of £350 million is announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is about 2 million tons a year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters swear to revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to vote for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to lead to long-awaited protests in Hong Kong ' s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within the hours that followed this statement.
The decision of the All-China Assembly of People ' s Representatives, in fact, allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it does provoke anger," said the Democratic Party's president, legislator Emily Lau.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They fooled the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Lee Fay, Under-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of Peoples' Representatives, said that allowing the international election of the leader of Hong Kong would be too “haotic”.
Since 1997, when Britain had transferred control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the people of the region to vote in favour of the Government as from 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision adopted on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the racers the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also made clear that the Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the Beijing-controlled nomination commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was made after the summer when one of the largest and most widespread protests in Hong Kong over many years occurred.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to cover Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this universal electoral right.
On Friday evening, just hours after the statement, hundreds of the Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
In the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise to protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose details, obviously in an attempt to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of taking the central area only as an exceptional measure, which could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We are very disappointed that, to this day, all possibilities for dialogue will be exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong prepared to make a statement to Beijing for a few days, and on Sunday, security measures were stepped up with police and barricades.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The inflow of the mother population increases competition in the field of goods and services.
The fear is also growing that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are at risk of business - a source of life force in Hong Kong.
“The opposite they are talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long they will last,” said Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be concerned that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
Chinese State media have also reported in the last days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by the dissidents sent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
U.S. ball culture comes to university life: first-rate students were invited to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a request by launching the first luxury travel service in the UK for current students.
In order to leave a clear impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options such as a passenger plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also said that the service had thought about security.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country to a dangerous overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to reach the university with the minimum of effort and the maximum amount of light.
The representative of the company reported that, since this service had just been launched, the orders had not yet been made, but added that “the students would start ordering this service in the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9,000 a year, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and the VIF is what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Students ' Union has criticised this service as being de facto.
Megan Dann, Vice-President of the NSC for Higher Education, said: "The project seems to be incredibly out of the way of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month face the cost of living crisis when the available financial support in the form of loans and grants does not meet the growing cost of basic needs before they can start thinking at all about spending thousands of pounds on some kind of simple way of living.
Feminists raise the issue of raciality and police conduct after Ferguson
The unarmed adolescent was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The arrivals raise their hands, skating, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in front of the funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noted a move in the Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists, who left their comments, had placed genders above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West increased and national attention was drawn, Perez saw the responses of white women, which focused 100 per cent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as "the thoughts about Ferguson from the face of white women" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Pérez, they've shown a significant move.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to raciality, they felt that it was necessary to point out it.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio, Corita Mitchell Ferguson discovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “women’s problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get 150 likes out there," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why are women safe to talk publicly about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face difficult realities every day.
While white women are now uniting racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hetter, professor of female and gender research at George Mason University, says their predecessors have done the opposite.
“ Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and this has almost always been the reason for the rape of a white woman,” Hetter said.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story to justify lynching.
In Hetter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for election rights would be effective only for one group: women or black people.
"They decided to put all eggs in the basket of women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black people should have appeared later," Hetter said.
Looking back at such things gives us a clear picture of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had attained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to join against lynchings in the Association of South Women for the prevention of lynchings.
The group appeared almost 40 years after the black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell's view, the response of white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "run" the problems that black women had faced in several generations.
“ True, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception,” Mitchell asked.
The second wave feminists, who have made careers to fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white feminist activist, Gloria Stein two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a harsh article by the columnist Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans participate more in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger posed by the body - and the perspective of racial problems that differ significantly in public surveys - will be in the head of change," Steine wrote.
Although Stein is dealing with a more cross-cutting feminism, which includes racial issues and gender issues, her comments on race in America have so far surprised some.
A researcher at the American Institute of Entrepreneurry Christina Sommers, author of "Who stole the feminism?" said She The People that young men in the United States, especially the colorful young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments by Stein on Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch out for my brother," to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, it followed the angry reaction of many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the leading line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without accompanying them at the south-west border this year, immigration reform again came to the surface, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair of We Belong Together, a women ' s organization in support of immigration reform, said that in order to raise this issue as important to women, it was only necessary to share the stories of women immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who arrive with them are given a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich House with Pigs for sale
The photo of the house on sale in Safolke was taken by real estate agents when it was shown that it had a large pig that was resting in the hotel.
For sale for £120000, a separate house with one bedroom is located on a private road in Ipswick.
The detailed description was distinguished by a picture of the guest house, on which a pig with a head resting on the couch was depicted.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo was a home lover of the owner of the home.
"On the other hand, the photograph was incorrectly located and already removed," said the company's representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house as “a unique single house with one bedroom”.
Although the Agency has removed the photo from its website, it remains in advertising material.
The sale of a house has attracted interest in social networks where some have asked if the pig is sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to sportsmen, she wanted to finish the year and try to get to a new level, she moved from New York to Vasili OSIPOV.
How do you generally evaluate your results at the Biggest Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I was able to win the Rollan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I did not have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
She couldn't even get to the quarterfinal.
What challenges do you face by the end of the season?
After my stroke, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year.
The Asian series of tournaments is beginning in a few weeks.
A member of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sport and Youth, former peace champion Nikolai Valuev, proposed that GTO be awarded bonuses in the event of a wedding.
He said that, in general, regulations would be the same as in Soviet times, that people would submit rules on withdrawal, escape and other exercises.
It is recalled that 12 Russian actors will begin to implement the GTO rules as from 1 September in their territory.
I also invited schoolchildren who offered GTOs to give bonuses when entering the knots - Valuev noted.
For example, they can add some balls to the EEE.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers of enterprises that have passed the sporting tests.
A new millionaire appeared in the town of Harvey in South Wales after winning the lottery
Lottery game from Harvey this month.
Looking for a new millionaire in the southwest of Pert, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery crash on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvi brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, last win amounted to $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement about himself.
The owner of Steve Forward's bench said you won a win in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everything's very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the games from Kenning Well became one of the five million August, after a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and has reported that the win has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Minieconom development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, Minieconom Development will introduce an integrated environmental transport development plan to the Government in Russia, told the director of the department of Oleg Plujnik on the round table, which was held by the "Knowledge" at the Moscow Auto salon - 2014.
The plan is made by the Government, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - at the beginning of October - says the Plugniks that the proposed measures concern electric cars and hybrids - there is already a plan for the development of gas-fuel vehicles in Russia.
The plan (copy is available at the "Reports") is intended for 2014-2017.
The evaluation criteria for electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and decided on how to promote the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report to the Government, which will describe tax and customs support measures for electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the preferential lending and leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machinery, stimulate localization and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, changes are expected to be made to regulatory acts to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parks, parking stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make a proposal to the regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of clean transport - in the form of benefits for traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to increase the purchases of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Mineconomy will list indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The electricity market in Russia has not yet been established - about 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, the import levy on electric cars was cancelled, so sales would amount to about 500 items, says Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.
However, the five-fold growth does not make the electric cars quite noticeable: 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia, according to the European Business Association, in 2013.
While in Russia, electric cars are only imported by Mitsubishi Motors.
Renault is preparing for import - the company is focusing primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most of the other electric transport producers, however, took an outstanding position with regard to Russia.
There is also the development of electric cars by Russian producers - ", GAZa, " , but it is a poor issue.
For example, in January-July 2014, 30 electric cars were released according to ASM-Holdinga, AutoWAZ.
The low demand for electric cars, the director of AutoWAZa, for the engineering of Sergei Amanov, will not be able to hold a break in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market in addition to road vehicles (the electric cars sold in Russia, in the average two-way analogues with internal combustion engines) hinders the development of the charging infrastructure (units), inspired by the Director General Sergey Celikov.
Because of road traffic and low speeds in the next 3-4 years, electric vehicles will remain a viable segment of the Russian market, Michael Porajanski, the editor-in-chief of "Authorevu" predicts.
On the contrary, car manufacturers say that some models of electric cars are already close to normal values.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, mainly to reassure consumers that “electromobility” is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, says the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being carried out, for example, by the Rossetti gospoon: there are several stations built in Moscow and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of the container network are also being conducted with other regions.
According to the director of the department of Rossetej, Vladimir Sofia, the company believes in the market of electric cars and is ready to build appliances throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging different electric cars.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, is developing an opportunity to do so with regard to the charging of electric cars.
Pankov considered the most effective measure of support for the establishment of an electric mobile market in Russia to abolish customs duties.
The zero rate will operate until the end of 2014, it will be possible to extend, expand the list.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but it is not as sensitive as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric cars, which now accounts for 12 per cent of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is assured, or the possibility of moving electric cars on designated fields, which Russia has not yet.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46 single-engined aircraft crashed in Colorado, U.S.A.
Three of the five people who were killed were transferred to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place a few kilometres from Denver City Airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk area, the Donbass battalion is understood as a prisoner.
Carats were surrounded by Addis Ababa.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of rapists were killed under the gun.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation really was in southeastern Ukraine, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called happy.
The Donbass battalions remained alive after the "massor" they got under the Addis Ababan.
In the area of the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the soldiers spent several days, actually thrown away by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the ring could be pulled out of the corridor, the column moved.
But a few minutes later, guns and bullets came down from all sides.
"The judge, according to the information given to me, we had the corridor, we were allowed to leave, and the deputy battalion commander, who has the Lermont.
And when we went down between Multipolar and Rednostel, a cross-fire started with anti-tank-controlled rockets, with "shocks", 30-millimeter grenades, BMD automatic rifles, small weapons.
I got four cars ahead of me and behind three, and then there's only two left.
An officer called Lermont said that at least 60 people were killed, tens were injured, many died after that.
Surviving warriors are now providing medical assistance to those whom they have come to kill.
Prisoners are now surprised that so-called "terrorists" are treating them well, feeding them, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and claimed true death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
Column, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, as did many of his associates, Alexei acted as a volunteer, for in Ukrainian news, they told about the beast they claimed to have done in the south-east separatists.
Alexei has already seen a completely different picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
My friend called me, told me that a mini-missile was going to happen, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
Then I wanted to get out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Addiske, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written a report on the departure.
We were immediately taken to Addissk with Zurakhova.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 were killed in the Castle under the Addis Ababa.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be returned, they would not enter the penal battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the D.N.R. force.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.

That's what he told you in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government on compensation," said Secin.
According to him, the entry into operation of the modernized company Lisianska NPZ was planned in 2014.

The rubble falls on the background of geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar grew to 3 COP to 37.15 rubles, and the rubble dropped to a bi-curse in the background of geopolitical tension.
Exchanges at the US$ 37.11-37.2 rubs/$1, on average, in two minutes, the exchange rate was 37.16 rubs/$1, which was 4 copies above the previous closing level.

The U.S. dollar is traded for 23 copies above the official rate, the euro for 16 copies above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline on Friday, 29 August, but no panic occurred this time.
He continued to cheap and rubble and even updated the historical maxim to the dollar.
Now investors are already losing the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, as far as this is concerned, it is more like an artificial estuary that is leaked through the media, especially the West.
The options for introducing new sanctions to the RF are not so much.
TeleTrade " At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the rubble continues to be severely weakened against the bilateral basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Air Force" will be judged by "Ideal Tour"
The Orenburg Air Force filed an "Ideal Tour" claim for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
The two cases will be held in October.
There will be different judges to consider the case.

Victor Zukin, director of the airline, is talking about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Vitaly Savelev, director of the Aeroflot, is calling it a bigger sum -- two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have left their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be watching a large number of recommended accounts during registration to form their read-only circle immediately.
The recommendations are based on the registered interests.
However, Twitter automatically sets a subscription cap for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the hooks so that he does not read those who are not interested.
If users of microblogs have seen only the avatars of the recommended users before, Twitter now extracts a sample of one of the popular tweets of bloggers to help make an impression on people.
This is the biggest change in Twitter country registration in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to continuing efforts by the service to achieve immortality.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the user base and a decrease in reader activity.
The company is currently desperately in need of more loyal consumer resources, which, once again, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a Day of Drought and Rain
The first of September in the Moscow region would be cold and rainy all day long, meteorologists reported.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, in Sub-Moscow from 13 to 18 degrees.
When the weather is cloudy, there will be rain, and the east quarter wind will be quite weak, just 3-8 meters per second.
The vehicle-utilization programme has resumed since 1 September
As of 1 September, Russia has resumed its vehicle use programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the head of Minpromtorga RF Denis Mantourov, money is set aside from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade by redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme covers all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 for the light-duty vehicle to 350 thousand rubles for the cargo.
In Russia, a similar vehicle-utilization programme had already been in place.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now expected not only to use machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also that if a car is over six years old, it will be possible to acquire a new one with a discount when it is given to the dealer in the old trade-in.
More than 16 billion rubles have been lost to the previous federal utility programme, which runs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the level of light car production in 2010 was around 1.2 million (compared to 101.4% compared to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will play a modern journalism game
Game designer Nikki Case, a famous Come Out Simulator, decided to play a modern journalism game.
He told me about his project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact is that it's only now.
A source of inspiration for the game has become the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black youth.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be on how the information of history affects its impact.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will need to take a picture of what is happening in areas where police and population clashes are taking place.
A hero can take a different picture of what is happening, which affects the course of events.
If he shoots a scene that the police will look like heroes and the protesting gangs, the police will begin to treat him better and leave him where the ordinary can't go.
If he does otherwise, his photographs may turn peaceful protests into widespread rebellion.
The eyes of the game will need to be picked up by a hero Twitter, where new subscribers will appear if the photos displayed there become popular.
The game has not been named yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
However, Case published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially he wanted to dedicate it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than to protests in the United States.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he did not have enough knowledge and skills to clarify the history of the region.
However, when he saw the news of the events in Ferguson, he decided to play a game on the grounds of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
Its most famous project was Come Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events from the biography of Case itself, focuses on how bisexual adolescents try to tell their homosexual parents about their relationship.
Helicopter Draws Ukraine to Continue Blood Transfusion
The call to prepare for the next “ten thousand” victims of Ukraine’s defence minister, Valerie Geletei, is attracting the people to continue their bloody resistance, says the MID RF.
"In Moscow, of course, attention has been drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department Valeria Geleta, which said that the "end of the operation to rid Ukraine of terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great National War", which will include "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of Ukraine's military office, published on his Facebook page, as an object of study by non-military professionals," said Russian diplomats.
They find it hard to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “On informal channels the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us”.
He said that the “exemption operation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.

Tony Stuart has an accident back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended a little bit more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart cut into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke down at 172 rounds, ending his speech.

We'll go to Richmond, and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first hacked into the wall earlier in the race on the resurrection night after meeting Kyle Bush, which required repair on his right-hand side of the car.
"I started today with a pretty high hope of a successful finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded into the evacuation, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the ground track race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of a tragic incident, resulting in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Young, who was on the track to express Stuart's dissatisfaction during the race.

Sobac and Vitorgan are eating cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa
Xenia Sobčak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV conductor has not been able to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprised and very upset with the couple’s worshipers.
Photo taken in Zwanecko.
"On the morning of Michael Mikhalyc Zwanecko Maxim explains what such instagrams are:)) #Odess," she signed a photograph of Ksenia Sobčak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no bowl, no butter, no...
The couple decided that Xusha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?," "Fucking kills!"," "Sometimes a cigarette breakfast," "I'd like to have breakfast and only a table of cigarettes)")," "Suns, you smoke too?"--were excited about her blog's subscribers.
Remember, Sobčak recently boasted of the delicious meal that Max Wittorgan had made for her for the first time in her life.
"Happy it is when you come to the diner, and your husband has prepared a meal (the first time for his wife's life), for what a delicious one.The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he didn't say with the words from the anecdotes, "as if it were now every day," was pleased with his husband, Ksenia Sobčak.
The picture shows that Max is making something with his heart, and there's already a salt and a roasted chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the former working conditions that had recently been changed.
Increased salaries are also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice Christ Ivanov.
During the month, the officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials had met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice repeatedly, the agreement had not been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Chief Executive of the Office for the Enforcement of the Penalties of Rosen Jelezkov reported to the BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to join in protest against the union of prison officials.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed the Minister of Defence of the Right of Wongsuwan (left)
The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced a new Cabinet of Ministers of the country in which more than three posts are held by generals or generals in retirement.
The military received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the king of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to that post.
The 60-year-old soldier who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the post.
He was elected prime minister at the meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Praut Chan-Och, conversion was the only way to maintain stability.
It had been preceded by continued six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded resignations from the Government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Prait Chan-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military are planning to hold a general election at the end of 2015.
However, there is a fear that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
Military authorities came to power on 22 May
In the background of the full paralysis of the civil authority.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the arrival of the military, they had been arrested by the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is taking root in 2006, when the army has moved from the post of Prime Minister of Brother Yinglyk Chinawatt Taxin.
Both of them enjoy the popularity of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has often made them successful in the elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elite representatives have joined the anti-government movement, which has practically paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that there would be a better place in the media room. I didn't promise you that.
It must be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain intact.
They've long known that we're saying "Belgium" -- we're saying "Media," we're saying "Media" -- we're saying "Belgium".
Restaurants like to say deeply that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and relocation.
There's places like this that's not for good, but for good, but for good, but for bad.
In short, sitting behind Palm's capital, I remembered that once there was a coffee "The City" (in honor of the same television broadcaster), then "Odesa Mother", and another restaurant "The God" and "The Beer of the Society".
Now it's beer again, but it's no longer nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Above the ground was only the tip of the iceberg: a bar stand and a pair of chairs, all the rest of the space was deprived of even a sign of sunlight.
That's why it's fun here, like in the baby's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows -- televisions where girls are floating.
The Belgian institutions in Petersburg haven't been in the news for a long time, so there's something to compare.
Here are eight types of brewing (260-300 rubles per 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive officer is happy to present the menu, telling us that "midi is a small seed", and it should be noted that, despite certain shortcomings, the service is the most positive side of Palm.
It is expected by content, but often very unexpected by execution.
Who, for example, is supposed to have a meat roll with a wallon black (280 rubles) - in fact, a rock cut to the same extent so thin that the parchment paper will prove to be immeasurably thick compared to it.
It's possible to feel something like that, only if you get a pair of sweatshirts together.
It's worse with salads.
The classic Lazy (260) would be best recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some sloppy iceberg opened once a long time ago by a mapo, a dry Kenyan beans, alevelian chips from the bacon plus some marined bow.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a fake salad!
The composition of ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes to the unadulterated quarters of tomatoes or roasted champagne, why do the media seem to have managed to freeze and open them several times for their lives!
Because I already know that there are perfectly normal white-sea meds here!
They are placed in the spoons "in the sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, that from white wine, celery and carrots, have not been exposed.
There are fruits, and there's no aroma, whether there's wine or not, it's still a mystery.
That's why it's good for the media to have a frit with a home mayonnaise.
The chicken water here is not a dish, so thick that depending on your mood, you can choose the first or the second dish before you, but just a nice sip.
It was claimed that the rabbit prepared a local chicken in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosmarin.
The situation on the roof was diametrically opposite: rosmarin drowned everything.
It seemed that this rabbit had been fed exclusively with rosemary coustics, the meat of which had acquired such unusual aromas.
But at the same time, the rabbit was attached to the leg with a remarkable -- no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Waffles in Palm are offered not only sweet, but also small, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The cane sauce turned out to be too waterproof, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the dishes.
So you have to come back.
The exchange rate of the dollar rose to over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia under the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar for tomorrow at 10:29 a.m. rose by 26.9 p.m. and was 37.02 p.m., and the price rose by 30 p.m. to 48.73 p.m., according to the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The bivalent cortex grew by 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and stood at 42.28 rubles.
Until the Crimean Events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009, and on 3 March 2014, it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that the President of the United States, Barack Obama and Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
Weaknesses of rubble are long-term and in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast meant this mark, says senior analyst Alpari Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, there is no evidence of military invasion, but the market has become very emotional.
All the talks that he had been able to hold on to such news were overwritten yesterday.
The week, according to the expert, will be close to 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine is all connected to one chain.
The inflation gap is also forecast: current autumn prices will be increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal fruit and vegetables will soon end, and some vacuum will occur until networks are redirected to other suppliers.
“The dollar came to the mark in 37 rubles, passed it back and back, there was no powerful estuary,” said the head of the market analysis department, “Opening Broker” Constantine Bushev.
Still to be seen whether or not the sanctions promised will be imposed on Saturday, as will be imposed by NATO.
Rubl said he had become very weak after the tax season had ended, and then news had been sent to Ukraine, and last week the CB said that it was moving to a floating course before the end of the year and refused any currency intervention.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was nothing different from the previous month, all of which scared the mark into 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
Yeah, there's nothing going on in the traffic.
The alarming times for the currency market were, I recall, when the demand for the currency was high at the end of January, as well as the third of March, when the CB released a record of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the decrease in rubella.
First of all, this is an increase in the export budget as well as the competitiveness of domestic producers through the costing of imports, says UFS IC Alexei Kozlov, the main analyst.
There are negative moments when imports of goods and services can be carried out.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, increased inflationary pressure, and, as a result, have led to the escalation of the borrowing of money, which, in turn, has slowed the development of the country ' s economy.
With regard to the stock market, the depreciation of rubles somewhat slows down the prices of the shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the IMF trade index fell by 1.67% on Thursday and the RTS index lost 3.27% on Thursday.
Such a significant difference in the relative rate of index decrease is due to a decrease in rubella over the day of more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakness of the rubble is emotional and is due to a strong desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, emotions are gradually disappearing, and rubble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic violation is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she had spent many years thinking that she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had lived for several years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a Sharco-Mari-Tut's disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside the brain and the spinal cord.
The charitable organization CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with SMT because it was not known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are suspected of having SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unassuming movements and swollen legs.
Patients may experience oedema or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from the attack of Friedrich (AF) was a condition that was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be attached to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "With Rebecca, I knew I couldn't do what others could do.
I fell down every day, and I had more time for everything.
I could never get into roles or skateboards with other kids, and I had to spend a lot of time at school because of how I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to free her fingertips and straighten her feet, she looked into a medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I had a nose that wasn't right, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information on this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tried the most horrible panic, as far as possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair in 18 and I'd die before I was 25 and that I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor for it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to your life.
After a few genetic surveys, she found SMT.
"When he explained what SMT is, I thought it was a happy ticket," she said.
The United Kingdom SMT charity has announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area is increasing as the economy is restored
The recovery economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
Tax accounts for state and local companies across the country have increased moderately last year, when economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and a company in the Washington area is not an exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion in the state and at the local level in financial year 2013, by 3.8 per cent more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses increased by 4.3 per cent last year, up to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third year of growth after years of decline in accounts in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes collected by the State grew faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the study carried out by the company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56 per cent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax income is taxed on companies.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to the continued value of company real estate, researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the majority of these incomes come from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $10 billion in State and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the return to real estate has no similar effect on state and local income growth in Maryland, where real estate taxes hardly exceed one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia are paying about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Colombia, belongs to either the Government or a non-profit organization that does not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in corporate tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneur's income also appears to be being adjusted according to this data.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, at $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from income tax, mostly in the region.
Although trends are in one direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Colombia was at the same level as the country ' s average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were higher than the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which had the same corporate rate) was 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia taxes are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and generally more favourable for corporate taxes than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax income targets next year, this law could lead to income tax rates for entrepreneurs up to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure for which the majority of small companies - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes on entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business tax throughout the country is likely to remain this year, with income from trade in Governments and at the local level increasing by 6.2 per cent for the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be left behind, as the reduction in federal expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Jew
The domestic champion of the Jewish world brought to Russia a collection of two silver and seven bronze prizes.
According to this indicator, the Russians have only joined the main competitions in Japan.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and on the very first day, the Russian team brought a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who spoke up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the final fight against Baldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was decided by only one comment received by the Russian.
And this is the second day of the tournament that has become the most successful for Russia's assembly - three medals were immediately won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was achieved by Michael Pulayev, and the bronze was Kamal Han Magomedev.
In the final round, the Russians won the 2011 and 2013 World Peace Championship by Japanese Massasi Ebinume.
Khan Magomedov, at the fourth-final stage of the losing compatriot, won a comforting tournament and became the winner of the bronze prize.
In the women's tournament, up to 52 kg, also to the third stage of the Pedestal, Natalia Kuzutina arrived.
In the semi-final, she lost the current Milinda Kelmendi World Championship from Kosovo, which was under the flag of the International Federation of Jews and successfully protected the title.
Kuzutina won Ma Inan from China in the bronze dispute, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that the third place was not exactly what she was counting on.
And then again, the Russian roadblock to gold became Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzutina earlier at the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the Chelabinsk Bronze Tournament, Mosa Moguškov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg, set up in a Russian rally.
In the quarter-end, he became the former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skvorcov, now a member of the OAU team.
But then the Russian won two awards and became the winner of the prize.
Moguškov was speaking at the home championship with the injury of the golenostope, which he planned to cure soon, so he would take a break in the competitions.
As for the former Moldovan Squortz, he and he reached the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, Ivan Remarenko and his fellow member, who had adopted OAU's sporting citizenship, had completed the performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
On the fourth day, CM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which, in the category up to 81 kg, was won by Ivan Nifontov.
He won the Frenchman Alan Schmidt in a difficult fight against the small final by commenting on the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were immediately played, but Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze in the male tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questiono, and the Russian Consular Medal was guaranteed: his compatriot for the comforting final was Kirill Denisov.
However, the very idea was lacking: the opponent of Question was unable to get out of Dad because of the trauma.
The man's bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of the competition, she was put in a collection pile by Renat Sayid, who spoke in the category of more than 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moore.
That was the end of the individual part of the world.
On the last day of the Chelabinsk tournament, on Sunday, the names of the world’s champions were played in command competitions.
Both Russians, male and female, were one of the main prize applicants, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex did not get lucky until the medal.
And here the Russian Jews won the order silver.
In the face of the decisive opposition, they have joined Japan ' s main competitions team in the ongoing struggle with account 2-3.
The Russian Constituencies were 2-0 after the pure victory of Han Magomedov and the will of Dennis Yarzev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese opponents, Murat Habibirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) failed.
The same scenario also developed a bronze match in a women's tournament, where the Russian collective, led by 2-0, joined the Japanese 2-3.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at a team meeting in Chelabinska, who congratulated the man with silver after the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was evident that you could be champions," said Putin, whose word is "News."
To lose the Japanese, the Jewish family, there's nothing strange about this.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian assembly at the World Home Championship was much better than the year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
However, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstein and Mansur Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximists.
Yeah, they want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a man in the Olympics is in the eight strongest, he's the potential winner of the Olympics.
The more sports like Jews," said the Minister of Sports of the RF Vitaly Mutko, whose words are being quoted by the press service of the champion.
The congregation in Japan was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, winning 11 medals of various honors, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next world championship will take place next year in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers is unconscious of the hospital's arrival in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in her statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after the emergency call that she had had a heart attack at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscope.
Doctors will deliberately keep her under the narcos and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition that remains “hard”.
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such sources as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the Kings Can
The debut album of the Royal Blood Group is a new hope for the British Year, which brought rock-dudes out of the clubs directly to the stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood is on the stage all year long, but he already has an active nomination for the BBC music award, an Arctic Monkeys heat tour, and a visit to a New York concert by Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut single album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before release, and the contract for its issue is in the Major Label Warner Music portfolio.
Given the current situation in the music market, the situation is emerging from a number of waves, because it is not the new Lane Del Ray or the regular sweet-sweet representative of the new R'n'B, but the duet of British bullies playing with the noise and intensity that was last in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the rates on the first album in relation to all the above circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
Duet did not see himself taking the name that he had previously been able to reach that very desperate hairy metallists, and the blood of which kings they seem to have in their homes, also understood.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like a large quarter, Royal Blood is aiming to hold the standing blood of the British year, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this company so far, please, it's wounded, but something can already be claimed.
Ten of the songs posted in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal composer ' s gift as a credible and powerful statement of intentions.
Some of the dignity of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered, not by a melodic line, but by a drumming party.
The musicians in the joke say that this song is easier to beat than to get drunk.
It is also worth assigning the powerful Little Monster and closing the plastic "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearen quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of heavy-year lovers, but when they are played, they often blend into a more or less uniform canvas.
And that's not necessarily bad, even on the contrary.
The Royal Blood force is that they do not claim to be in Lennon and McCartney's labs (they're already in Motörhead inheritances), but they've got a lot of rock-doos out of the Indi Clubs.
Their music, despite some variety created for stadiums, is obviously close to a space of less than a thousand people.
The secret to the clever use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format thought to be the zeros.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the very approach to the composition of the songs.
The returned heroes of zeroes were very hard chosen beyond the postmodernist paradigm, and were reluctant to acknowledge themselves not just by epigons but by independent creative units.
The Royal Blood is now so powerful and sudden that this effort is successfully draining some of the secondaryity and stiffness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online Store - and Video Producer, and hundreds of other things - buys the Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise, not because nobody expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling the Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flow service -- a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their internal moments; YouTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And "let's play", a genre of videomakers who are familiar with (mainly, old) gaming, like in the Secret Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The fact that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without any particular interest, a classic example of a leading technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, considering that, according to the information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
The snobbies like me, who say that they're going to be better at sports than watching it, are hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the jostics themselves.
One thing is to look through each other's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she walks through Resident Evil, and the other thing is to look at how a remote person gets 20 shots in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so to look at them without control of the angle of vision can be a prescription of the main pain that is worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the fast paces in which the Rogers Bennisters of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are fun.
But if this isn't about the game virtuoso or the humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting.
But what do skeptics know about me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, the fourth of which is the source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is turning to Amazon Instant Video as clearly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has what any company would be pleased to receive: a crowd of young men who are dreamt of by advertisers.
As head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future game," and this channel doesn't give the signs of the intruder, even -- oh -- like a visionary kind of sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages - almost all of them now, students, parents of the deceased, the city of Angelov, Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the "Materi Beslana" committee of Susan Dudiev, who was involved in a special operation by a member of the Ministry of Social Affairs of Elizavet Antonov, who was working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President of the North Caucasus and was negotiating with terrorists, as well as with the FSB management officer of Russia, Wiacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic is that in Beslane there was not one of these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for all who have a bearing on it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
Travel impressions are very difficult.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
The project is prepared by Rambler & Co, who has been working in the company since spring this year.
The previous specific projects were devoted to the First World War and to the 15-year stay of Vladimir Putin.
The CNDR launched a small-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range rocket in the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
Approximately 10.30 a.m. was launched locally by the province of Chagando, on the border of North Korea and China.
Supposedly, the rocket crashed in the Japanese Sea, about 220 kilometres away, declared in the Joint Committee of South Korean Headquarters.
Deputies have suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
The House introduced a bill to transfer the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower court.
Its authors were Mr. Wadim Deignin, Mr. Yaroslav Nelov (LDPR), Mr. Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Mr. Vladimir Parahin (Justice Russia) and Mr. Alexander Euštenko (KPRF).
This change will, in the opinion of the initiative, contribute to the more expeditious and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the RF to the preservation of personal data and to the confidentiality of the census on information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, which is speeded up by parliamentarians, obliges us to keep in the territory of RF personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes mandatory records, systematization, collection, storage, clarification and collection of personal data of RF citizens in databases located in the territory of Russia, as well as information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the law entitles Rosomnadzer to restrict access to information processed in violation of RF personal data law on the basis of a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of offender sites, an automated information system “Register of personal data subjects rights”.
This law was adopted by the House in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugova and Wadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yušhenko from CRC.
Money and Juštenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Anyone who doesn't have an RF data center will have to pay for the rent
Commenting today on the draft law of the first chapter of the Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see any problem with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Privacy Act.
According to him, companies that will not have their own Russian personal data storage capacity on the territory of the RF by 1 January 2015 will be able to rent them, for example, in Rostelekoma, who said repeatedly that they are willing to provide their servers for rent and already provide their servers, in Mail Group, with Western companies that are already providing their servers today.
"There are also several independent centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the RF, I don't see any problems - they'll get technological opportunities for placement," said Levin.
Dispute Bill
As soon as the draft law was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association feared that if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, this is about online airline and hotel maintenance services.
According to the Association, “the bill deprives individuals of the right of citizens of the Russian Federation to have their own data in order to determine that their registration, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stresses that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism for the recording of personal data.
In such a case, they will be able to choose the territory on which such action will take place.
The adoption of such personal data “localization” laws in other countries has resulted in the care of global services and substantial economic losses.
The ice water test was carried out on the jaw
Isabel Roberts, from Britain, cried so much when her head was rubbed with ice water that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she sobbed during the cold water test that she raised her jaw.
Isabell Roberts screamed so furiously when her head was poured with ice water that it damaged her face.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did it, my jaw began to tremble," she said.
Water's flying for 20 years.
Isabel Roberts in seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't shut, it stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to beg, but I had to take me to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to the hospital to take the lead after participating in the popular engagement on Tuesday.
Clip became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia transferred more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In the Novorossia Army, they claim to have beaten the Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the opponent of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia transferred 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of which were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by the press representative of the Novorossia Army.
He added that “the force of the WFP in the area of the Mereška human settlements would crash Su-27 in violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the Agency's interviewer, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the artillery shooting of the Lugano airport.
The representative of the press noted that the militias had been able to damage two Ukrainian VAS helicopters at one of the field airports, as well as destroy two drone carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The persecution of the enemy in the live force -- up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people were arrested," said a staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formation of the “national republics” of Donbass declared the transfer to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, at night, the DND army, according to the Novorossia Army, “interrupted the attempt of the Naggwarts to break the agreements previously reached to remove heavy-duty technology from the area of the environment”.
Then the colonels reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the staff, the total enemy losses in all directions (Doneck, Lugansk, Mariupolski) were five tanks, eight armoured war cars, more than 120 people killed and wounded that night.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers appeared in the vicinity of the militias in the Addis Ababa area.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, requested the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the area.
The DND agreed to do so, provided that the weapon and ammunition were handed over by the opponent.
The first tens of military personnel began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbass Semenchenko, 14 more people left the castle on Sunday.
In his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded were “in custody of 137-dollar 32 divisions of RF and 9 tank squads of RF” where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the IMI and the Russian Minoband rejected reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MIDI RF: Russia will take responses to the introduction of new sanctions in the EU
Russia reserves the right to take response measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the TIRExB.
The Russian Foreign Office's communication states that the European Council's conclusions of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inexorable support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of the country”, the Agency said.
The TIRExB regrets that, contrary to the interests of its Member States, Eurosocet is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening their confrontation with Russia.
Members of the Euros Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the Bureau stressed.
It is also noted on the Office ' s website that there are currently no targeted assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place and the number of victims is increasing among the peaceful population.
We recall that the European Union is planning to develop concrete proposals for sanctions against the RF during the next seven weeks.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with US officials.
They are expected to be correlated with the measures in place for the period of action and severity.
The new EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, financial and oil industry.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,100 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, planned a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system for taking books to senior students, offering them a nominal compensation for delaying their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually costs $180, got me $10 for the semester and Chick-file-A," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The reading of the books is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often it is much cheaper than buying it.
Nibo Incorporateid, which is owned by over 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of books has increased twice since 2011.
The industry's studies show that about four books in university bookstores were taken on hold during last spring's semester, says Vice-President Nebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the professional association “National Association of University Shops”.
This is an introduction course in the best way to make a profit transaction.
Buying online stores
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 per researcher, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the detainee
If you're not against other notes or injuries, the textbooks held are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a retained form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassedy, 25 years old, a fourth-rate student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a supported copy of the “Strategic Decisions in the Media: Understanding of the Business side of the Advertising Business”.
The book was sold for $48 a new one.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracy, director of the College of Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to clarify with their professors whether previous publications can be used.
At times, updates are not relevant for occupations.
In such cases, the old editions can often be found at very little cost.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com owned by "eBay Inc." is a popular alternative for the purchase of books held.
Rocate
To take the textbooks, you have to think if you're good enough to talk to them, don't forget to bring them back and don't want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to take a six-month math analysis for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you are taking books, including any fines that may be issued for notes, highlights and injuries.
If you take the book, remember: if you don't return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are taken over by e-licensing for a certain period of time by distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematic Analysis" project on the Chegg.com website for six months will be about $61.
Braci says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classics can now jump free of charge, while natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start studying at the law school Pepperdin, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text.
Before ordering on the Internet, Golt says, make sure that the book is in stock.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he acquired was delayed for four weeks, and, at the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated the complete inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced at the meeting on the maintenance of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the Budget Investment Fund for the Development of the Far East, established two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles are still on the deposits," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State was instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of developing countries in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the TOROs should be introduced into the House this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, by 1 July, noted that it had not approved the list of developing countries in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving transport accessibility in the region, removing infrastructure constraints, both on the internal market and for export development.
In addition, there is a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as for the development of the area of development, which should be competitive in relation to the key ADR business centres, the President stressed.
Remember, it was previously reported that the border development area could replace the OECD.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save cash collection
Sylvester Stalone's "Inconstant 3" returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget to the United States, while "The City of Sins: the woman to whom to kill" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz has only brought $14.6 million in the first outings, while children's movies, such as "How to Hand Dragon 2" are also disappointing.
The film critic Telegraph Robbie Collina points out that when it comes to children ' s films, it may be a matter of bad quality.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year in all history with regard to children's films and called "How to Hand Dragon 2" an "unusual" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at older audiences, it seems that the problem does not necessarily exist as films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that went out in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July for 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account both filmmakers and film critics, suggest that the crop of the films this year resembles the caliber of last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing eye habits and growing popularity of streaming internet services, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-paced Disney film called the Book of Jungle, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We must acknowledge this and not try to push for what was before.
Unlike the current fall in cash collection in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the flow generation service reached $1.2 billion, almost double the previous year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spillberg criticised the studios because they relied too much on comic strips, and predicted Hollywood's prey.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that his dark predictions were a part of the truth.
Because in the summer of 2015, several potential cash hits are expected, including the “Messengers: Erya Altrona”, the “Minionov” and the “York Park”, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Human X producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collection just "cyclical," Hollywood Reporter said: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with caucasian and middle Asian food, but for restaurants in the European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, imports of banned products are still preferable not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little salty gourmet than a bad mozarel," said the Italian restaurant's chief barlotti Mariano Valerio is breaking down about the quality of cheeses offered by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozarella and the cheese of the storm ended up in the restaurant first, they had a little storage time.
Parmesan stockpiles should be sufficient for a few months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such an eye, which is clear: Shocking memories do not leave him so far.
The meat there lay on the calves all the way down 30 inches [30 cm] from the sex!
There's balls!
Chris!
Then I said we'd never buy anything for our restaurant in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed now.
But in the days I was taken to a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be naked!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common to Italy for a Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at 1-2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to get soft to relax the muscles.
I've done all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that soft meat?
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes' walk from Barlotti, at the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge, the kitchen has a stop list indicating the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chief of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Shot Bar Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color coat is 200 rubles!
I'm like, "Why is it so expensive?"
I'm told, "We've got to earn, too."
But this coat shouldn't cost 80 rubles!
We're buying the Far East oysters by weight, but they live between 15 and 20 years, do you imagine how much does their basket weigh?
At the price, it's a super-delicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear of foreign spills.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell. "
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what will happen to them when cheese supplies are finished

The Sanctions Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are essentially called product sanctions.
The import of bovine, porcine, meat and by-products from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, garlic, cheese, vegetables, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited.
Restaurants have started a supply chain: prices for products have grown, and we need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
This will most strongly affect expensive restaurants with the French, Italian, and Spanish mono-coursies, where products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The survey had to be refurbished before.
For example, when at the beginning of 2014, Rosselkhoznaztor banned the import of Australian beef and earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In exchange for suppliers, supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand have been made.
But summer-2014 sanctions were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which derive from the prohibition of boys from the Atlantic salmon and furloughs, unsweetened milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, mountain and garlic for sowing.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be mitigated.
While some restaurants still exist in uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the percentage of imports in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"The road restaurants will have to change the menu by producing local farmers and other countries," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner of Restconsalt.
If the boss is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few of these gaps, and a new menu can be developed for two or three months.
The tricycle from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready: it will take 10-15 per cent of the drive, and half of the menu will have to be reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, there are already beginning to replace candles, such as steak from marbled beef on befstrogans, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - Oxan Glibchuk is the representative of East-West.
Strawberries and milk products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon from Norway, a salmon from the seventh, a fur from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of fruits and vegetables from European production could be offset by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants would be transformed more easily than the premium segment: there were hardly any gurmans that could distinguish Italian mozarel from Russian.
Although it is difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he considers it difficult.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and its menus.
""" says Mironov.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the lack of owners in the country.
The coffee owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic in Europe
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions are practically unaffected.
These include Chinese cuisine: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and coffee "Wy me!".
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on a lot of cheese, chicken file, we don't use exotic greens."
In Kolbay's institutions, they haven't removed a single monitor from the menu yet.
Timura Lansky, owner of Chihona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not disturbed by the sanctions: he will only have to change his lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia sets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will cost us more than imports from Europe, he says.
The U.S.A. may cost you a cut, lamb, tomatoes, onions, and fruits.
What is being brought from Central Asia is much better than plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
That's not what anyone says about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan, Olymbia Artikov, said that he planned to increase exports of fruit and vegetables to Russia by two by 2016.
The intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions was stated by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Restaurants of fast food that responded to Deneg's request also respond fairly calmly to sanctions.
The McDonald's Press Service stated that the location was 85 per cent higher and the network was working with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanov, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of Russia ' s products buy the network, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of fruit and increased prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
The term “licensing products” was not more than 4 per cent at all.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the "Wokker" pass.
KFC, Burger King and Short Cartoche did not respond to Deneg's request, but other market participants claimed that the location of Burger King was significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian long-east
On your back.
As long as restaurants complain that the demand for price increases even for local products.
"Prices for Grables have grown on average by 10-15%, for the Italian Cherry Mio restaurant, twice," says Roman Rožnikovski's restaurant.
Even in Georgian restaurants, self-esteem will grow by 5-10 per cent, Kolbaya admits.
"East Western" does not deny this: "For example, Belarus's milk production has traveled 10-15% since early August."
“Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pig almost twice,” complains Sergey Rak, Deputy Director General Stardogs.
Chickens traveled 35% a short time.
We're waiting for China's price, maybe they're going to smell the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8 per cent.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth in the total survey for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator since 2010.
Various prices will continue to grow, he admits, but not as quickly as possible: as long as most restaurants have been left with products for the next two months in the hope of overhauling purchase prices.
But what will happen two months later, no one knows.
There are dozens of tents decorated with greenery and wood on the square in front of the Moscow Mary.
At the center of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
It's a regional product festival called "There's a Time."
"We've been going to make a local food festival for a long time, and here's just the sanctions, we've got drunk, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
At the scene with Greek musicians, Anastas prepared salad from pasta and homemade confectionery, during the days he was a master's class in the preparation of a boat with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are certified by the organizers.
In tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian population.
Honey from Baschiria, an olive tree from Salehard, fruit from the Mosquito "Sovhoza Name Lenin", cheeses from the surrounding Italian Jay Clouseum.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by another salmon stock fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish cage "Your Men" Philip Galkin.
We've got a kidney, a cat, a cock, a cock, a cock, a king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as the Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, he won't even move.
And you won't hold our far east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian Mozart national
In the window of his tent lies the beds with the "Magadan", the rafter, the omelet, the muxun, the midies with the Crimea, the greeks from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's been a while since he's been fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, more than 4 million tonnes of fish in Russia in 2013 are fish, and a large proportion of fish are from Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are approximately 800 000 tonnes.
His people have been working since 2012, selling fish through the Internet store, serving half a dozen more restaurants before sanctions were introduced, such as Simple Things.
There are now 15 more restaurants in Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, he's burning.
We're stuck. We've tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheap several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation in the Hallkin tent, they're making me a portion of Philadelphia with a chain.
Unlike scrolls with seven, they have to live longer, but knowing that this fish, our native fish, gives us strength.
There's even rolls from the coat and the sea urchins on the website of your people.
In sushi bars, it is true that replacing Norwegian salmon is preferable to Chilean.
Galkin explains this by saying that I'm trying to make new recipes with the Far East fish.
"Russian fish suppliers haven't offered us yet," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take advantage of the free market, but that did not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimov project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America are now more likely to be replaced.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace banned imports unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the biggest producers in other countries have won from the ban," Akim says.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result of the mass out-of-date checks by Rosusenasur, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants for visitors as soon as possible," the McDonald's press said.
No one really understands what's going to happen.
If all is limited to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived - says anonymity of a restaurant consultant.
If McDonald's is to be closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of GIBDD manuals
Cash payments can be obtained without the advice of the GBDD, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that, from 1 September of this year, an insured passenger car will be able to pay for the helmet without an IBDAD.
The truth is, it is only in cases where an accident was designed under the Europrotocol without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the DTP, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the Europrotocol ceiling is 50 thousand rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will increase to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in situations where the DTP can be developed under the Europrotocol, drivers in an accident are causing the DPS.
If there was a police force, the helmet could not be recovered without the IGID.
The parameters contained in the draft guidance are intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of the helmet due to the DTP made without the GIBDD staff should not be lower than the limit for the Europrotocol.
However, it cannot be above the limit laid down in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is, of course, useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and roads.
But it's probably not gonna get hit by cars or insurance.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules on cash payments.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the excellent Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for the inspector to form a small accident because it is more reliable.
And yet it is not known what will be easy to defeat fraud or convince drivers of the reliability of the Europrotocol.
Saving certificate to be named and unrevocable
Minfin wants to ban the supplier ' s savings certificates, so he will allow banks to make them the like of a non-revocable contribution.
Minfin prepares a bill that prohibits the applicant ' s retention certificates.
Recently, this instrument has gained popularity, since rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
It is the case that the deposit insurance system does not fall under the sponsor's savings certificates, and the bank does not have to make any payments to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASB).
The fact that this step is planned to be taken by small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and are affected by Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, accounts for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem explained in ASU is that the clients of a small bank who bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money in ASU if they withdraw it.
Some investors who do not have sufficient financial literacy and purchase savings certificates may assume that their investments are insured.
Reasoned lack of insurance payments for these certificates may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions when the bank withdraws the licence.
In practice, there were cases where the holders of the submission certificates tried to obtain an insurance refund through the court," said ASU.
The problem is, of course, thoughtful.
There would be no one to pay certificates to buyers, since they do not have the right to reimbursement by the State under law.
If it were the case that the instrument was not insured in ASV, it would also prohibit the metal accounts, which would include the funds of citizens in the grams of one of four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are also not included in the deposit insurance system, but they are not yet being tried.
It is likely that certificates on the presenter are a very convenient valuable paper that can actually act as a quasi-corporation.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of a bank may purchase a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and may change many owners before such a certificate is found.
The draft law did not, however, stipulate that the certificate should be a mandatory security document, which should be stored in a depositary.
To satisfy the pill to banks, such certificates may be issued without the right to early payment.
That is to say, there is a analogy between a non-revocable contribution that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the centre of Newport on the march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's rathouse for what was described as an antisammite.
Steven Fairclau was watching us for the development of events during the departures and talking to protestors who came all the way from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank facilities to Iraq
Germany will place weapons in Iraq to counter the terrorists from the Islamic State, reports ITAR-TASS on 31 August, referring to a decision taken following the meeting of the Frag Government, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes to Iraq and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 storm rifles.
The supplies will be implemented by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to humanitarian aid to Iraq.
1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a statement by the Government on the subject.
So far, Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the inhabitants of the FWG on the dispatch of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State; others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The settlers submerged the Ukrainian Patrol Cat in the Azov Sea
The Donetian settlers submerged a Ukrainian patrol cat in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TASS reported on 31 August.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported shooting two yards of coastal protection.
It is said that the incident occurred today about 16:20 ms.
Adolescents took a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO young Bushookers were delivered to the helicopter safely after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
The 16-year-old girl and the 18-year-old went on their way soon after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackchet.
Concerned relatives called the police about eight nights before they returned home.
A search team was sent, which included local police and rescue teams, and a couple found about 11 evenings around the Bridal Valley Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the young man fell and sneezed his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night and picked them up at the dormitory on Monday morning.
They were taken to the ambulance in a stable condition at the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two Unions meeting
The Summit negotiations in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened but gave birth to a new format: the first European Union members met with the first members of the future Eurasian
Let me be alarmed (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time have discussed a number of “burning problems”.
If such a structure is capable of working effectively, it is inconceivable; therefore, it is clear who took the slips off the summit.
The questions were answered on the evening of 26 August when the Belarusians, followed by other Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader was an example of politeness, which was the behavior of a man who had just broken the Jackpot - and planned a decent age in high society.
How Maydan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk immediately by three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to make a final briefing on their behalf, not simply legitimizing the President with a 20-year term.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a fully-fledged European political entity and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarus Institute of Strategic Research Denis Meljancov is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak with Minsk as before.
"What Katherine Ashton has met with Aunt Lukashenko gives us reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze," he said.
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparations for the break-up of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Mayan in Kiev in 2013.
“The results have also been achieved with the EU – successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernisation,” says the interviewer, Firenka, and international security negotiations have been conducted with the United States.
The States have even lifted a few sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian developments, they themselves, and the reaction of the leadership of Belarus, have only undermined the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
With another, a Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Prossion militias in Donbass with all seriousness, he did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not come from the Customs Union or the DRC, and the Russian air base was located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, confident by the Belarusian experts.
As long as Lukashenko's movement for political diversification is successful, it will be seen how often Minsk will have to meet in the form of EU+TS.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Katherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Cosijannic just said "Fire," that the issue was not a priority in the face of war and peace.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in a new format could also take place in Kazakhstan.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev's statement, which he acknowledged was made by the representatives of the Euro Union, was made by the Capillary of the Deity for Minsk.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not oppose the keeping of Minsk as a central venue for meetings in the form of both Russia -- OSCE -- Ukraine and the Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is a fully-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
A Better Friend of the European Farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, including the European Trade and Energy Commissioners, had already stressed the conclusion: the main cover of the summit was not a tragic situation in Donbass, but an economy.
Indeed, the timing of future negotiations on gas supply and the overcoming of the concerns of the TC countries on the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be more extensive than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Nevertheless, the Commissioner for Trade Carl De Gucht said: EU representatives “come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic implications rather than the opposite.”
It seems, however, that in Ukraine's economy, the crisis is also “working” towards Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are giving Minsk, which is still experiencing the sanctioning pressure, a long-lasting field for manoeuvre.
According to the Head of the Mises Research Centre, former candidate for the Presidents of Belarus, Yaroslav Romancuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus ' s ability to supply agricultural products to the FP in the form of sanctions.
Delivery schemes are being put forward for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk at the summit.
"Initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk Firenku, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long developed supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business is urgently needed to restore them, even through Belarusian structures.
The second topic, - the expert continues - relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies will not be able to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials as well as the direction of the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have around $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarus's trade schemes can now be very demanding."
In Romania's view, the role of the owner of the EU and TS negotiations area is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic links with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU agrarian sector from Moscow's sanctions was estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission was currently offering farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact of Eurofarmers.
This can raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk has been rejected for its active role in the birth of TS+EU format, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev has become the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, without delay, to discuss, not with the bartenders to decide, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was then in Ukraine," he turned to the Chambers of Petru Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, and it was said that it initially opposed the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, it is very careful to stress that Belarus is not pursuing useful objectives when organising EU and TC interactions on its land, but the ultimate goal of this form is the establishment of a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to the government.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, particularly in the area of security, advance and promote the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said Firenka in the mid-belorusia department, where words have been sloppy lately.
In Moscow, a pay-as-you-go zone can be found
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of a pay-as-you-go zone as a means of combating the overload of central roads similar to other major cities of the world, conveys M24.ru with reference to the Mayor of Moscow on the transport of Maxim Lixutova.
One option that has been successful in recommending itself is payment.
It's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, look at all the minuses and pluses.
To say that some decisions have been taken in this regard until early," Liksutov said.
Zimmera stressed that it was very important for the authorities of the capital to experience Asian cities that were similar to Moscow in terms of structure and load.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central motorway already under way, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of not necessarily all traffic passing through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the train, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the mayor.
Maxim Liksutov also stated that the introduction of pay parks had significantly depleted the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop what they had achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobianin, attended the construction ceremony of the first Moscow Central Wheelroad (CCAD) launch complex.
Backend is not valid
The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins-2: The woman who deserves to be killed" did nothing but the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), which was removed with minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, led to a revolution in the relationship between cinema, comics and literature.
Syquel is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamentals for modern thinking the string "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if understood under this space nuar, and under antithesis - the space of comics).
From now on, it should be read: "Thesis - Antithesis - Chaos."
"The City of Sins-2" is chaotic at both the dramatic and the philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the stupid sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first Town, although, here's the Tomb of Marv (Micky Rourk), he remembers that life ended on an electric chair, and here, nothing else, he only manages to capture -- as an esophagus of a people's wife -- from the air of a knife and other punches.
But the old people are literally dislodged by the arcs of the novels, like those that break into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and purpose of which the viewers ask not to worry.
Yes, his story, shamelessly confused by the authors in the most interesting place, was with the successful game of Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is a fertilized Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for some revenge on her dueita (Jos Brolin).
But this mess in which Dwight, let's say, doesn't make a difference between Johnny -- the more people, like other parts of the body, the more people wear characters with incredible regularity -- not trouble or even poverty.
They're not people, but we understand that they're the archetypes of the nuar: a year-old bitch who's too sure of herself to play a game that's in the "sweet hunting" of a detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetyphal waltzs with an archetype and an archetyphal chase, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract cartoon.
It's funny to ask abstract drawings about the logic of the plot.
Moreover, even in this troubled world, there is something permanent.
The warheads of the first "City" continue to defend themselves against the siege of their native forces of darkness.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and he's gonna look at the fire, and Bruce Willis is always happy to look.
The main problem of the City of Sin-2 is that of another.
Frank Miller was happy to see how a cartoonist combined comics and nuar talent and as a director turned around the idea of how to carry comics on the screen.
Comics and nuars are two aggressively opposite realities.
The phenomenon of a modern-day comic was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammet's Bloody Grain (1929), the Maltese Skull (1930) and the Glass Key (1931) established a canon of a nourar called the then hard-boiled school - a "hard school".
Well, or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seamen of Papaya, the spider eater that gives him rich power, Superman, Batman and the rescuer Dick Tracy to Halka, Tora, Spider Man and other "vindictors".
But in any movie about comics, there was something harmful: the cartoon characters didn't want to grow on the screen, they remained hostages in the surrounding world of their will-slaves "real" world.
I'm just saying, they were completely deprived of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After World War II, the traditional novel, with its experiences, character, family scandals and the historical background, lost all confidence.
What Forsets, what are the Tibo and Rugon McCarres, what are the Balkan and Rosts in general thought after Verden, Osvenzim and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated in the form of a charity, and a criminal, that is, a marginalist, has, according to the definition, increased to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet on his skin found out what it's like to be a sanitizer on the front.
He was a communist.
As it turns out, they were at least close to the company and genre columns such as the authors Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Jules Dassen, Joseph Lauzie, Edward Dmitrick.
So the kidney, the archetype they gave, first, rough and cynical, and secondly, is totally social.
I don't think that's an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable because it was unnatural, but organically linked the comics with the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, the comics were alive, not feeling close to their graphic nature, and not becoming a "present" film.
The dark of the sale of peace, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered the monster son of a sadist, was quite worthy of the Hammet.
And the graphic details of the cut-off heads that the sadist decorated with his nest, before the brilliant James Elroy, author of the Black Orchid, and better -- that is, a declarative tortoise -- a representative of the neonaure.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical stylistic of Miller-- Rodriguez before the comics tradition.
It's probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins," you feel trapped in a glass layer, where the snow drenched a toy.
However, it's usually not snow, it's blood clots, but what difference does it make?
Well, it's about socialism and nothing to say.
For it is possible only when, at some point, we have something to do with the dirt, but there is a normal world where we can bring the girl back on the wrong track or say to the restless parents that her destroyer is punished.
And when there is no place for sin in the city, there is no sin, but there is no sin therein: neither is there any sin therein, but it is righteousness.
It's boring, like any rule.
Chaos "The City of Sin-2" is just boring.
For righteousness ’ sake, the domestic sparrow gave this fine sin a small one but a small one.
The headlines warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With regard to the scene, in the very vegetarian episode where a person is being beaten with his fingers, it gives way to a hell of a mood.
Hemmet would like it.
The Socialists of France must “shut up and bring France in order”, says key ally Frasua Holland
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to “demonstrate a warm relationship” with the attackers of the Socialist President whose revolutions had not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question a 35-hour working week in France, despite the burning conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland requested his socialist partner to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tober, the Minister of Justice, threw sticks into the wheel by gathering the disagreeing members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among the Socialists, said that it did not represent the new Wall Government for several months.
Frenchman Holland is a naked king, but the naked and prince Manuel Wall, who was forced to assemble a new government when the summer was not over.
"And the new will not take place either in the fall or in the winter," said Mrs. Le Pen to the reporters.
She reiterated her call on the party to dissolve parliament, said she was convinced that the party could easily win in the early elections and was ready to manage.
The ruling party of France survived the collapse of the March municipal elections and the extremely right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
The survey of the resurrected Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of French think that the Socialist Party was at risk of joining several rival factions until the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Cyan Po, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel quickly about something changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The city without drugs is missing.
The Sverdlov Court of Arbitration has left without considering the claims of the Regional Ministry's Management Directorate for Solvency Management to the City without Drugs Fund.
The notification was intended to recover more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a rental fee for a building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlovsk Region has left the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Region (MUGISO) to the City without Drugs fund (one of the founders of the Mayor of Ekaterinburg Evgenijen Roizman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization of 7.3 million rubles as a rental fee for the building.
It was now known that the applicant had not been brought before the court twice and that a decision had been taken to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the IUGISO Directorate was not explained, and the Chief of the Legal Division, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund also failed to contact representatives.
Remember, this is an individual who has been a fund in the centre of the city on Belinski Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was taken by former Governor Alexander Misharrin.
In November 2012, the managing director of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov Region filed a complaint with the Sverdlov Arbitration Court for eviction from the building.
According to the claim, the Office has requested, through the court, that an unencumbered contract be admitted to free of charge by the premises of a memorialist.
In the view of the IUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include any substantial conditions for the rental of cultural heritage.
The Arbitral Court of Sverdlov has rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitral Court of Permy, which was satisfied.
In the same court, the fund then filed a cassational complaint against the decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Fund in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took sides with the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was entered into, under which the rent was rescheduled by the fund, as explained by the head of the city of Evgenien Roizman.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles a month.
The former administration of the area transferred this building to us for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, in respect of the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg's pride deputy, the unicorn Alexander Kosincev, invited the mayor of the city - the spokesperson for the pride of Evgen Roizman.
There was a criminal case involving a retired pensioner, a proud deputy of Oleg Kinev, who was considered a mayor ' s co-worker.
Like Evgen Roizman found a criminal case
On 1 July, a criminal case was brought against the fact that “accused” (art. 128.1 C.E. R.F.) was filed in Mayor Ekaterinburg of Evgen Roizman's blog.
Anna Filatov, the Director General of the Legal Centre for Protection, has been informed of this in the Sverdlovsk area of the Ministry of Legal Affairs.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in her blog of participating in the crimes that she allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
Mary Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is a regular attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone turns into a basketball
Before 9 September, when Apple was due to submit its new development, all new leaks of what could be expected from the presentation appeared in the press.
With reference to sources, the American media reported that the sixth generation of iPhone would be equipped with a mobile basketball function as a result of the joint Apple project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet Resource Re/code, on the presentation of new products on 9 September Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make available the cell phone function in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves reject any comments on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made to the store's cash register using a smartphone.
The payment identification will be carried out by the user using the Touch ID function on his or her fingerprint.
The iPhone will be the first time NFC technology (near field communication) has been installed, which allows for the making of a non-contact payment using a smartphone and the appropriate cash-in-the-box device.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The first NFC function was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was issued by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay off using a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts stress that, despite major investments by high-tech companies in the advancement of NFC technology, American cyclists are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry to the market will still make the riders accelerate and implement this technology more actively in their trading points.
MID France: Paris' position on shipments to Russia Mistralei remains unchanged
The official representative of the MID of France, Roman Nadal, stated Paris' unchanging position on the delivery of Russian helicopters of the Mistral type.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in his interview in Le Monde on 20 August: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," says Mr. Nadala, "RIA News".
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Office responded to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris in the implementation of the contract

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the conclusion of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and secure Prestige Cruises customers, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reporting sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations may still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources were asked to remain anonymous, since the negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships from Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than in the previous year.
It is expected that the $29 billion cruise industry will have a positive impact on the subsequent years on the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India.
Companies strive to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with US regulators for the primary public placement in January 2014.
Apollo became the principal shareholder of the company after the $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tey.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82 per cent of the cruise passenger stream in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises.
Crime TV can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
In Mincom communications Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean State Radio Company in 2014.
As reflected in the draft Minkomsézi decision on a single portal for disclosure of information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidy is intended to be “to cover the cost of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
Money will also come to purchase equipment, roof repair and energy systems in the radio company building, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Activists of Hong Kong's democratic movement interrupted the Chinese representative's statement the following day after the election decision
A group of citizens, loyal to Beijing, stood near China's flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Assembly on Sunday established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the elections of the leader of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of most members of the Committee on the Exposition, which is likely to be a prisoner of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the electoral bulletin and has made democratic movement activists promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial centre from protesting the Occupy Central.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong, in June, democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region and hundreds of thousands went out to the city ' s business centre and set up a sit-down.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Assembly of representatives of Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the Feng Wei State Council also had to make a series of briefings during the day.
Activists stated that they would meet at the Hong Kong Government headquarters in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom has not referred to the democratic administration of Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 ha of the land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to Palestinian autonomy.
As the BBC reports, the decision to join the land South Wifley is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence declared the capture of the territory on Sunday and ordered the military to establish an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, the world public must call on Israel to respond to “the continued settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the state of state of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, the Russian President Vladimir Putin requested on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state” of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the Eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call on the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as was the same as the obvious strategy it should have followed from the start of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed Novorussian territory real independence to get closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with the public first television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return to the territory held by separatists in eastern Donetsk and Lugano areas, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories of Novorussia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace negotiations would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian policies started campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops were attacking peaceful settlements in the regions held by separatists, said ITAR-TASS.
“We need to start substantive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to express the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin ' s words about citizenship were meant in the context of greater autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fear in the Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention by the Kremlin press secretary to correct the "incredulous interpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to treat the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people were Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more difficult battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million non-Russians, and the pre-conflict polls had shown broad support for the wish to remain within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy itself, in fact, by transferring actual control over the territory to Kremlin, which would unite the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, there is a major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his opening speech on 7 June, that after the new elections, Ukrainian legislators weigh amendments to the Constitution to allow the regions to gain greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitements are accused of Moscow.
Putin's latest call to Kiev to deal with separatist leaders, as equals, followed the new attacks of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from before the peace zone along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in a incident that Ukrainian security officials said they were afraid it was the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupola, a stable port of 500000 inhabitants between Novoazov and the narrow passage on the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poršenko called on the European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a more severe draft sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Addis Ababa after two Russian armed forces and 1,000 soldiers had entered the Danube last week to support the difficulties of separatists, Colonel Andri Lysenko, the National Security and Defence Council Press Secretary, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Addis Ababa as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Photo-encompassed scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his aversion to the hackers, who may have stolen photos of his girlfriend Gabi Greco and a complete list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood was upset after a number of exposed photos depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence had been on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible has about 60 exposed photos of the star "Failic Games" Lawrence and a superstar, including the models of Kate Apton and Kara Deleven, Ryanna's singer, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Ivann Strahovski and Melbourne Greco reportedly also had photos stolen as a result of an iCloud escape.
List 101 names of celebrities.
Edelstein, who made Greece's proposal last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private listings and photographs should remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly said to the news site that the hacker attack was “post-hungry” and that those to whom it was directed “feel that they had been invaded”.
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she's in the pool with a cloudy chest.
Palmer's work in the movie includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chack" Introduced and the actress from the "Banny reception" Browning yesterday didn't comment on the stolen photos.
Representative Lawrence said, "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his resentment at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Exposing photos stolen from the mobile phone is actually nothing different from selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, it is impossible to tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
A potential way to steal photos of discovered celebrities has been found
A mass breach of the star accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone annex.
The potential scenario for the development of events described the resource The Next Web.
A Python script has been published on Github that allows you to select passwords for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same is used to access the Apple ID log and password, as is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which famous photos have been stolen.
The script lets you know the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of characters starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that the Find My Phone service had unlimited access to the number of password options.
If the security system is properly organized after a few failures, the incorrect account password should be blocked and the user informed of an attempt to break.
Because of the vulnerability, users did not receive any reports of attempting to improve the password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Hackapp user on Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago on Saturday, and a script program was written to select passwords.
vulnerabilities are now closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, except RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister regularly posted side items
While there is no strong evidence that the use of vulnerabilities in Find My Phone has been used to steal the photographs, the use of this service has already been a cause for concern.
The hackers seized control of the device and demanded redemption from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, Dmitria Medvedev, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, was also attacked earlier.
If the offenders had access to iCloud as described above, there could be a password for the Government's head account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource could not get Apple's comments on the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian Penitentiary
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burrak.
The relevant order has been published on the legal information web site.
At the beginning of this year, the sportsman moved to Russia for permanent residence and requested the Federation of Modern Five to provide her with the opportunity to speak for the RF.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won a silver medal for the European Championship in person and became a world champion in a mixed stage, which is one of the new types of sport.
It also holds leadership positions in the current season.
In accordance with the rules for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need a special authorization from the Ukraine Olympic Committee.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change nationality.
In July Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chessman Ekaterine Lagno, born in Lviv, who is a double champion of Europe (2005, 2008), peace on the brick (2010) and fast chess [14].
The women's team in Ukraine was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the World Cup in Astana (2013) and the European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
CCR terminated the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (CRC) has suspended the criminal case for the accident of the Red Wings aircraft Tu-204.
This is reported by the department's press service.
The decision was made with respect to the death of the commander of the aircraft and of the fighter.
The judicial expert showed that the cause of the disaster was an increase in landing speed, a lack of compliance with standard landing procedures, as well as an unintended exit of engines to increased direct traffic.
Tou-204 Red Wings, following the Prague-Moscow flight, suffered a crash on 29 December 2012 while landing at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft ran off the runway and burned down.
On the scene, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the Bortinger were killed.
Two shippers were delivered to medical facilities where they were subsequently killed by the injuries.
Three other shipowners who were hospitalized with severe bodily injury have been treated for a long time.
In addition, the driver of the car was seriously damaged by the accident at the time of the Kiev Shosse disaster.
There were no passengers on board an aircraft.
After the disaster, the Transport Prosecutor ' s Office carried out a review of Red Wings, which identified numerous violations.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed its work in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelijanenko started training in SISO
A 33-year-old Russian mixed-style fighter named Alexander Emelijanenko, who is in the CISO accused of sexual violence against a domestic worker, has been completely cured of the trauma and has begun training.
That's what the Championship reports.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Emelijanenko with rape.
The suspect was reported to have been searched, and on 9 May he was detained in Tambov after a road accident that resulted in a fracture of his hip.
Emeliaenco was arrested before 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred, and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If the sport's fault is proved, he will be threatened with imprisonment for up to six years.
What power, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelijanenko's career.
In January of this year, Emelijanko took his last team and lost his technical knockout partner, Dmitry Sosnowsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of Fedora Emelijanenko's most famous fighter.
The last is the four-time world champion of mixed martial arts, the four-time champion of peace and the Russian semi-circumvention champion of war samba.
Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The person ' s heart expression is biologically universal to mankind, and every member of his or her body and muscle group is not random, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat that scientists in Australia and the United States have identified.
They reported on their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly read about them in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The anger of a person who is pushed down and down the bridge, stretched into the thin line of his mouth, broken nose, is the same in all cultures, and makes him even blind from the birth of a child who has never seen him, notes the leading author of the Aaron Sell study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with conflicts during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he is able to dictate his condition, and he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have found confirmations and other assumptions: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and turn into examples, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions that are not beneficial to them, and prefer strong methods of conflict resolution to peace.
Apart from the fact that anger is primarily a “emotion of trade”, scientists have concluded that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create a person ' s angry expression should be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer, thus forcing him to agree as soon as possible with his conditions to avoid the conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled the person with or without each of the seven elements of anger on the computer and showed them to the informants.
Although the missing or forward-facing sails did not make a person evil, the more powerful physical participants of the study were unanimously recognized by such human figures.
Human anger, as in animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of its own power, forcing consent and obedience.
A man suffocates his nose and swallows his lips for the same purpose as a baboon that is born, or a baboon that demonstrates his nails.
“The anger “starts” by the interviewer’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately accepts the form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the refusal.
But most striking is that none of the elements of anger is arbitrary, they all express the same," said anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincom communications offered to allocate 250 million rubles to the Crimean Radio Company
