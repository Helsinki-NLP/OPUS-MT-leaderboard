Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was going on.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're out of commission.
Not here.

I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to sleep.
Tom's always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just sent me a text message.
So somewhere in this building.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect this turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to go?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint a lie?
Were you in the U.S. capital, Washington?

Can't you get me up?
I'm not pregnant.
He didn't break up.
I have a question.
That's not enough!
Tom said Mary must still be doing it.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The chief let me go earlier today.
What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
Tonight will be pretty cold.
I'm not gonna ask Tom for help.
How much did you pay to do that?
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.

Now half to the third.
Aren't you glad you're rich?

It's not mine.
What do you want, Tom?
We're almost there.
So you have to be home by 2:30.

Is this Tom's girl?

Are you ready to hear bad news?
I talked to them.
Has Lucy been on the phone yet?
Looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was just going to wash.
Tasty!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
Nobody's listening anymore.
You're brave.
You should do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'm sitting there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.

I have eight brothers and sisters.
Were you busy?
Show it to me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tom won't try to do that.
Starting a fight with Tom wasn't such a good idea.
Tom proved that he had Liverpool in his heart.
I licked the bed.
I kissed Tom yesterday.
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom said it wasn't.
Let's stop this empty discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
No one would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
A pocket thief pulls a passport into Mark's.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll be sorry for you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come tomorrow.
What kind of insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what the sticker looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I didn't sit on that bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary had already done what she was supposed to do.
I've been watching Tom.
You booked a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
It's like going to a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets to the concert until we got the money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play very well in tennis.
I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do this alone at all.
You need So here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People living in the village cannot find satisfaction in living in the village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book on Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a wheel and a potato frie.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your song causes professional singers to be ashamed red.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need that.
Oh, my God!
Tom's drowning.
He was big.
Tom knows what not Mary did.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week, I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try the zippers!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It's unlikely Tom will forget how he does it.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You don't sleep?
The meeting started on the fifth day.
Mary said she likes to do that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary was not busy.
I was in Tokyo only once.
I got the power bill.
What is the color of his glow?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do this.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm happy.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are happy with the decision.
This bottom is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing in the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
I'll find out.
A witness who saw everything in his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who heard it all.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom's done.
When I went into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very nice.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw eggs at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom was wasting his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Tom told you, where's the party going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll have a bite.
I don't want to.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here today.
Tom opened the restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing the old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
Almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me that?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very shy.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to think of a secret language.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
When are you planning on going to Japan?
My kids at school.
I put my suitcase on.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I think about you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant greenhouse.
Sleep salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane flew at nine.
That's pretty free to speak French.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll personally check it out.
That's a dry trigger.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I've had a lot of time.
Let yourself be happy.
She wants to wait for the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't protect herself.
Next month Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's gonna get hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year, millions die of hunger.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
There was an incorrect address on the sheet.
It's the last train.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all chocolate.
They have moved to another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever gonna do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I'm just shaking.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our own fault.
You're so sweet.
It's going to cost about $15.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worth the attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You sang.
I've done everything perfectly.
I like to write.
Kioto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
The following month, I am 16 years old.
Do you think it's likely that this will happen?
Calm down with your dreams.
What time will your last lesson be over?
I'm here to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to get in touch with her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
That's why we need to help.
The rain was gone all day.
I'm sorry about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You need to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes away.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Shut up.
The sun shines on the day, and the night is the moon.
I got on it.
You were right before.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have problems with the boss.
It's banana.
Tom is likely to be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London, I blew up the fog.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom's weak.
I told him to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you'll win.
She went to the airport to take him.
Get away from me.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't get mad.
They won't tell us.
Slow down.
The capital of Brazil is Brazil.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay my phone bill.
Tom can cook.
The music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are the fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
The fun has seven colors.
I don't think that's why we shouldn't do this.
He's cloudy today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his open mind.
Aren't you on a date tonight?
Tom never had to learn a lot.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
There's either you or Jane.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom's gonna be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
Today I was very tired.
I'm real.
Happiness is not to be ruled by many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed off the side of the mountain.
Taxi's here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
It's mine.
How strange!
Can you read the Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is obnoxious, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking idiot.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I'd never be able to do this without your help.
For breakfast, I always have coffee and snacks.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay you later?
Did that just happen?
Mary did not take the umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
In the truth, I told the truth.
I'm sleeping!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can you lend me a pint?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I'm too ashamed.
I got deeper in detail.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
We're going to the ocean.
Do you know what's causing the problem?
Where's Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
Today I have a good appetite.
We're still in our new house.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human folly, and I can't be sure about the first.
She said, "I'm very happy."
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
What you sow, you will reap.
What did you hesitate to do?

I love you.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was a little confused.
He signed the check.
Hey, how are you?
The password is Muiriel.
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Get the trash out of here.
You're my friend.
He's got two cars.
They're aware.
No problem!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can I borrow your knives?
Thank you for your help.
Tom confirmed that no one had been hurt.
He slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
They went to the zoo.
I was shy.
They're poor.
Take my hand, we'll both build up the utopia.
Tom said Mary was confused.
One of them tells the truth.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
You really want to go to Boston alone?
It's hot today.
God gave it, God took it.
From far away to Boston?
I laughed at his joke.
My father may be asleep.
How can you best learn French?

Please take this.
Nobody likes to lose.

This is my wife, Edith.
This student is an American.
A cloud of cheese.
No one's seen us.
I'll wait here.
In her youth, she lived in the suburbs of Tokyo.
Does any of this matter?
It's my e-mail.

The baby's asleep.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's not clear what I should do.
Tom's running the newspaper.
Tell me the truth, please.
We ordered too much food.

In other words, it's linear.

The dog himself is smart.
I can't get the photos out of the camera!
I was impressed to learn that I won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary what she had to do.
All dogs are animals, but that doesn't mean all dogs are dogs.
Those who can think of only one way to write the word are likely to lack imagination.
I'm sure he'll make it.
Tom didn't do it.
Where's the nearest metro station?
Tom escaped through the window.
You're not hiding anything?
How's it going?
I didn't know it was going to happen.
I have a lot of friends.
You can do it right now.
There is no speed limit.
Tom's a little red.
That's what you have to do.
I probably need to spend some time with Tom.

Aren't you a bachelor too?
It's part of the system.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
This bed is for soup.
They went with me to Boston.
Tell me what you want for Christmas.
Give it a ball.

I think you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very thirsty.
You're crazy.
I don't care about Mary anymore.
Just answer it right now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was sorry about the house.
Tom hasn't done this since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
They speak English?
No one's seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would have done.

Tom will never wake up.
That's enough.
I was able to swim.
So you bought a dog?
Looks like everybody's busy.
I can't accept that.
You're so beautiful.
Take it.
Tom's gone.
Tom will be released on Monday.

I can't open the door.
When did it start?
I love fries potatoes.
He's almost always in the hospital.
I just moved in.
Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Thank you for yesterday.

Wouldn't you rather do it with Tom?
Who ran?
I hate my neighbors.
Who can explain this to me?
I'm in love with Tom's friend.
Am I early?
It's got a serious look.
Red's not your color.
I'm not sure Tom will do it or not.
Tom went first.
You're Tom's mad?
Mary lacks a healthy sense of humor.
I'm not going to school Sunday.

You're doctors.
How do you like this town?
I like your coffee.
Tom woke up.
How many in one night?
I'm twice your age.
Mary is like a daughter to me.
It wasn't Tom.
That's right.
You're getting too nervous.
Have you ever seen this logo?
About the same time, Tom was in his room and was studying.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really likes to do it herself.
I know it's easy for you.
Put this sticker in your bag.

You're absolutely right.
The bird and the girl are sitting in the park.
I yelled.
This box is a little heavy.
They're from Sweden.
They sent me to save you.
Tom understands.
Tom's used to it.
Tom's been working all night.
She's not always happy.
I'm sure Tom will do whatever Mary asks.
They're good.
Do you have a subway ticket?
I'm not different from any other mother.
I underestimated the power of the opponent.
What floor are we on?
Tom's getting nervous.
Tom can wait here.
His brother lives in Boston.
I always liked him.
What a wonderful life!
You can do whatever you want.
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Sadly, she already has a permanent lover.
I bought every one of them for a present.
Someone's calling.
When does this end?
Tom was a spy.
I didn't know you had a car.
She's listening to him.
Soup too hot.
He fell to the ground.
You're always late.
Can he come tomorrow?
That's my final offer.

Let's talk about what Tom did first.

What can I do for you?
I like your hair.
Put the book back in the book cabinet.

You don't have to be nervous about these little things.
You son of a bitch.
Is that you?
Please call the doctor!
I'm too busy to go.
Find someone else.
Do you have a professional experience?
Is that the only choice?

I'm sure you'll find a nice job.
You're stupid.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is the hell of another planet.

So I bought a watch.
I didn't say anything.
Don't beat me.
It usually wears a tie.
That person who helped me was Tom.
I'm going outside.
Dog's name is Ken.
I was just right.
When did I tell the truth?
I think Tom's a friend.
We didn't have much time.
I like to draw cards.
He's a joke.
What's the computer?
I'm not illiterate.
Did you sing yourself?
What do you think?
Tom decided to do it.
Your medicine is ready.
I thought you were interested.
Well, everyone, huh?
I was so excited that I could not sleep.
Tom's alive.
I was nervous.
Tom recently changed his job.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner, and she was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there alone.
Do I look nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tom’s house was Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We're all making mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I put too much sugar.
Do you know how to puke?
I know how to do it.
Tom's got it?
I don't need dinner tonight.
I have something to say.
The hotel can accommodate 300 people.
That's why I sucked the pie.
She may ask questions and answer them.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Tom has two girlfriends.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I have a lot of time.
One more, please.
I'm a member of the team.
I had an stroke last year.
My mom's busy preparing dinner.
Horses are useful animals.
Come back soon.
He's incompetent.
Famma was training.
He's impatient.
He's sure it's a test.
Tom voted in favour of the proposal.
Tom told you how long it took him to do this?
Let's start!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the literary song of the Devil.
Sadly, she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom's actually going to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the last weekend with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
That costs too much.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to stop.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We're gonna lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the air sphere is a non - euklidean space, so it does not comply with the rules of euklidean geometry.
Talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I was trying to call you.
I never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice my age.
The journalist was robbed by terrorists.
I dropped the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
Programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and so am I.
How many do you have in the clock house?
Tom's deaf.
So I don't like eating fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
You're very proud of it.
Your doctor says you'll be all right.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My tie is orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
That's why it'd be better to be tall.
I'm supposed to help Mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
It's not my idea.
You have a plan, don't you?
He's playing.
Tom's not in town.
I was wearing shoes.
The next year will be worse.
Mary in the yellow dress.
A bitter taste in love.
The meeting is over.
You had to do this last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I have an old machine.
We understand why.
I eat every year.
I felt helpless.
I like the teacher.
Let's go to the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockey player.
We went to the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
Motherly love is greater than anything else.
He was stalking a thief.
I worked at the restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
Doing this won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat right now.
The mirrors were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a beautiful car!
She went to school.
Tom was sitting next to the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
I don't think I should do that.
State debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
She's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Does he still have a bicycle?
Talk to me briefly.
That's smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anybody who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time online.
You're adorable.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't eat this.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's leaving in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.
We can talk.
The computer can count very quickly.
You don't have to.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the bumpers.
People still using webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
The brother is sick.
Don't worry.
The machine is outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost her money.
There are no rules.
Leila got pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a salad from raw fish?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There's no doubt that it's going to rain.
Tom didn't mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We really went to Boston.
In Iceland, there are many volcanoes.
John's older than me for two years.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little thick.
He answered my questions easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love children.
Who's left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm so glad you did it yesterday.
Is that where you're still living?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a witch.
Don't beat me up when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
Tom would've liked it.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She's been waiting for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years ago.
Tom's probably gonna do this.
It's got to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mom.
After a brief peace, war broke out again.
It's better not to trust that.
Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What's this restaurant called?
I'm sorry, could you hand me some sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" "On the table."
I don't think there'll be any problems.
Tom broke up?
You need to cut yourself.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing soccer.
How does this work?
You're very disgusting.
Hurry up, guys.
I'll fix the shirt.
When is his return expected?
I got a good rest.
He's no less good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He's not afraid of death.
It would be good if there were 28 hours in time, wouldn't it?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He wants this disaster not to happen.
We don't expect victory.
I don't have the money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the boy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to make a phone call.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn how to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They can catch fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom's teaching French.
I tried to get in touch with her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do that.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, like, a workman.
Answer the question!
You need to go to the hospital.
I can't find any leads.
It's a forgery.
That's not what Tom asked Mary to do.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, where Gran Prie was broadcast.
Tom's proud of his daughter.
Don't remember.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do that.
English isn't my language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, it should not be done again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom ran out on Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children while she's gone.
I'm cooking now.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom took his head off?
Why would Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't go with us.
I got thirty points.
If I don't, Tom will be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
The big tree fell on the road, and when I was driving, it paved the way for me.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren't you getting bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I was just trying to do that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new safe.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year that I was, and she's preparing for the exam.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Did you do your homework?
Monday's probably gonna be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help so paint the park.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and on the contrary?
Can you help me?
Dumb.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should call the doctor.
I put the papers on the visa.
Snow is coming today.
She kept working.
The rope broke when we climbed the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you ate less burgers, you would probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Isn't Mary going?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren't you seeing anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What date is it today?
Where's Dad?
Close the door.
I'm not gonna talk to Tom French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Grandpa is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in the gins.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a whale.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do this with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm safe.
Don't you mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
You want to do this, don't you?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom's kicking the dog twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honsu, and Kyusu.
You're probably very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do this right now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Get angry.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you get it?
She committed suicide.
We've got our computer offices.
We need to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren't you planning on staying?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three more books than I do.
You've missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become the object of criticism.
It's going to be brilliant.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under a fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom witnessed Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can you ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom's cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play a script?
Can you pass me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He himself was popular with both students and teachers.
You can't help the mountain with your tears.
Tom's playing soccer and running.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Tom then hung up on the phone.
I'll be back soon.
The church is near the bottom of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do that to you?
I'll have some more coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do this.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him why he did it.
He's talking to the Esperanto with a little French accent.
It's not yours.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't do it.
She's got nice manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady's lover.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a witch?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Let's go.
So you're gonna let it get you?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a child, I was very shy.
Did he really move to Boston?
Tom extended Mary’s beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't gonna be here?
Children grow up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He's back at the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
Language media subconsciously follow the rules of their language, even not being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters aimed their handcuffs toward the elephant.
Nobody cares.
They tried.
Tom and Mary still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary were unable to help me do that.
I'd like to take the money.
I'm holding Tom's hand.
They'll be all right.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
You don't have to worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom was voting?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do that.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the park.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You don't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you put the canyon?
This year, did you get a Christmas present from Tom?
I'm still a little bored around the house, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have memory problems.
Where's Mom?
He woke up three hours after the accident.
You speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Tom's okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know why?
Check your voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom's a little bit off the chart.
Tom's not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi here?
Hurry up because you're late.
It'll be hard.
Does Tom always act like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You're never missing.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's working, you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I was finally given water rights.
I'm not a student.
So Mary was sorry.
I'm just looking at the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on disembarking the boat.
Money won't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed with your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good morning.
Please write your name in pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She's totally ignoring me.
Tonight he's going to play.
I was talking.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know it was going to happen?
What's that?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the exponent can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you shave.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what just happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
Did you say that because I was kidding?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was nice.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's impatience.
Today I have a lot to do.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
They suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get the trash out of here.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister's always great.
This will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How terrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him for work, you should take his youth into account.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
It's his imperative idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom was reluctant to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it's gonna be impossible.
Do you have any major pain?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
By the time Mary got to the bus stop, the last bus had gone.
Tom's in the black suit today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where are you living?
Now they're worthless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt Tom can win.
The Inoplanets fly in and take our work from us, land for the land!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, aren't they?
Is that why Boston still likes it?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Pick up your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I've had a good time.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm better off.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job yet?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not easy to do that.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the butterboards.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
Anyway, I wanted to sell it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
So I called right away.
You looked interested.
It'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We really don't have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to reach his goal.
Kena's got two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love trips.
The phone's not working.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sunglasses.
Tom's drawing well.
All you have to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can you get a suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We don't have money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to get hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Tom actually think someone's listening?
It doesn't seem necessary!
Tom, you can say it's nice.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go before.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's having a good time.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't mean to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
You couldn't open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such an impatient person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's worthless.
I'm very interested in studying French.
It was good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm eating at the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have things tomorrow.
I'm rude.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
Variants are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I'm sleeping bad.
Don't you buy it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did?
Did you do that?

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!
Maybe I was wrong.

That's what Tom finally did.
I'm tired of playing.
Are you French or English?
He's back in the corner.
Just keep doing what you do.
You made three mistakes.
There are no rules, but there are some exceptions.

Tom also speaks French.
Aren't you willing to help us?

I don't understand.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for advice.
You're sick.
What do you need to do?
I never fed my dog with bananas.
I've got an appetite.
Tom says you're healthy.
I don't like any of them.
I shouldn't have made that decision.
She's got a lot of friends here.
Don't you want to pay that much?

I'm hurt.
Our refrigerator's not working.

You want to tell us something?

Who's the cookie?
I'm a locator for them.
I couldn't stop crying.

I fell asleep before Dad came home.
That old cot had only one bed, so we slept on it in a row.
I'm so tired.
They're gone.
I want you to be here.
Tom seems to have no idea how to do this.

Burn the body.
The cat ate the mouse.
Don't work too hard!
He's smart.
You don't have to say that.
Last week Mary and I went to the library together.
Help her!
Tom fixed it.
I feel like I'm going through.
In this case, you're wrong.

Are you busy every day?
Tom said Mary was worried.
You like doing this, don't you?
Every day my brother takes a new book in the library.
I'd like to confirm the weaponry.

Tom's an asshole.
That's what it's like to be angry.
Did you know where Tom lives?
Tom's cute.
Welcome to Tatoeb!
I can't find Tom.
He cheated on my words.
Thank you for yesterday.
He's always so busy.
Neither Tom nor Mary have done so.
Tom and I will always be friends.
You're often not right.
That reminds me of something.
No one's been calling.
Do you have a good relationship with your new classmates?
You had to turn right.
I'm not very good at French.
I have one of them, too.
I'm lucky no one saw me do it.

I'm really proud of you.
We're almost there.
I don't know any of the guys.
That's better than I expected.
I think Tom told me the truth.
I think you know Tom.
Do you have any problems?

I don't have time or money for this.
We can pay.
I think I did it wrong.
I'm looking for a book for kids.
I doubt Tom's coming.
He doesn't care what others say.
Tom caught the ball.
Why is life so difficult?
Some people are very tense.
I don't know how many years ago.
Mary was the only girl at the club.
It's a difficult problem.
Mary's at work, isn't she?
I told him to speak French.
Tom's a teacher, isn't he?
Tom's surprised.
I tried to help you.
I wasn't trying.
Nobody's gonna take me to work.
Don't you want to have kids?
Tea without ice.
Philosophy is not something you can learn for six months.
You want to lose weight?
Tom thought no one was looking.
My father is too busy to go for a walk.
This place should be visited twice.
I'm just going for a walk.
He sells cars.
They were my friends.
I found something very interesting.
I'm not afraid of your dog.
You lived here?
Maybe Tom's tired.
I don't think we can do that.
Tell me why I'm calling.
We'll try.
Tom shared Mary’s pain.
They're sick of playing.
I can't forget her smile.
I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to.
I don't like fish.
I'm not what I think I am.
I feel tired.
I've got food.
Mary asked Tom to let her drive the car.
Tom’s excuses were regrettable.
Warsaw cheaper than London?
I'm ashamed of my bad English.
Are you hungry?
How did you get out of prison?
You can't bring anything.
You're a success.
I have a sea pig.
You have a son of a bitch.
Who were you going to dance with?
Thank you. I jumped all six files.
Tom died of tuberculosis in 2013.
Good job!
My cat is so sweet.
I like cake.
He looks tired.
Look, here comes your train.
This is my watch.
What are you looking for?
Life is beautiful.
It wasn't easy.
You like chocolate milk?
You're a ghost?
You have restored my faith in humanity.
How's your mother?
He doesn't believe in evolution.
I hurt my back.
Where did you work last year?
Your secret will be safe with me.
That would be very proud of you.
He's here personally.
I really want to eat.
Tom died the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.
I think the exams are ruining education.
Very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
Actually, he's never been to New York.
Tom thought Mary and John might be involved in arms trafficking.
I was tough at the time.
Here's your deal.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
Rio de Janeiro was founded in 1565.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
I don't think you can do that.
First of all, you should understand yourself.
I was there yesterday.
I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom can drive.
I read the novels of intent.
I was going to say so, but I forgot.
I'm a hero.
They love us.
I really need your help.
Tom, I betrayed you.
I got up about 6:00.
I don't want to brag, but I'm smart enough.
Does that matter?
Can I have you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if that's why you can trust me.
What happened to her?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he come?
Where's your rat bear?
How's it going, Tom?
Perhaps this year we will finally win the Eurovision.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I tried to forget my wallet.
Cats catch a mouse.
You can go.
Tom said it's not against doing this for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
What wonder would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
You need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this?
Am I clear?
I'm free today.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Despite everything, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
At first, I didn't believe him.
The phone's not working right now.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Get inside.
Tom can punish if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
That's really unreasonable.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's always going against herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog is following me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
Tom's already in French.
The earth passed from father to son.
There are no roses without spikes.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Tonight, wait for a surprise.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He threw away his family.
Shall we go?
I don't need to get in touch with Tom.
I'm hungry.
I'm the boss.
Tom had a good time.
You should be home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent that day with his daughter.
Each student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what they can do to me in court.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
It came out of my hands.
It's good to speak French.
I know I'm gonna learn a lot.
I went out on Monday to catch fish.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look over there, shark!" "This is a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very friendly.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my fault, not Tom.
Congregations have gone pretty well.
At this time of the year, the wind blows from the ocean.
I saw Tom smile.
Let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and kill this huligan.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a triad.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
Do I need to go to the hospital?
She makes dolls in her spare time.
I think Tom's singing country music better than any other one of my acquaintances.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I've got this going well.
Why did he quit?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she's not sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unpredictable idea is that it's a terrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's in Tom's.
Tom was a Bosnian.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to do this.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You should help her.
I'm crying. You don't cry.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to land on that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you'll be back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
I'm ready to work.
What's the theater?
Did you see the protein?
Mary said Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I visited Grandma.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the front door slammed.
I can't follow you.
Maria's doing great dancing.
My grandfather from Osaka.
I want a massage.
Tom's such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get some sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
How do you think Tom's gonna be here?
Will it be snow tonight?
Do you want to have a good time?
Are you meeting someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do something for me?
I ate orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
He's small.
Didn't you know it was going to happen?
Bad thoughts lead to bad acts.
Did you bring a fan?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have any money from this shop?
Tom seems a little shy.
We can't go without water.
I can't get along with my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I'd never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom wasn't wasting his time.
Incite me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom claims to be satisfied.
How do you feel now?
How many in your class of boys?
It's a big apple.
Choose your gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something similar?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
The absence of the news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers will save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm walking slowly.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw my bones away.
Many pages were missing in the book.
I raised the coin.
I'm supposed to go to a meeting.
Tom never violates his promises.
We need to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah aren't getting along very well.
Every student has their own party.
I spent 12 hours.
I'm still sorry about that.
I'm not sure Tom is telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have any tension.
I've learned how to feed cows.
I'm a city.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
She was deeply saddened by the news.
I've had a lot of time.
New Year's!
You'll see it yourself.
I never killed anyone.
What's your name?
She's holding flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
It's over nine.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
You from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're doing well, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I get your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of resting.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything about what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us the truth.
Tom heard Mary got married.
I've learned a lot.
How much does this parasol cost?
They both laughed.
What happened?
That's possible.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class is infected with flu.
Remember when you first heard Beatles?
Did I hurt Tom?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
Word is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this football.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom may still be angry.
I'm going to the airport.
Don't look at her lips.
I'm glad Tom will help us.
Tom's gonna be here for a minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How much time does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her to a meeting.
Are you Japanese?
Tom seems scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom does?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
How is that my fault?
With regard to Switzerland, have you been driving there for winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off his credit debt.
Try to look at it from Tom’s point of view.
The window has been opened.
Nobody thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom had a pretty sick look when I saw him last.
That's still meeting Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me deal with this with you.
Mary watched the romantic comedy.
Grab him!
Someone knocked at Tom's door.
Tom is such a fool.
You want some potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a lipstick.
I have three questions for you.
I met Tom several times.
Do you use a text processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint a red doll?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You don't speak French, do you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took his ring off.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are getting a little old.
