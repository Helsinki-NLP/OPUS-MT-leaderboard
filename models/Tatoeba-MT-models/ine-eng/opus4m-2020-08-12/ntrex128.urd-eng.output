Welsh AMs is concerned about ‘looking like fools’
In some AMs, a suggestion that their speech should be changed to MPSs is being threatened because of
It's created because the name of the assembly is changed to the Welsh parliament.
In the entire political perspective, AMs are concerned that it can make them attractive.
A librarian AM said they're worried that his voice is with Twp and Pwp.
For Karen out of Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means dog.
A field AM said their group has collectively "not happy" and suggested an exchange
A Welsh Conservatory said that his group had a "open mind" about the change of name, but said that MWP had a short language gap between the people of the world.
In this section, the English letter of Welsh letter w is similar to the English letter u of York share
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legal forum to disclose the name, said: Any speech from which the Assembly's members are to make a final decision about what to say to the Iraqis is, of course, the Iraqis themselves.
The Willes government's 2017 act has allowed the Welsh Assembly to change its name
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which the Assembly has shown broad support for saying "Welsh Parliament".
In terms of AMs' speech, the Commission has supported the Arakin or WMPs of the Welsh Parliament, but MWP has been the most supportive in the public consultation process.
AMs is obviously proposing alternative options, but reaching out to the Conciliation Officer Allen Jones may be a painful idea, which is expected to bring together legal issues about changes within weeks.
There are other changes to the way in which the law regulates the assembly, including changes to the design of the AMS and the Committee system.
During the debate, AMs will vote on what they should call.
Macedonia will vote in a referendum to rename the country
On Sunday, the vote will turn the name of your country into "Common East Macedonia"
The neighborhood of public opinion is designed to solve a decades-long struggle with Greece, which is called Macedonia.
Ethins has long insisted that his northern neighbour's name be sued on his letter, and he repeatedly objected to the efforts of the U.O. and Neto.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who opposes the change of name, said they would ignore it.
However, the leaders of the referendum, including the Prime Minister, have argued that the change of name is only the cost of involvement in the EU and the net.
St. Martin’s Hours of Silence When Church Houses in Harlem Face Challenges
Mr. Adams told me that, historically, whenever I spoke to the elderly, they said that there was another church in every corner.
Neither of them today is one of them.
They said, "It's a good idea to be away from the market."
The meeting of the public has become a variety of ways
The bars are no longer sitting in the castles where the people regularly visited.
As far as the church is concerned, they think that the money they sell won't be as long as the prisoners expect, and they'll stand where they went.
He further said that church buildings can replace the houses of the Kandominim, which will be filled with people who will not help the remaining places of worship in the area.
They said, "There will be a great many of those who buy Kunduminum, and they will have a role to play in the imprisonmenting of these churches, because it is unlikely that those who move to Kanduminum will be the residents of the Kanduminum."
These two were built by white pam groups before becoming a black pam metropolis of the church house Harlem, which formed the Metropolitan community in 1870 after a decade of Saint Martin.
The original White Fam Methodist group was copied in the 1930s.
A group of black people who worshipped nearby named the building.
Under the direction of Round John Howard Johnson, a black pampering group took over St. Martin and led the boycott on the 125th Street of Harlam to fill black pampering and resist the growth of black pampering.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when the church council members of Father Johnson planned to build it, they received the service of Kerlyon.
In the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin, Round David Johnson called Kerlyon "Hours of the Poor".
In July, an expert who became Caroline told her something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an impossible change in history."
Tfini, a professor at the University of Mesigogan, said that it was the first Carolion to be performed by a black singer named Dennis A.L., who moved to a large Carolion in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Vader said St. Martin didn't change it.
What has been going on in St. Martin for the past few months is a complex story of architects and builders, some of whom were brought from the Church's general leaders and other scholars.
In July, the Paris Centre for the Administration of the General Prisons showed the priest's concern in writing that the relationship between the architects and the architects who sent the link would be placed on the building, although the building was not involved in filling them.
Some prosecutors complained about the connection.
Sharks injured a 13 - year - old girl in Django for fish in California
Officials reported that Sharkfish attacked a 13-year-old boy on the first day of the week of Lobster Cisen when he was drowning to catch fish in California.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. at Insaniatas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in Diego that he was suffocating with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy running for help, helping him to get out of the water with a group.
Hemme said that before he realized that he was walking happily on the catch of fish, but then he realized that he was going to have something cut me off.
Something's cut me off.
He said that when he went to the boy, he found that his whole bones had been opened.
Hemme said he told everyone to get out of the water and said, "There's a fish in the water."
The boy was taken to the radio lighting hospital with Diego, where his condition is reported to be interesting.
Couldn't find the lashing shark.
Life Guard Captain Larry Wales reported during a media briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was designated that it is not a dangerous shark.
Gales further reported that the boy has been injured in the upper thigh.
The contractors have closed access to the portal from Pontou to Asnetas for research and security purposes.
Gales said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but are not considered more dangerous.
Construction of the British Sensebry project to enter the beautiful market
With the work of the Sansbrück Spillshte Associates, the Department Store is presenting designs of bots, superhero and Debian Hams.
The UK's 2.8 billion-pound property market, which is still growing while the sale of fashion and household equipment is slowing down, will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country as part of a possible entry, and the next year, if successful, will be added to the store.
Construction works in beauty are being done at a time when supermarkets are searching for ways to use the sites of the TV, the micro-vo and the domestic appliances.
Sanzbury said she would double the size of her beautiful proposals by about 3,000 designs, such as Revolon, Tuzermin and Dr. Pai Pai, adding brand names for the first time.
The current offers of El Uril, Fruit Bean and Barts Bez will also provide special places for branding, as is the case in boot shops.
Supermarkets are also relaunching their botanical makeup so that more designs are in line with the will of the green trees - something that young buyers are asking for more
In addition, the smell of the Fairies shop will also test the feed in two Sanzbari stores, one of which will open last week in the Accordion area of South London, while the other will open the Burmese area in the next year.
Buying online online and offering local stores less than a day's price means changing the price of buying daily food, which means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sensbury's Chief Executive Mike Cope said their outlets would look more like departmental stores, while the Supermarket China is competing with more services and non-food products.
Sanzbury also put Oros's outpost letters in its hundreds of stores, and has also introduced several Habitats since he bought two years ago, says that it has increased his fat cell.
The previous effort to reorganize the fields of beauty and beauty of the supermarket had failed.
Sinzbury had tried a joint attempt with bots in the 2000s, but it ended after the debate on how to divide the revenue from the chemist stores into its supermarkets.
This new practical wisdom has come to light at a time when Sinzbury sold his 281-store Formisi at the price of 125 million pounds a year ago to Leids Formisi China's owner Silesio.
He told us that the early maintenance of the four stores would play a role in this project by providing branding, including laurels, and the production of large-scale designs.
Consular Director Paul Mál Hex said: "We have changed the shape and sense of our masterpieces in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have especially invested in training activities that will be able to provide prompt advice.
Our brands are prepared to meet all our needs, and a sense of humor and convenience means that now we've become an interesting place that presents beautiful designs that challenge the old way of buying.
After leaving the 11 million pounds agreement in Holly Walloby, Peter Jones is "hungry"
Dragons Dan's Star Peter Jones T. V. Voloby wants to focus on his new agreements with Wallo Marks and Spencer and ITV after leaving the 11 million pounds deal with his life-style brand.
There's no time for brand-trolling and wearing clothes in their house with Wolby.
This couple's business is compared to the Gyneth Potter's brand.
The 37-year-old president of ten Marning announced that he was out of the store.
Holly Walloby, in the last minute, took advantage of the Star Peter Jones of Dragon Dunn, and said goodbye to the Life Style Brand Business. Voloby wants to focus on his bomb contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
The media said that Jones "became angry" at the time when TV's golden goggles hit Mangal in the Berkhanh Sharer area of Marlo during an extensive meeting in their business empirical headquarters that the price of 1.5 million pounds means that she won't be able to give enough time to set up a brand trolley in Jones' house.
Their business was compared to the Gyneth Pilter's Gup brand, and it was thought that Volby's wealth would be about 11 million pounds.
Just as a 37-year-old Voloby announced leaving the Trolley on the Instagram, Jones immediately went to one of the ship's sailing homes.
A media report: Trolley is the first of Holly's priorities
It is thought to be a long-term future over the next two decades.
Each of them has been completely surprised by the decision to leave it.
What was happening to Mongolia was not convincing anyone. It was close to the middle of the launch.
There's a pile of equipment in Marlo headquarters that's ready to sell.
Experts believe that the president of ten Marning, who is one of Britain's most profitable pro-stars, is likely to lose millions of pounds on clothing and household equipment from the use of waxes and candles, and that there is a possibility of more delays in its launch.
And it could end up with a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Oluby and her husband, Dan Baldon, have been near Stara Cup for ten years.
Voloby set up a troll together in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as a chairman.
Couples had a total of six and 40 percent owned a TV production company in Junees Baldon.
I'm A Celebrity's I'm A Celebrity.
Joe's immediate media said last night that we won't review his business.
and he said: 'We have been given love'
They criticised themselves for commenting on what some consider to be "foreign presidents" and ridiculed the North Korean authorities.
Why has President Trump given so much food?
Thrupe said in a ludicrous voice in his 'News Explorer'.
"I didn't handle anything."
He recalled that at least they had an interest in another meeting with him before the earthquake had made the meeting in June an important step towards the small nuclear weapon in North Korea.
In the case of small arms, jokes are the subject of attack.
After more than three months of meeting with the Chief of Staff in Padapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Young told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "responsive reaction" from the United States of America.
Instead, he said that the U.S. bans are still on to increase pressure.
Thrupe liked his rally talk more.
They said, "We are doing well with North Korea."
We were fighting North Korea
Millions of people would turn out to be pieces.
Now our relationships are strong.
He said that few better relationships have resulted from their positive efforts -- the end of the rocket tests, the help to release the irgumals, and the return of the remains of the US soldiers.
And they defended their unusual way of talking about relationships with little.
"It's so easy to be strong, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people in this whole place, you're looking at about 200 people in front."
In Indonesia, the island was devastated by earthquake, hundreds of lives were destroyed.
As a result of the earthquake in Lumbok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need them.
Although 10 percent of Lumbok's population had lost their homes, the national disaster was not declared, which is the basis for international aid.
Ms. Sombong said that in many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they would not ask for international assistance, which is a bit of an appeal.
While Seo de Lairner is training a team to go to Paulo, he is not sure that his work will be done on an occasional basis.
Mr. Soputo, a translator of the National Agency for Natural Disaster Reduction, said that the Indonesian authorities are investigating whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes, the country is not ready to cope with natural disasters
When shelters from tsunamis are built on arrival, they are only visible on the coast.
The absence of anti-sonymous syringes in Poland is considered likely to be responsible for the killing of the animals.
Even in the best of times, many Indonesians want to be able to travel between islands.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex
There are plans for earthquake treatment in Lumbok to go to the hospital Paulo, but it will take him at least three days to reach the new location of the natural disaster.
President Voddo made the Indonesian-made investment firm's choice to improve, and he has spent money on the streets and on the railways.
But what the management of the fund is faced with is money, while the next elections will be next year.
Despite the growing religious pressure in Indonesia, some of the majority of the Muslims have adopted the more valuable form of religion.
There were more than 1,000 people killed and thousands of people were missing in the riots between the Jesusians and the believers, with the use of spears, guns, arrows, and other handguns.

Strutt picked up a neighbor from the Harden Shakiri from the Chelsea bullet at about 30 yards away when his team was behind zero compared to one.
He moved forward to the left and then shot at the distant post.
And he came to the right side of the towering net from the top of the box.
The song finally crashed into the net on the capa Arsblalaga.
Strung told LiverpoolFC.com that I was trying to get to this position, to get to the song, and the players like sad always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to make a way for myself.
When I saw the ant coming in, I only touched the ant once and shot it with no more thought.
Chelsea got a high score of 0-1 in the haph time from the Blagin Star Edna Hazard in 25 minutes.
Blues Streiker turned the gang near Mod Field and returned to the Mato Kouchak with his footing in the court of Léopold.
Koachak captured the song immediately in Modfield.
He brought the song back beautifully into the box with Hazard.

Police arrested 32-year-olds who suspected the murder of a woman in Chaco
This morning, a woman's body in the Barbon Head of the Mercy Side has been launched after the murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 p.m. on John Street with a grey mouse and a 32-year-old was arrested in a murder case.
The police have told the locals if they see or hear anything, let the police know.
The Chief Inspector Inspector of Crimea and Hagani said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I appeal to those around John Street in the city of Barcquel.
I appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, if they have something to do with the Dash Cam Pattage, contact us because it may contain information that is important for our investigation.
Police have confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local head and the body was found within a spring.
This afternoon's friends who think they know the woman came to this place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing while the police have reported that they are in the process of notifying women's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in a grassy table has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He fainted when he found out about the incident.
The residents are now told that several hours may pass when they are allowed back in.
A police officer has been told that the situation is being imagined to be going to the whole area
A woman came to the scene of a crying incident.
She used to say, ‘This is indeed a grief!’

The most recent memory of the review of the Crimean Wall outside parliament's 'Reset History'.
The destruction of the search for so many cultural and religious philanthropists in her desert England will be natural justice for her geniuses and cutlery of Jesus ’ followers
However, the Kremwell Society called Mr. Kirk's suggestion "unknowable" and "an attempt to restore history".
Kerm Well Society Chairman John Goldsmith said: In the current debate about the removal of the statues, it was unfortunate that the figure of the better Crime Wall would be the figure outside the Palace of Stustminster.
Kremwell did not order the gods of the British household to tear down the warriors, nor did he do so.
Maybe in the past century his father Thomas's actions would have made the wrong crime wave a sacrifice.
Sir William Hamo's excellent representation of the Crimea of the Terni Croat is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of a remarkable character that is thought to be appreciated by many scholars.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sandy Tel Graph: "Many people, perhaps more than in the late 19th century today, think of the external pressure of the Crimean Wall, which they would probably have against the Parliament.
Is this a correct representation of the ongoing historical debate?
One thing that is certain is that the mid-17th century settlement laid the basis for the growth of our country's heritage, and Kremwell is an individual well-known personality that represents a part of this division.
Their actions as Lord Protectors are worthy and worthy of respect.
Killer Dinzier hit and killed Chinese people
According to local media, in a South-West China facility, a rioter attacked the farmers and killed them.
South China Marning Post reported on Sunday that a man who was killed, identified only by his family name "Yevan", was found in a bloodbath in the village of Sobbe Guizz in Lupashwi.
China's province is preparing to place vaccines in a farm on May 30, 2005 in the region of Kangai.
According to reports, he had come with his cousin from the Greek neighborhood of neighboring India to sell 15 sours in Mandi.
The next morning, his master found him dead, and he found that the door of the well was opened.

His body was found an hour later.
He wasn't the killer's son-in-law, Joan.
A market manager told the Young News that the engineer was locked in the lock so that he wouldn't attack others while the police were collecting evidence from the time they left.
According to reports, Greece's family and market officials are mocking the death penalty.
Although this is remarkable, events of the attack on humans have already been recorded by the authorities.
In 2016, a engineer attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and severely injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound-weight engineer killed a whale farmer with a tractor, but he was blown away after his wife.
When a farmer from the Dwarves and the Eggs were bitten in 2012, a mantoba farmer told the CBC news that the Dwarves don't usually like gravity, but the blood vessel can act as a "triger".

He said, ‘You are indeed among the honoured ones.

Over 20 million people have seen the audience of British Kenya
Judge Brett Kenny and women, who allegedly accused them of sexual abuse in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million people on six television television networks on the screen of the Supreme Court.
There is still still political expansion, and the unexpected situation of the last minute of Friday, under which the F.F.F.I.A.'s Secretary of State created a breach in his regular programs to prepare an agreement to investigate charges for a week by F.B.I.
Ms. Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee 100 percent believe that while he was drinking during a high school party, Kenya tried to take him down and take off his clothes.
Kenya said during the emotional testimonial that 100 percent believed it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the audience, according to Nielsen's report.
The company was counting average supervisors on CS, AC, CS, CN, fax news channels, and IM.
There were no data and data for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fax Business Networks, which showed it.
And Nielson has a problem measuring people who see in general offices.
From this point of view, the size of its supervisors was as large as a football match or academia Edward.
Nielson told the fax news channel, whose partners supported the Kenyan speech, was ahead of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million supervisors throughout the day.
A.C. 3.26 million officers were on the other number.
Nielsen reported that 3.1 million CBS, 2.94 CBS, 2.89 CBS, and 2.52 million CNN were seniors.
Even after the hearing, interest continued.
On Friday, there was a flag in the drama.
After a statement of vote from the Office of the Medium-Friendly Republicans on Kenya, on Tuesday morning C.N. and C.S. Chambers closed the film in a condition that the demonstrations were going on as they tried to climb up an elevator for the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
CNN was directly shown that they stood down while they were being severely harassed.
One woman said, "I'm standing in front of you."
Do you think that he speaks the truth to his people?
It is said to him, “You have the authority over many women, and you have the authority over them.”
Flyk said his office had reported and said more before the Elevator was closed he had more to say at the committee meeting
Cable and national networks were publishing the situation directly, when the Judicial Committee had to count on sending the full cent for voting.
But Flick said they would only do so with the argument that F.B.I. will investigate the charges against Kenya next week, which political democracies are also insisting on.
Fly believed after talking to his friend, the Democratic Center, Chris Cos.
After talking to several other senators in Quez and later, Fly made his decision.
The election of the flag was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not need a vote to approve Kenya without research.
President Trump has ordered F.B.I. investigations of charges against Kenya

The rain of Levia on Mexico City from the fire pressure
The popocapitate has reached the southern palaces of the Mexican capital, Leva.
National Centres for Natural Disaster Protection informed the people of Mexico on the week that they would stay away from the fire pressure when it quickly began to move levers and 183 gas and soil were recorded during 24 hours.
The focus is on monitoring the number of attacks and the sounds of the future.
Pictures on social media show a layer of soil on the streets of Mexico City, such as Zuchimelo.
In September 2017, scientists observed an increase in the activity of fire pressure after the 7.1 earthquake in Central Mexico, which is 45 miles (72 km) away from the city government.
The "Don Goo" fire force has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the release of the vote, the police were forced to strike with their own desire.
In Barcelona, six people were arrested after riots during the week between the demonstrations of freedom and the police, and thousands of people participated in demonstrations on the first anniversary of the separation of Catalonia.
A group of separatists who were wearing masks threw eggs and powder paints at the police and covered deep dust clouds in these gullies, which usually cause cracks.
Later, riots began between the demonstrations, and the police loaded a cannon to stop the war.
For several hours, the freedom defenders cried "no forget, no forgiveness" while the United States demonstrations shouted "Spin live".
According to local press, four people were treated for minor injuries.
The first referendum, held on October 1, was seen as illegal by Meadard, while the apartheid preferred Catalans continued to hold sway in the spirit of freedom after a year of joy.
Voters voted for freedom with an overwhelming majority, if the turnout was cut short and the anti-Separate people had more fear.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the polling at the polling stations in the letter during the attacks.
Freedom defense groups stayed overnight to stop a demonstration on the National Police.
The demonstration was held but he was forced to take different paths.
An 68-year-old electrician Nurse Termesus, who was involved in the demonstration of separate favorites with his wife, said she is no longer hopeful about the possibility of obtaining the freedom of Catalonia
Last year we had some better moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when I took part in the ceremony, but now we are trapped.
In December last year's regional elections are important, despite the fact that few margins have won, Catalan freedom groups are faced with difficulties in maintaining the movement this year because many of their famous prisoners have been deported to their homes or managed by a referendum and subsequently declared freedom.
A 42-year-old Mexican youth named Puig, who was recording protests on the phone in support of the police, reported that politicians on both sides have been sued.
He said there's been an increase in enlargement.
After last year, under Harast No. Katalan, one of the prisoners, Uruel Ginquiros announced to the week that they would participate in the elections of the European Parliament next year.
He said that standing up as a hope in European elections is the best way to condemn the abuses of the Spanish government in democracy.
London Derry: Three people are arrested for driving home
In London Darrye, 33, 34 and 39 people were arrested for being beaten several times in a house.
This event occurred at approximately 19:30 a.m. in the Blangard crisis, according to Britain's standard time.
Chief Inspector Babe Biminnich said the gate and the building have been damaged.
There's been a shot at this incident at a time.
Wins from Menga on the Lionstone surrenders from 0-1.
The first shot for Liungston in Dolly Menga won.
The advanced Lionstones surprised the reversings with victory and caused another defeat in the 18 matches of the Stephen Gerard as the manager of the Iberox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike was different, while Gary Holt's team was equal to the other number.
Gerard's team is on the ground without any winnings in the premier shop, and next Sunday it will be against Harts, which is behind eight points.
Before that, the Rings will play games against Repad Viana in the U.S. League.
Porter Atenai, Leungston has taken his losses to six games, and the Head Street Holt has not been defeated since Kenya Mlar was replaced last month.
There are few chances against guests in Lungston's estate.
The Holt team should have made a lot of progress before they scored, while their team had to deal with all kinds of problems.
Scott Robson shook the bridge, but he was able to take his attempt to the front of the missile, and then Ellen Lethgrew expanded himself more than the Air Force had to face the Air Force.
Host team returns were pleased to allow them to play with, knowing that they could make it difficult for visitors to sit in seats
And that's how it came to be in the most important sphere.
Ringers prepared a free cake, and Lionstone started when Decalan and Gallagher met Menga, who scored in the middle of the box.
So far, the hostages' position was stable, but they found that the host team's defense was insurmountable and that the bullet cap is still valid.
This is the same pattern that Peter continued in the other courtyard, if Alfredo Morlos got a seed from Kelly.
Scott Patmin was missing from the surrenders' shot by Allen MacGreeger and lettgrew shot away from another seat in Lungston.
In Léongston's house, there were only two claims that had been made, when Halkitt faced Glin Mudleton and a handball that had been rejected.
Review by Leungston 's 'Unusual'
Alass der Lomont, BC Scotland, in Tony Macaroni Arena
An extraordinary operation and result for Lungston.
For one person, they were great, who showed more perseverance than ever in the journey.
After returning to their flight, the style and team's brains have changed slightly, but the real reward goes to the hotel, which has strengthened the team after its arrival.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkitt was forced to defend himself, which was beautifully managed, while Menga was the coor Goldson and who held the game on the fifth.
But he wasn't jealous in Rings.
The good they're running under Gerard's leadership for a long time, they couldn't meet these standards.
Their song was not controlled and could only start against the guests once -- and it's a dangerous hour for the hostages while they're in the middle of the score table.
Welcome to the campfire in Cologne
On the day of the week (September 29th), the sky was smiling and blue when Turkish and German leaders met at waste.
It was the last day of the German presidential campaign - the aim of which was to establish links between net associations.
They differed between human rights, freedom of the press and the involvement of Turkey in the EU.
After the camps, a great new mosque was built.
Most of the residents in this town have come after Turkey
The police referred security to prevent the 25,000 troops from meeting in front of the mosque, but several Hami gathered close to see their president.
Hundreds of camp protests -- most of them -- were also condemned by the German government, both together with the camp police, and against them, in order to make good progress in the country.
These manifestations reflect this fact. Some Germans praise campers as heroes, while others consider them a real-life elephant ruler.

The road is closed and the bus's face is turned and people are advised not to turn to the area
Long Larton Prison: Six Officers Injured in Hong Kong · Global Voices
Six prison officials have been injured in a man's high-security prison because of a lack of security.
According to Britain's weather, the worst Sunday was presented in HMP Long Larton at approximately 09:30.
The capital, which has eight prisoners, has been called "Tornado" officials to take control of them. They have been separated into a wave.
Officials have been treated for minor injuries on their faces
One of the translators of the Perzen Service said: The prison has been specially trained to continue the incident in HMP Long Larton.
Six of those who have done evil deeds have been wounded,
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that those in charge will be sent to the police and increased in prison.
Some of the most dangerous criminals in the country have been imprisoned in HMP Long Larton, including more than 500.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison was injured in the attack of a prisoner who was treated in the hospital.
And in October last year, police were asked to deal with a severe wave of violence, which was attacked by Paul Balz.
Funks, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, sea storms can be dangerous (may benefit areas affected by drought)
It's fascinating to influence the desire of a Hari Darla, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the ocean storm will hit the rest of the energy desert in the south-west and threaten the willows.
The National Weather Service has already launched a series of railways for East and South-East Nevada, Gjon East California and Utah including Phonx, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
On Monday afternoon, after the rain comes, Mongols expect to take a straight path to Phonx.
In Phonx, the National Weather Service tweeted that "After 1950, only ten cyclons (surrounded) have maintained the Hari storm or thunderstorm within 200 miles of Phonx!
Kostosta (1967) was a sea storm within 40 miles of the AZID border."
The most recent of the national maritime storms predicts the 2 to 4 inch rain of the latest models, while in the Mogulon region of Arsona, there may be up to 6 inches of rain in 10 locations.
The possibility of raining between 1 and 2 inches in other parts of the south-west, including the Central Rakis and the Great Beason, can be combined with a total of 4 inches in the tenth place.
Areas that are beyond the risk of shale rains, the rain of fasting will be shown to have mercy because it is a dry season hunt
Although the flood is a serious danger, some rains are likely to be useful because the southwestern area has been dry for a year.
According to the U.S. Dry Annual Monitor, Arsona's over 40 per cent of the area has been hunted for a very dry year that comes in the second highest range, reports weather.com.
First, the road to the day will pass through the California border of Mexico
Dayday, which was maintained with more than 85 miles per hour wind on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Panta Egonia and is rising from 12 miles per hour to the north.
The storm is facing cold waters in the ocean and is therefore diminishing its power.
So, it's expected that Monday afternoon or evening this will be covered by the Hari Flood force in Mexico
In some parts of Mexico, rain can be severe and the flood can be dangerous.
According to weather.com, there are expected to be 3 to 6 inches of rain in total from the coast of California to the north-west of Sonorra, and there is also the possibility of up to 10 inches.
Day after day, as a harritant storm, it will pave the way to the east of Mexico, and on Monday morning, it will reach the border of wantonia, and it will reach the south side of Mongolia, with a desire to do so.
National Maritime Storm Centres reported that food and its remains would be extremely hazardous to California, North West Sonera and the South West American desert.
These rains can cause mud to fall in the deserts and in the mountainous regions of the country.
Madsomer Newton Attack: Four People Arrested for Trying to Kill
Three young men and a 20-year-old were arrested at the meeting of a 16-year-old boy with injuries to his uncles.
According to British time, about 04:00 a.m., a young child was injured in the Excise Terrace area of Madsomer Newton.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is referred to as "solid".
Ion and Sommerset Police reported that a 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old were arrested at night from the Redstack area.
Officials have appealed to people to show up if they have a mobile phone photo of the event.
The earthquake said Kenya's "fighting, anger" of the Democratic Party.
Thrupe told a rally in the Heiling District of West Virginia that a vote for a judge in Kenya means a vote to ban the unreal and shameful actions of the Democratic Party.
Thrupe accused Kenya of having suffered the "poor and anger" of the Democratic Party in its marriage.
Kenya witnessed the atrocities in the face of the Congolese and exacerbated the strong and emotional nature of the accusations made by Christine Blossy Ford.Kristine alleged that Kenya sexually abused them several decades ago when they were underage.
Ford also testified against his accusations during the hearing.
The president claimed the week that "the Americans showed the goodness and courage of Kenya on that day."
He told a group of hammocks in West Virginia that a vote to confirm the Kenyan judge would be a vote with a record of the most remarkable legal personality of our time and public service.
In the mid-term elections, the President referred to the significance of the Republican Turnout as a sign of Kenya's bankruptcy.
He said that one of the most important choices in our life is just five weeks away.
I'm not taking part in it, but I'm actually taking part in it.
That's why I'm going everywhere for the big hopeful.
Thrupe argued that the democracies are engaged in the mission of "resistance and prevention".
A senior assistant of the GOP leadership told C Ann that the first important opinion in the Senate on the abortion of Kenya would be before the census.
In Indonesia, earthquakes have increased hundreds of people from somnolium to death.
When at least 384 people went through the waves in a severe earthquake and tsunami on the island of Silvia in Indonesia and spoke from the sky, the authorities reported on the week.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast for a mile in the city of Palo when waves of high tides flowed from the coast to the west, bringing people and things on their way.
Sunami was born after the earthquake of 7.5.
Sotopo Provo Nogarho, a translator of the BNPB Agency for Natural Disasters in Indonesia, told a briefing in Jakarta that when there was a danger of Samami last day, people were still busy on the coast, they didn't run away immediately and became prey for the whales.
Nagaruho said that Sonami took everything to cars, trees, houses and land with him. He added that before crossing the coast, the waves of Sonami passed through the sea at a speed of 800 kilometres per hour (497 miles per hour).
He said some people went up the trees to escape the tsunami, and so did they.
About 16,700 people have been transferred to relief camps in Paulo
Buildings and shops can be destroyed, collapsed, and buried in water by the Agency's extensive images.
The coastal city is also experiencing an earthquake every week.
2.4 million people are affected in the area of the population of Tlyzé.
The Indonesian Agency for Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy war on Hiroshima was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima on Friday.
He said, "Maybe the city's geography, which is taking place on a long and narrow hill, has increased the size of the Sunami.
Nograruho called the damage "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping property and hotel land have been planted.
He reported that some bodies have been damaged by the cracks of buildings and said that 540 people are injured and 29 people are injured.
He said that in the north of Palo, 300 kilometres (190 km) of the coast, which is called Dongala and near the center of the earthquake, there may be more destruction and damage
Nagruho said the Twitter system is completely destroyed and there is no news from Dongala.
Red Cross reported that more than 300,000 people live there, and further reported that his work and volunteers are moving to the affected area.
He said it's an alkali, and it could get stronger.
The agency was severely criticized on the week because it was not reported in Palo, although the pledges indicated that the waves had arrived within the time of their arrest.
A person standing at the top of a building in a non-profit photo shared on social media is strongly warning people of the coming down the street of Sonami
Within minutes a wall of water ran off the shore and took the buildings and cars with it.
Writers couldn't immediately confirm the photo.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive surge in electricity, causing a disturbance in the system around Paulo, and making it difficult for governments to engage in aid activities.
The army has begun to send relief supplies to craft ships from airports and other cities, but the impactors still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for aid activities and will be closed until October for other flights
President Joko will be visiting the relief centres in Paulo on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia has risen to over 800
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision is safe to operate, he has arrived in the city of Paulo, where his country is home to a place of refuge from Tarpolin, located in the court of his office.
He said that many homes were destroyed on the road.
The situation is very bad.
While relief workers have begun to work hard to transfer funds for relief operations, some have complained that highly experienced foreign relief workers are being prevented from travelling to Paulo.
According to Indonesian law, funding, equipment and operation from abroad can only begin if the location of the natural disaster is identified as a national disaster zone
Not yet.
One of the translators of the Indonesian Red Cross, Olya Arnie, said it is still a disaster on the plain.
Once the government says it's okay this is a national disaster, we need international assistance, but it hasn't been given yet.
After the earthquake and tsunami that broke out in Palo the other night, friends and relatives of the missing people prayed to God to be among the miracle survivors of their loved ones in the natural disaster.
A child was taken out of the Nile for a week.
On Sunday, relief workers took a woman out after being depressed for two days while her mother's body was near her.
Two missing paragliders were trained for Asian Games by the National Paragliding Team of Indonesia, which ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mandagi, who was arrested at Roa Roa Hotel, told others that they were looking for him.
He told me that as a senator in the paragliding area, I had my emotions.
Mr. Gandon told us how in the hours of the spread of the news of Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, they sent messages to the players who were involved in Paulo's coastal mile.
One of their messages was marked with brown instead of blue.
He said it meant their messages didn't go down.
Stealers paid $26,750 during the A.T.M. R.F.
According to a report by the Newport Armed Police, the thief was taken to Newport in the morning by an A.T.M.R. to charge $26,750 from the Bronx workers.
Sergei Dens Mac Carthi wrote in Relys that the car driver was preparing to release ATI and spend more money on the fun complex.
While he was busy in his work, a man took a bag from the 'Bronx behind the job' and took the bag for Delaware.
The Witnesses had seen a number of people running away from the scene, but the police didn't tell the number of victims in the event.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
River West: Ripper changed its name and set it (Ye)
Ripper Rivers West is changing your name.
Advertised a week of change on Twitter, he wrote: "I'm officially known as the River West."
Acthalia's year-old West has been around for some time and they have used it as their eighth album title, released in June.
This change has been preceded by a participation in the Security De Nait Leo, where they are expected to launch their new albums.
They're taking over Arana Grand in Shaw, who destroyed their company for "emotional reasons," said the owner of the show.
With their current name hidden, West said earlier that the new word is religious for them.
I understand that the most common word used in the Bible is 'yes' and in the Bible it means 'you'.' That's what West thought about changing his album with the radio host bug.
So I'm you, I'm us and it's us.
It came from a well that only means one more now it's been Ye-- which is our goodness, our pride, our concern and everything.
The album also reflects who we are.
They're one of the few famous references that have changed their names.
San Combez is known for various names such as PD, PD, or DD, but this year he took the names and expressed his preference for Brother Lou's.
A former West participant, JAY-Z, has also used hyphen and capital letters without their names.
Determined not to use the army against the citizens of AMLO in Mexico
Mexico's elected president, Andris Manuel Lopez Obrador, has expressed his determination never to use the military against the citizens, while the country's 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against the fugitives is on the move.
Lopez promised to never use the army against the people of Mexico at the Tutalok Plaza on a week.
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers had killed at least 300 people by firing fires on a peaceful demonstration in Plaza, at a time when left-wing movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help young people by providing monthly grants and more free government universities.
He said, "The lack of journalism and educational opportunities attracts young people to criminal groups.
America needs to double the funding for AI
While China is becoming more active in the field of creative intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field.
These comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made EI declarations, although the U.S. government generally has no EI wisdom.
Porter Atenai, China announced its plan last year. He wants to be number 1 in the Ay Jatt favour by 2030.
Lee said, "A.I.D.'s double research budget would be a good start, while all the other countries are far behind the United States, and we're waiting for the next big poll in A.I.
Lee told C.N.C. in an interview this week that double funding would double the odds that A.I. is the next major success in the United States.
Le, published this month by Houton Miflan Harkourt, Sinevation Ventures C.E., one of China's most important AI companies, has been involved in ++Face.
In the 1980s, he worked on the A.I.S. system, which undermined the U.S.'s highest-ranking Othelo-Pierre. Later, he is president of an executive and Chinese branch of Google in Microsoft Research.
Le praised the challenge of the agency's robot design and asked when the next challenge would be to identify future generations of future generations.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government guards.
Lee said, "It's not China, it's the Corporates who're taking the Thadrasian prisoners.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have received expert services from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes can also help the United States to boost its EI efforts
He said I.D.'s got to offer Green Card automatically.
The Royal Council of China continued its development plan for its next generation in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation in China provides funding to educational institutions in the same way that national science foundations and other government agencies would pay US researchers, but there is little educational standard in China.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Armed Forces set up a joint creative centre to involve participants in industrial and educational activities, and White House has announced the position of the Celtic Committee on Design.
And this year, DARPA announced an advance that is said to be an EI Costat for $2 billion.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it now spends over 100 million dollars a year on AI research.
The U.S. National Security Commission's position on design intelligence has not done anything for several months about the development of American law.
Macedonians took part in the referendum on the change of name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be called "the Northern Macedonia", which is a measure that will resolve the old years with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's independence in the European Union and the Net.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name reveals the claim on its letter and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into the net and the U.S.
Both governments made an agreement based on the new name of Majuza in June, but the people's opponents have reason to believe that the change of name will damage the racial identity of the majority population in Macedonia.
President George Avunoff said they would not vote in the referendum and the boycott's campaign has raised doubts as to whether at least 50 percent of the turnout would be completed for the referendum to be held.
The text on the referendum ballot was, "Do you accept the agreement with Greece and Neto and the U.S.
The President-in-Office of the Security Council, including Raif, believes that it is the price of entry into the state of Macedonia, such as EO and Neto, which is a country that has been moving since the end of Yugoslavia.
In Skopje, 79-year-old Olivira Georgesca said that I came to vote for the future of the country today, for young people in Macedonia to live with freedom under the roof of the European Union, because that means more secure lives for all of us.
Although not legally necessary, many members of parliament have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
A two-thirds majority in parliament will be required to rename.
The Russian Election Commission said there were no reports of bad guys up to 1.
However, Turnout is only 16 percent, while it was 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
A 62-year-old Goose Tanowski in Skopje said that I came to vote for my children and for my place in Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Fortan Zaif, his wife Forika and son Dashko are voting on a referendum to change the name of the country in the city of Stromika on 30 September 2018, which will facilitate the path of Samolith in Netto and the European Union for Macedonia
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Ledmer Cavadorcoff was preparing a small stage for the bidders and drawing chairs in front of the camps.
Cavadorcoff said we're on Netou and A.O., but we want to get up and join them, not through the service door.
We're not a poor country, we're our place.
If they don't want us to be included as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Yuro-Asheia poll.
Prime Minister Zaif says that Netu's holding will make the most important assets in Macedonia. The country's unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
After casting his vote, Zeif said, "I believe that the majority of the mass will be responsible for it because our 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the U.O. and net.
He said, "Yes," and he said, "We'll confirm our future."
On Saturday, a survey by the Tut Bray Police Research Institute in Macedonia said that 30 to 43 percent would participate in a vote referendum, which is very low than the turnout.
Another poll conducted by Tulma TV in Macedonia said that 57 percent of respondents want to vote on Sunday
70 percent of them voted in 'yes'.
To make the referendum successful, the turnout must have a vote of over 50 percent.
The failure in the referendum would have been a great shock to the Western government's policy that maintained power in May last year.
Note: The entire British defenses to shoot Sergeo Aguiro from Manchester City
In the UK city of Manchester, Sergeu Aguiro and Rahim Sterling took over the British defence at the United Stadium on Sunday at Manchester City 0-2.
Agioru showed his score in 65 minutes in a funny way.
Argentina's Streicher launched a visit to Medfield at the beginning of the program.
Before he got into the open field, he left three British defenders behind.
Agioru then saw himself in four green scarves.
He slammed one defender and left several others behind at the head of the British box.
Then he turned to the left, looking up.
English Ford saw a song in the box with the first Latvian song back to Aguiro, who used his fingers to hit the British Capper Matthew River and threw it to the right of the song net.
The State's manager, Pop Guardiola, told reporters that Agioro has some problems in his feet
We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky he took a bullet at the time.
But it was a starling that gave the first victory to the Squay Bees against the Prime Minister's League.
He was shot in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguiro was found singing in the area of Brittany.
They sent Larive to the left in a beautiful way.
Sin saw the song starling on the next post with some obstacles.
The Fored of the Scay Balouse hit the net with a slight impact.
On Monday, 12:55 from the German city of resident-Nikir-Irina, the champion league group will be with Hophenheim.
He wants to play a player against the Rakis.
There was no great reason for another one to start after the Nationals' plane of the match.
But the ever-increasing honorary Sunday wants to play against Colorado Rakis, but only if Rakis is part of a flat-off game, which in the National League West has a top game on L.A.D.
Rakis won at least one wild card on Tuesday night with a win of 2-5 on Nationals, but they are still looking forward to getting their first DJ title
Although we're not playing for anything, at least we're going to be able to fight knowing that there's a lot of fun here in Dinor and another team playing on the highest level.
Why shouldn't I fight it?
Nationals have to announce their starter for the week, but according to reports, they'll be able to burn the rate in such a situation.
The participants who will start their 34th session threw the rally at the BP session, and it is expected that they will play on Sunday according to their custom.
Wright Henderer, associated with Washington, U.S.A., is on 7-18 in 220 2/3 inches and 300 strokes.

The president referred the situation to British Kenya, the president of his Supreme Court, referring to the Republican Turnout in the mid-term elections.
All that We have done is in the grave.
One of the most important elections in our time is from five weeks away.
He said, "That's a great thing. I'm not standing in it, but I'm really a partner, and that's why I'm fighting for the great hopeful everywhere.
Thrup continued, "You're looking at this horrible, awfully hot group of democracies, you're looking at it happening.
And he's eager to take power from any means, you see their lack, their wickedness.
They don't think they're hurting anyone, and who's crying to get power and control, they just need power and control, and we're not gonna give them both these things.
He said the Democrats are on the mission of 'defence and prevention'.
They called the Democrats "angrily, lying, and hostile" and they said, "And you've seen this in the past four days."
He referred to the name of Dean Fynstein, the Democratic Center of the St. Justice, as a result of which there were voices from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you write the documents?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no. She was really a good-body language -- the worst-body language I've ever seen.
Libre's not home anymore.
It spares not the breasts of those who speak;
It was not surprising when the believers in my local party considered me to be an insult.
Finally, I'm the most recent addition in the Liberian Parliament, which is said to be disagreeable -- that's why we're talking about the heart.
My parishioners had to face a similar attitude because they stood up against Jewish hatred.
As far as I'm concerned, the insulting movement made me object to the incompatibility with Jeremy Korbun.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national peace, Europe, things like that that Jeremy doesn't match with former prisoners.
Notebook for the meeting of the Nethaneham East Libre said, "We want to make the meetings fun and fun."
As a local Liberian MP, most of my eight-year-olds had a similar meeting on Friday night.
Regrettably today, many meetings have not yet been held and the promise of "Mercy and Mildness" policy has been forgotten for a long time, of course, if ever started.
It is becoming very clear that the opposition is not being tolerated in the Liberian party and that every opinion is based on whether the party is eligible for leadership.
It was soon after Jeremy became the leader, because with me, those who once thought that they were looking at political issues like me began to expect me to take a train and take a position that I would never fit in with again -- whether it was national peace or an e-Gold market.
When I talk to the public -- whatever I say -- social media is having a lot of stress and criticism, and the demands for re-engagement are starting, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the cyber party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm happier than some of my friends because comments about me are political.
I'm surprised to see the leadership and determination of those partners who endure abuse every day on the basis of sexual and racial discrimination, but do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this far-reaching policy is how the levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corebin claimed last week that the Liberian party should promote the tradition of endurance.
It is true that we are no longer living in that spacious church house, and the party is becoming more narrower by changing the movement of any untrustworthy confidence or choice.
In the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice to keep my head down, not so clear, and then I'll be okay.
But I didn't come to do that in politics.
Since I became a student of a school 32 years ago, I've been involved in cybercrime because of the closeness of my Comprehensive School, and I've tried better public service for those who need it the most -- whether as a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the past.
No one in the Nathanheim East has ever been caught up with the situation of my policy and the current leadership on unfair coincidence.
I'm just going to say about the people who have moved the crowd, that when there's a village near the country's tourist that will harm our families, businesses and our public service, I don't want to waste time and energy with the lead of the Liberian party.
But only a message that I would like to give not only to the non-believers but to those who are interested in me, whether I am a liberator or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount or political will will prevent me from acting in the way I think you are in the best interests of all.
Chris Lisley is the retaining parliament for the Nethaneham East.
IR 17 - 38 Monday: Unbeatable IR on the summit
Two recent efforts could have resulted in some high-end goals, but there is no doubt that Ireland had the privilege of winning the amazing and fun of this premium shop.
They are now the top of the table and are the only team of ten that have not been defeated.
Finally, because of their excellent defenses and the better ability to take chances, they succeeded and little Peter Mocha was fully entitled to be pleased.
They said, “We have been tested in our play, and we are undefeated, so I will be pleased.”
Last day's Robin Christie said: "Air is credited, they've taken better chances against us.
Garth Anderson's 14th-minute effort, which Fresier Clemvo turned into a score, made Irish superior, but Captain Rory Hough of Scotland was given the opportunity to increase the number on Wednesday when he received an Ilo card and Mr. Beght made an effort.
Clymo was able to strengthen the high quality of Irish with a panel in the Hof time, and they scored and changed the single effort to score 5-17.
But on Monday, the second haf got started well and Patrick Anderson's effort, which Begt changed,
Because of the serious injury to Rodho Nat, the match was delayed and the IR moved forward on the start of the game when the attempt of Stafford Mac Doll changed.
Then Ier's deputy captain Biley MacFerson was shown a yolo card and again on Wednesday he took advantage of the presence of an additional player and Bruce Colouin tried to change it.
The host team returned to the game, but when the stereo Hachson was shown the hilo card when the song's clime was played without it, Makfarson put the song on the net on the rising air attack.
Clemmo scored as he did when he started again. Kale Roe previously collected David Armstrack's box of cake and tried the fifth of the hostess.
New careers in the Star Restaurant Industry of Steel Game
Steel Game Star Ford is ready to move to the host factory and is found to be part of a licensed restaurant company's directors.
The 56-year-old star named BBC plays the role of Jack Georges, who wrote and presented along with his long-term friend Greg Simphyl.
Both have announced that the next nine will be the last of the journey, and it appears that after Craig Lang, Karen is planning to leave forever.
According to the official record listing, they are the Directors of Agrygmorn Limited
The official has refused to comment on the news, even though the Scatash Sun media has said that Karnan's 'higher restaurant' is in the business.
'The sea is ours': the Bolivian Hague Court expects us to reopen the way to the sea
In Lapaz, the sailors are surrounded by seaheads.
The blue sky is floating on government buildings.
From the Tetaka Sea to the Amazon Seabed, it says: "We have the right to the sea
"It's our duty to take it back."
Dry houses in entire Bolivia are still fresh in memory of the loss of the coastal seas in a bloodbath in 19th century - and the desire to travel to the sea.
Now these desires are now on its highest level in a number of dunes, while Bolivia waits for October 1st after five years of operation of the International Court of Justice ruling
A Bolivian explorer, Roberto Calzadila, said that Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity and greed and expects results with a positive outlook.
Many of Bolivia's citizens will see ICJ's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that in The Hague, Tribbonel will decide on Bolivia's claim that Bolivia is responsible for making a self-restraint trip to the sea after several decades of trivial jokes.
President Evo Moralis, who has a masculine personality in Bolivia, has also had to take a long time for the decision on Monday.
He expressed his determination in August that his country was very close to returning to the Mediterranean
But some analysts think it's not possible that the court will judge Bolivia -- and if it does, it won't change much.
There is no way to refer them to the United Nations tribunal in the Netherlands, and he has decided that he will not determine the outcome of possible jokes.
In international law, a Chilean expert named Paz Zarati said, "The fact that the ICJ's decision is being made only six months after the last trial is heard shows what was 'not mixed'.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may have been damaged in the past four years.
Zarati said that Bolivia's current administration has shaken the problem of access to the sea.
He said that Murali's controversial statement has also eliminated the remainder of the story.
Bolivia and Bolivia can keep talking for a while, but then it'll be very difficult to play.
The two countries have not changed the safari since 1962.
Former President Edwardo Roderveys Ultze, who is the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the judicial process was extremely rapid.
He said that on Saturday, it is an extraordinary opportunity to start a new distance of relations with Bolivia and to end 139 years of unrivalled coincidence for each other.
Kalzdila refused to believe that Moralis, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime problem as political support.
He further said that Bolivia will never be able to afford access to the airport
The court's decision is an opportunity to ignore the need to forget the past
North Korea: Few nuclear weapons can't be accepted without confidence in the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Young, says his country will never be able to handle nuclear weapons when he doesn't trust Washington.
Talking to the United Nations General Assembly on Rey Week
He asked the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the meeting between the leaders of the two countries.
Their effects are evident at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompiou, a young man from North Korea, will resume his search for nuclear fuel three months after meeting with him.
Rey said it's a misconception that the U.S. opposition to the declaration to end the war in Korea will force North Korea to fall.
Washington Pong Yang is careful not to mention any measures that might be referred to as minor weapons without announcing them.
Less and less U.S. President Donald Trump wants to meet with two other leaders.
But the widespread question is that Pung Yang is serious about reducing weapons he considers to be the only guarantee of his peace.
The Pompeii want to tour Pong Yang next month to prepare for the second summit between the small and the tromp
Showcases of big-size hats in Paris Fashion.
Don't wait any longer if you want to increase the capture of your hats or if you want to block the sun completely.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie have shown large-size clothing on their SS19 collection at the edge of the river, which has granted the style set in the Paris Fashion Week.
In the summer, there were strange kinds of hits on the installation, and these designers have sent their great work to Katwak.
Valentine's most prominent silver bee hat was decorated with large edges, such as high seed hats, which covered the tops of the models.
In other large sizes, they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas also revealed the choice of strange masks -- which is being presented on the occasion of the In Halloons.
Many of the colored masks were wearing masks, and they were looking at Hannibal Reader instead of modern fashion.
One of them was like Scooba Dying Gear with Googles and Sanorel, while another hot ice cream looked like.
And if you continue to explain the fashion -- you're lucky
It's predicted that a large number of bonnets will be the beauty of nearby markets.
Big size hats from the "La Bombay" quakes came at the scene, which were two feet wide and were seen on each of the heads from Rihana and Imali Ratakowski.
After this extremely unfathomable hat, a group label spread over the entire social media has brought another big hit to the Katwak - a beach bag made of sticks that is almost as big as your suit is wearing it.
In the Paris Fashion Week, the pink ruffia bag, which was lit by James La Rivera SS19, was the most prominent hand of the Raffia Frans and the top of the white leader.
Celebrate Stylist Lake Armtage told FEMAIL: I expect large-scale hats and coastalbags to arrive in large markets for the next winter, because the designer has left such an impact that it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale discounts.
John Edward: Language skills needed for the world’s citizens
The Scottish Free School Education Society's record has been maintained, and this record has continued with excellent trial results in 2018, which has been strengthened by individual and collective success in the efforts of the players, fans, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 requests in Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), tries to provide the best level of service for applicants and parents.
The free school prepares its students for their next and highest education, their chosen careers, and their place as world citizens.
As a field of education that prepares and implements a better school's outcome, we see modern languages in schools as a favorite and favorite article
Nielson Mandilla said: If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, they're in his head.
If you speak to someone in your own language, that person will fall into the heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's recent trial, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest rate of language in free schools.
A total of 68% of foreign-language students earned a high grade.
Data collected from 74 Irish schools in SCIS shows that 72 per cent of the applicants received Hiergrad in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German readers, 69 per cent French readers and 63 per cent Spanish readers also received Hiergrad.
It shows that free schools in Scotland support important skills such as foreign languages that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
As a result of free schools and in other places, the language of the article now has the same status as STEM articles (Science, Technology Engineering and Science).
A 2014 survey by the U.S. Commission on Journalism and Skills revealed that 17 percent of the reasons for the difficulties in filling seats have been reduced in language skills.
So young people are becoming more vulnerable to language skills in preparing for their future careers
As most job opportunities require languages, these skills are needed in today's world
Looking at career choices, if anyone has learned another language, they will benefit in the future because they have such a lifelong skill.
Having the right ability to speak directly to people from foreign countries brings forward a lot of other people from Hud
YouGov Pol, where more than 4,000 adults in Britain were surveyed in 2013, 75 percent of people were unable to speak a foreign language well, and French is the only language spoken by 15 percent.
That's why children today need to make money in language learning.
In many languages, especially in developing countries, I have increased the opportunities for children to have a good day.
In Scotland, different languages are read in every school
A number of schools focus more on classical modern languages, while others study languages that are considered most important for Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Your child's favorite, free schools will always have a choice of languages, and there will be a theoretical work to be done in this field.
The Scottish Free School aims to provide an educational environment that will equip and equip children with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
In the global business environment at that time, it cannot be denied that languages are very important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "non-international cultural skills".
This will continue to be an option, an opportunity, and a culture for young people in free Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward Scotts Council of Independent Schools Director
Le Brown will start playing for the Links in Diego on Sunday
For those guys who want to see Le Bruno playing for L.A.L.L.L.A., the wait is almost over.
Lake Walton of Lakers announced that he will play against Dinoir Angts in Sunday's "Sunday" game.
But he was not determined how long he would play.
Walton said on Lukers' website that it would be less than 48 minutes away.
Reporter Mike Trodell tweeted that it was possible that James would play for a few minutes
After the project this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Csen Schedule.
He said, "I don't need full-scale games to get ready at this stage of my career."
At the time of the West Virginia Riley of Trump, YouTube Channel
President Trump has been starting a series of railways selected from Heiling in West Virginia since the night.
This is the first of five railway stations scheduled for the coming week, which includes a short walk on friendly spots in including tennis and Mississippi.
Because the Supreme Court's election to hold an empty seat is subject to an authentic vote, the tempo average is trying to provide public support for temporary elections because the Republics are at risk of losing control of the Congolese elections in November.
What time is the real night of Thrupe's West Virginia, and how can you see it online?
There will be 7 hours a week in the West Virginia region of Thramp, Greece, according to the real western time of September 29, 2018.
You can see online via the live stream on the real YouTube of Thrupe, West Virginia.
It is likely that his fiancée for the Trump Supreme Court will talk about the hearing of the week for British Kiev, which has been extended due to allegations of sexual abuse and the FBI's investigation has been supported by an authentic vote of the expected cent for a week until the completion of the investigation.
However, the main objective of the railways is to help Republicans move forward to November elections
Thus, according to the writers, the election of President Thrupe said that the purpose of the next week's rally is to "create in artists and defenders while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in Saints and Ivans."
A member of the Tromp election team who refused to reveal his name told the writers that "it is so important to keep control of the Congress for the Center's agency that they will travel as much as possible to the states as possible while we are in charge of the election session."
According to West Virginia Metro News, wesbanko is located in Erina, and tonight's rally "From Ohio and Pennsylvania will gather hammocks and get a post from the Pittsburgh media."
Last week's tour will be the second time the earthquake hit West Virginia, in which it won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
The Republicans of West Virginia are trying to help the hopeful Patrick Morrisi, who are behind the election in the polls.
According to Reuters, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, Simon Hyder, said that it is not a good sign for Maurice that they need the president to come to Poland."
Reuters Cap 2018: Team U.S.A. is determined to fight to keep hope alive
After three sessions, the driver was killed on the afternoon of the week against the couple.
The extent of the pandolm's movement is completely designed to play, but an idea in which players believe in the heart, and it will never happen as much as it does in comparison with them.
Or do they say: "Where is the (final) decision?"
Walking around that day, Jordan Spythe said, "They got six points and now they're four, so I think we're taking it as a little bit of a move.
Of course, Europe has a superior, with four points ahead while they can try to get more and more.
As Spythe said, the Americans feel that their feelings are still little and they have enough to hope for, especially in the form of Spythe and Jonathan Thomas, who played together all day and each one had three points.
The song is about to be thrown into the hole, and they've set an example.
When their round was running, the cries of the sorrows were rising high when they slightly beat the ball into the hole and put four or four cats into their names -- at a time when Thomas and they were behind two points after two points
When they were hit by a 15-gall, they were so happy to hear the screams of the cops, as they tell you, they don't think the American team is out of the game yet.
Spythe says you just have to work hard for your match and worry about it.
It's just that each of these players has gone now.
There are 18 halls left on the famous road.
In the past two days, Sputh and Thomas are the only players who have scored more than two points, Francesco Minori and Tommy Flatwood, a Muslim story from the Reuters Cup.
Europe's team is amazing, but this desirable couple is perfect and they don't expect mistakes.
The only couple were "Molewood" who didn't shoot a bug on the afternoon of the week, but they saved bugs on the morning of the week, on the afternoon of Friday, and then on the morning of Friday.
This race, and the way their energy moves from and to these stormy adventures, confirms that they are the only players who will be able to catch up on Sunday, and that they will have no favorite player except the flatwood or the millery that will ensure the possible victory of the European team when the sun will be set on the National Gulf.
They're both preferably on different halls together.
Europe's beautiful things are before time, though.
Boba Watson and Web Sempson immediately completed their work on Forbals in the morning when her partner Alex was with the lights.
One of the first nine surgeries and two dobels dropped the Spanish and Swedish couples into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, though, you won't be able to help get out of the hole
Dealings between couples, advice they give, advice they don't give, and how some practical wisdom changes in a moment's life are great to see in the morning and in the afternoon.
So far, the European team has played a good game as a team and has remained superior until the last day, but this Forum session has shown that team U.S.A. is also encouraged to fight, which some people are doubting as a special state side.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of the radiator cup
On the day of the week in the United States, fast bales and rapid jumps will appear on the last day of the European Driver Cup with a clear superiority after gaining the top 10-6 in the US.
Tommy Flatwood and French Minori's exhilarating couple started two fights on the Tigger Woods in the conflict and have so far taken their tele to four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Beyron's European team, who tried to keep his traffic lost two years ago in Hazeltin, was on the American team in the morning, and won a 3-1 race.
The U.S. has more resistance to forces and won two matches, but the loss has not been met.
There are eight points required in 12 rounds of Sunday matches to keep the Jam Fourk team traffic.
Flatwood is a barrier to the European team (newly loaded players) which has gained four points at a time when they were paired with the monarchy, which is the moon of "Molewood" after a Sansy Hezwick and the first pair in the history of the Reuters Cup, which won four points in its first four matches.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the ambulances, they defeated Wwoods and the U.S. ban together in the best way possible.
Woods, who managed hard to make it through the two matches on the week, showed her excellent match, but she lost 19 matches from her immediate balsam and 29 of her immediate sams and seven of them.
Joton day, who rested in the morning against the balsams, returned to Sams to accompany Henry Stanson, and Dustin Janson and Bax Kapaca, who are the first and third world rankings, defeated 2+1.
Europe's team in South Paris failed to accept a happy and windy day in a western area.
Three times the great champion of the shop, Jordan Spythe and Joton Thomas, set a standard for Americans with two points a week.
He immediately won a victory over Spain's soul in Balz and Ain Polter from 2+1 and then defeated Polter and Miklarea from 4-3 after losing two underground hellos in Soms.
In the history of the rider cup, only two times a team has returned to the game after losing four points, although the four team needed only match to keep traffic.
After two days on the other number, however, it seems Sunday's response will be out of reach.
North Korea is saying that without confidence, "there is no question" is unarmed on the one hand
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on the Sabbath that the bans were undermining their country's confidence in the United States, and there was no question that their country had nuclear weapons on the one hand.
Rey Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Agency that North Korea had taken "the possible measures to prevent nuclear and missile testing, eliminate nuclear testing sites and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology last year.
He said, but we don't see a reaction from America.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national peace, and in no circumstances will we be alone before we are unarmed.
When Rey reiterated North Korea's allegations of resistance to the "Mahala War" of the few atom weapons, it appears from the report that he did not completely reject the few weapons on the one hand, as Pong Yang was doing in the past.
On 12 June, Rey referred to a joint statement that followed the first meeting between the US President and the leader of North Korea, who had pledged to try to "clean the Korean Charter with nuclear weapons", while the earthquake promised to ensure the peace of North Korea.
North Korea wants to end the Korean war in 53-1950, but the United States has said that Pung Yang will destroy his atomic weapons first
Washington has also resisted demands to mitigate severe international restrictions on North Korea.
Rey said that the United States is insisting on "the first few atoms" and is forced to increase pressure by means of restrictions on its purpose and even on "the declaration of the end of the war".
The idea that restrictions can force us to fall is a misconception of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that bans are growing in untrustworthy confidence
Rey didn't mention any plans to meet with other leaders between small and small, which the U.S. president has previously seen in the United Nations.
Instead, in less than five months ago, the minister mentioned three visits between the leaders of South Korea -- and he added: "If this small nuclear issue were not a South Korea party, the United States would not have found such a conflict in the Korean Army."
However, Ray's speech was dramaticly different from last year's speech, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the US country with the North Korean rockets, after setting up a self-inflicted mission from the "Master Satanic President" Tromp, has become a challenge.
Thrupe, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised the few measures taken by the United Nations in the United Nations, but said that there are still a lot of work to be done and that there should be bans on the destruction of nuclear weapons from North Korea.
The fat guy, Trump said he doesn't have a time frame for him, it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations peace should reward Pung Yang for the measures taken by the Council.
However, outside the U.S. secretary, Mike Pompiou told the United Nations Peace Council to Agarrats: "The Council's reservations must continue unabated and unscrupulous until we reach the goal of a complete, complete and validated little atomme weapon."
The Peace Council has increased restrictions from 2006 to 2006, in an effort to prevent funds for Pong Young's atoms and ballistic missiles.
Pompeii met with Ray at the United Nations General Assembly on Side Lines and then told him that they would tour Pong Yang next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but their final trip is not going well.
When he left Pong Yang in July, he said he was ahead, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of demanding "like pigs".
North Korea promised to eliminate an easy way to make a meeting with me this month and an atomic complex if the United States is taking "responsive measures"
He said, "Nearly told them that "responsive measures" include peace assurances they want, which were promised by the earthquake, and measures to facilitate relations with Washington."
Getting a good amount of sleep in the course of the Hard Demand
Harold University has urged all of its inner graduates to get more sleep this year under a new course so that they can cope with the growing male tradition through "Divine Nights" with the help of Kafin.
One education Dan learned that students at the University of First Numbers in the world are often unknown when words are very basic, such as how to think.
Professor of Sleeping Drugs at Harvard Medical School and a specialist Charles Sysler at the Free Ham and Vones Hospital, who is said to be the first of his kind in the United States.
After giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on the reading process, they were moved to start the course.
She said, “A girl came to me at the end of the story, and said, ‘Why am I told this when I am younger?’
He told me that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep -- a fact that surprised me.
This course, which began this year on the first demand, explains how good gold habits help in teaching and playing, and also improves their general mood.
Professor of Mental Disease and Health at Harvard Medical School, Executive Director Paul Berra, said that the University decided to give a course after learning that there is a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a relationship of work.
In a section, there is a picture of the hotel's room, where demanders are affected by the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects the performance of games, and they click enough cups, screens, coaches, and books to learn the importance of gold.
In another section, partners are told how long sleep-free heart, stroke, depression, and cancer increase the risk of cancer
With elaborate models, a map of the campus encourages a person to think about his daily routine.
Paul Cessler further said, we know that the demand will not change immediately.
But we think that they have the right to know -- just like you have the right to know about their health effects when choosing tobacco.
He said that there is still a tradition of pride in "getting up all night," and he added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on demand means that sleeplessness is an increasing problem.
He said make sure that you sleep well enough to cope with pressure, fatigue and anxiety, there must be 'secret weapons' of the suitor -- even to avoid the motpa, because sleepless brains put in hunger mode, which makes them feel constant hunger.
A 19-year-old student in California named Raymond So, who is studying chemistry and natural life, has helped Professor Paul Sysler to prepare for the course, who had taken a class in Harrod last year.
He explained that the course opened his eyes and made peace in it to try to start the course in the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will complete all the post graduates before they join the association.
Professor Cisseller has advised that the caller should consider alarming about when to go to bed and when to wake up and they should be aware of the effects of ‘blue light’ coming out of the breech screen and LED light. This light can create an unfair balance in your day-to-day changing system and create sleep problems.
Winnings from a zero on Lungston: Menga hit Gerard's players with a bullet
Regents was alarmed when a hit by Dolly Menga beat Stephen Gerard's unresolved team in Lungston with a bullet.
Iberox's team was looking to record its first victory in February 4-1 in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team played its second hit on Gerard in 18 games and kept his team away from Leaderbrook's Prime Minister's Leaders holding only eight points.
Menga fired seven minutes ago and never was able to stop her without a sense of enthusiasm.
While the Ringers are now on number six, Lungston is on number three and only behind the Hebrew.
Gerard may have more problems when he was hit by throwing something from the other end of the line on the Colum Spence.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which led to the finals of the Ir Bitford Cup.
On the other hand, Holt came out with the same Livi 11 who gave a point from last week's Harts and he'd be happy to see how his turn on each turn reduced the spirits of his opponents.
The Rings may have remained a haven, but Lionstone kept the song under control.
They were only able to score within two minutes of the start of the game when Scott Putmin hit the ball in the goal of Allen MacGreger for the first time, but Medfielder saved time.
By the time Kengo Jackets got to the Free Cooking Captain Craig Hallite, but his defense partner, Ellen Lethog, was only thrown to the back post.
The Rangers would have gained control of the game, but in the final part of the third was only hopeful of their play.
Alfredo Murillos must have felt that he had a panel on his fourth-hour mark when he broke between him and Stephen Lalis, but the refrehensive Stephen Thomson rejected Colombia's appeals.
Reiners could only hit two shots on the target in the first Hof, but Iberox's previous bullet shot, Leam Kelly, did not have to deal with the weak shot of Lasana Calibali's head and the Ove Garia.
While Levi's opera game could have been against the opening of the game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that it was their first need.
Once again, the Ringers failed to cope with the Jacks.
Scott Arefild couldn't react immediately when Decalan Galader threw a ball at Scott Robson and chose Manga to finish his work with a cool taste.
In the break, Gerard replaced Colybally with Riyn Kantt, and the change showed an almost immediate effect when Wanger gave Murilos a smile, but the effect was that he ran away from his line to stop him.
But Lionstone kept forcing the guests to play their own game while others were playing long long shots after Lethog and Halkitt.
The Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last step when Luther threw it from corner to head to Jackbes, but MacGreger went on his way and made their efforts fail.
In exchange for the Rangers, Glen Mudleton claimed that a panel was delayed when he left with Jackbes, but Thomason ignored it.
TEKIM: The Mood of Gager Counter
And now a page from the "Saturday Morning" phenomenon: today, 136 years ago, counting, 30 September 1882, the well-known nature of the future was created in Germany by Johannes William Hans.
Gager developed a method of measuring and measuring the image, which was an invention that eventually caused the Gauger counter tool.
It has been supported not only by science but also by the populace of Calcutta, as seen in the 1950s in the "Belles of Coronado", where scientists R. R. R. R. and Del Evans appear to be unimaginable:
(Man) said: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a counter, which is used as a tool for making the U.S.
When you put these phones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that come from radiation in the world."
Johns: "Yes, it's really popping up!"
Hans Gagger died a few days before his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But the plan with their name is still alive.
Cancer’s new vaccine system can train the immune system to ‘view’ the underlying cells
Cancer's new vaccine system can train the immune system to "see" and kill them.
It helps the system to identify antibodies as part of the vaccine treatment
The procedure involves removing and converting a patient into a laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that is common in every cancer, and then it is brought back into the body.
This test vaccine is showing positive results in various types of cancers.
A woman who has been treated with this vaccine has been missing for more than 18 months in Denis, who is training the anti-Vaccine force to point to peripheral cells.
In a way, getting out of a patient's power supply, converting them into a lab so that they can have the most common protein in all of the cancers that HER2 says can be seen, and then it involves reintroducing these cells into the body.
Bethsda, professor of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, J.B.S.A., in my country, said: "Our results show that we now have a very hopeful vaccine.
Professor Brzyfky stated that HER2 "is the cause of many types of cancers" including cancer of the skull, the child's den, the lungs and the brain.
Preventive treatment of patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has also been successful in treating some kind of practical leukemia.
The wave of West, after its SNL operation, praised the wave of maga hats
It's not doing any good!
He praised US President Donald Trump for his stand-up campaign and said that he would fight to re-elect the president in 2020, after protesting against the West during the show's Security Day Live Show.
On that night, after presenting his third song, which was called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a large American hat, he sang Harzels against Democracy and re-assembled his support for the drum.
"As often as you speak to a white person, they say, 'How do we like the trumpet? He's a descendant.'
He said, "Yes, if I were concerned about sex, I would have moved from America a long time ago."
SNL started with Met Damon with a sketch in which Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony against the statement of sexual harassment by Christine Blossy Ford in front of the Court Committee of the City of Brit Kivan.
Although he had not been released, West's grassy series was uploaded to the social media by Chris Rock.
Whether or not Rock wants to update West by this post.
In addition, West allegedly complained that he had to face a difficult time behind the stage because of his hat
"They threatened me after the stage.
He said, "Don't go to the station with this hat."
He threatened me!
According to Washington Aegeaner, he told me that then he told me that I was in a crash place."
West said, "Do you want to see where you're going?" He said, "He's going to keep his top hat, because that means you can't tell me what I'm going to do.
"Try love."
The Wright magazine reported that because of his comments, he probably expressed his displeasure at least twice, and SNL officials were alarmingly saying to the magazine, "Pora Studio was completely silent."
West was replaced by the Glacier Aryan Grand, whose former friend Ripper Mler died a few days earlier.
West had put many of his songs, such as the Piraeus bottle, indistinct from ‘I love him’.
West had the support of the Chief Canadian Turner of TPUSA, who tweeted: "Hail to one of the most encouraging spirits: thank you for fighting the coup."
But Tak Shaw's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just expressing her personality, and it's definitely amazing.
"So I have chosen not to reward a person (who buys his music, or wears his clothes, or defends his fan) who I think is thinking of himself and his future that is due to my community.
He's free.
So we're free." They said more.
Before the show, Ripper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name and now he's "officially known as Kenya West."
He's not the first fan to change his name, and he's following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, Puff and Paddy.
The partner of Rapper Shinup Doug was the Sunop Line, and the former music legend Prince had, of course, turned his name into a symbol.

The Star Cut Herrington of Game of Thrones was severely harassed by the masculine male of the Star Cut Herrington
Cut Herrington HBO is famous for the role of sword-throning player in the violent video game of the HBO.
However, 31-year-old executives strongly criticized the hero's intrusive bar tradition and said that showing such a role on screen means that young people often feel that they will have to be tough enough to gain respect.
Talking to The Sande Times Calcuttaer, Cutt said they understood ‘something wrong’ and asked how to deal with the problem of the Zahrali man at #MeToo.
Cuts who recently married Lezley, 31-year-old, a member of the Game of Thrones, admitted that they are serious enough to prepare for the problem
He said, "I'm personally serious at the time that we've made a mistake in fostering a male puppie."
What are we teaching men when they were growing up, about the problem we're seeing?
Cutts believe that televised television in the promotion of the fertilized male can be responsible for its very male fans on a stand-alone basis.
And they said, “Is there any creation, and is there one who has been taught?”
What is taught on TV, and in the throats, makes boys realize that they have to have a particular attitude to become a man.
I think it's a big question of our time -- how do we change this respect?
'Cause it's obvious that something's wrong with training young men.'
They also admitted in the interview that when the game of trones ends in the next winter, they won't go any further, because they've been ‘falling off the field of war and horses’.
From November to November, a film producer and his brother, who will be shown in the restoration of the True West film by Sam Schefferd, based on the story of a lawyer.
Officials recently expressed the fact that they consider their wife to be the best gift they've ever received from Game of Thrones.
He said, "I got into this with my wife, so she gave me my future family and a new life ahead of her.
The day played a role in the role of cut hearing in the imagination of the M.E.E.A.D.
In June 2018 he was married to Lezley's family guard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14 percent increase in new cases in China
China has announced an increase of 14 percent in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical contractors have reported that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by this.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second six months of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been affected by sexual relations, which is against the tradition of the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV affects spread rapidly through blood transfusions.
However, at a conference in the Greek province, Chinese medical contractors reported that the number of people affected by HIV has decreased by almost zero.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China
In China in 1997, we considered sex violence to be impossible, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is still common.
Because of the country's strong values, studies have estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of these diseases are due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In order to address this issue, the Chinese government has promised to have access to HIV drugs from 2003 to 2003.
Maxine Waters overrun his staff and leaked the data from the GOP Center, a 'dangerous lie' and a 'disgusting idea'.
Mexican Waters, a member of the U.S. Ivans, charged that one of their actions published personal information from three republican senators on the web pages of the lawmakers' website.
Democrat Crohn from Las Angeles insisted that such claims are being made by "most right-handed" pendants and websites.
In a Twitter story, the veterans said, "This is all a lie, a lie, a lie."
In the reported information, the U.S. Centers from South Carolina took over the London Gram and Otah Michael and included the addresses and phone numbers of the homes of the N. Hach.
Information was made available online, which was published during the hearing of the Senate Panel on the allegations of sexual immorality by a member of the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
This information has been written shortly after the Centers objected to Kiev.
Hall reported on sites such as the Gateway Pentat and the Red State that are linked to the I.P.E. Waters' office, and also reported on the maintenance of Waters' activities.
Waters further said that this baseless accusation is completely false and a clear lie.
Keep my actions, whose identity, personal information and protection have come under threat as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, are not responsible for writing this information anyway.
This baseless accusation is a completely false and obvious lie.
Waters' statements were immediately reviewed online, including the former press secretary of the White House.
Felix wrote that it's so angry.
It turns out they don't like holding on to the Congolese.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
They don't have to work hard.
They should not be questioned about the purpose of the accuser.
Let them be content and grateful.
It seemed that, compared to the response of Fisser Waters, the judge was criticising the democratics on Kivano, and the Nazis accused him of being very angry at the hearing of the riots on Kivano.
In the mid-term elections, in the face of the hopeful republics of Waters, Navaru also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
He said, “This is a great news, if you are truthful.”
In his story, Waters said that their office has alerted the authorities of law regarding these fraudulent allegations.
And they said: We will most certainly make sure that those who are responsible are made to look on and they are made to be responsible for what they do, and they are made to be the losers of what I do.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review of the Universe of Unauthorised Investigator Roan Atkanson
It has now become a tradition that no British movie shows the importance of the visit, but this is not true of the latest news by Johnny English's action team, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will there be a new opportunity to bring out the people on this article, how clearly we are the cracks?
In any case, the eyes came out and the face of the frog had a license to refresh things a second time - and that its signs were a broader design for non-English and Sinami regions than anything else.
He is, of course, a crazy secret agent who, in spite of his strange and poor designs, has a few features of the class, the glory of Mr. Ben and the London Olympx summit in 2012 that only one head of the Chariots of Fire's subjects is involved.
Its role is basically based on the travel of President Atkinson and an international man who used to come to Baroque's TV TV news and left the post.
This latest JE exit has one or two good moments.
I liked to be in the gold of Johnny Coron the center of Melbos, and I liked to go up to a helicopter with the blood of the church from his shirt.
For a physical comedy, Atkinson is on display, but he's not alive in the game, and he looks strangely designed, especially "Sinjid" film brand like 007 and Mission Impossible are now presenting the game with confidence as an item.
It feels funny that it's for young children instead of adults, and I don't think that young English movements are as dramatic and modern as those of the Ben are silent attunes.
Now the permanent district sentence is that the British general is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered the very secret web site and is revealing the identification of all British agents in the field, now he has become head of pain for the agent on duty, which is a very minor role for Cane Alden.
This is the final support for a vice-president who is a weak heart of beauty, who is already the victim of a complete political name, Emma Thampson, who plays the role of this secret three-way meter in the best way, but the script does not have much life.
Their intelligence consultants tell us that every active investigator is in danger, they're going to have to bring a retired person.
And that's what it means to bring mistakes to Jonny English, who now works as a school master in a clothing area, but brings up a survey of the record team: in some places, it's difficult to stop laughing because Jonny's school of research is running a school of rock type.
Johnny is brought to the White Hall for a Hungarian briefing, and his former long-term partner (Bough) is reunited with him, whose role is playing in the middle of the day.
Bo is now a married man, all of whom are Marian's commanders, a July Haki Stock, in which Vice-Papridin is a bit of a waste.
So at the Queen's High Secret Service, Beth-Man and Robin are back to the act of oblivion, where they face the beautiful month of Olympia Ophelia Baltofa.
Dr. Etenai, the vice-president, is dangerously going through the magic of a special Tek Arab page that claims he can solve the concerns of the British computer: Manhos Jessen Walla, whose role is to play by Jack Lise
Johnny and Boo begin their story with their funny color reels; they set fire to a French restaurant in the wake of the wind; they set themselves up on a volta craft and create embodiments; and Joni English builds the lumloki when he tries to use the virtual reality headset to get familiar with the entrances of the volta home.
All the pauses have certainly been saved for this end, but the interesting and stormy game, the whole movie looks like you're watching children's TV.
There's a lot of media stuff.
And as with the other movies in Jonny England, I always have to think that the British film industry can't do any good to the Rowan Attkson that can do justice to it?
The Libre Party has argued that it is planning for British people to work four days a week, but pay five days a week.
The Crimean Librarian Party is considering a revolutionary project under which British people will work four days a week, but they will be paid five days a week.
According to the news, the party wants the company's employees to spend an additional day freeing up their business and moving the rest of the workers through the revolution of creative intelligence.
Under it, employees will enjoy three days of wake-up -- but houses will be taken as long as they were before.
The media said it would be 'museum' for the party's multi-stakeholder agendas and projects that want to move the country towards workers.
Union Congress has verified that the trades of the move to the four-day period have been able to benefit workers from a changed economy.
A senior media member of the Liberian Party told The Sande Times what to expect before the end of the year is announced.
It won't be that night, but the four-day week is a move that is fit for the party's overall industrial wisdom to work, except for re-employers.
The Libre Party is not the first group to confirm this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day weekly election.
However, in general, the Libre Party is not confirming this image.
One of the liberator's translators said: "The four-day week car is not a party's policy and is not under consideration by the party
Chancellor John McDonald used his imagination to present the Leber Conference last week to bring socialist revolutions into the economy.
Mr. McDonald said they are committed to regaining power from 'directors of non-facets' and profit-bearing bears in the EU's companies.
The Chancellor of the Uzb dispute also means that the present shareholders in the water companies will not be able to get back their full share because the Liberian government can 'crowds' because of the alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed the plans to include workers in the company boards and to transfer 10 percent of private sector companies to Moldova to establish a state fund, which will benefit workers up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Grammar, John Candy tells "60 minutes" if the investigation against F.B.I.C.C. will change their minds
The investigation of the FBI against Aljamates by Judge Brett Kivano in the Supreme Court has delayed at least one final vote on their recruitment for at least a week and raises questions as to whether the investigation of the Beirut will force any republican senators to return to their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, author Scott Pilee, author of the "60 Minutes", asked the Republican Senators John Candy and the London newspaper if FBI would find something that would encourage them to change their mind.
Canadian South Carolina was more upset with her partner.
Candy said, "I mean, of course.
I spoke at the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kivan.
Then I called out to him and said: 'Have you done this?'
They were in a position of great honor, and great honour, and great honour.
However, there was no apparent improvement in the intention of the summit.
He said he's stopped his opinion about Brit Kivano and needs a dynamite charge to change it.
I don't know what happened with Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett has been greatly shaken. They were referring to Christine Blossy ford.
No one can confirm the name of God.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any major changes.
What's the Global Seat Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This week, the New York Global Sitizen will host the Festival, which is the annual music festival in which a number of well-known viewers display their imagination and have so much impact on its mission: the end of world poverty.
In its seventh year, thousands of people will gather at the Global Sitizen Festival in the Central Park Grand Lan, not only to enjoy the glamour of Gent Jackson, Cardie B and Shan Mands, but to warn of its real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Sitizen Festival, which is an extension of the World Poverty Project in early 2012, is an international news group that wants to increase and end poverty among active anti-poverty workers.
A free ticket for this mail (if you want to pay for a VP ticket is different) will complete some tasks or "active" for the Concentrate Stakeholders, such as volunteering, e-mailing a global leader, calling a phone or warning about the end of poverty.
But how successful is the Global Headquarters in fulfilling its goal while only 12 years remain?
Is the idea of offering people free concerts a real way to convince people to take action, or is it another form of Calcutta Islam, which people think they're doing a lot of work by signing an online ticket or by sending a tweet?
Global Sitizen says that since 2011, he has recorded 19 million of his soldiers' "active" on the demands of various elephants."
He said that these actions have encouraged global leaders to declare promises and policies beyond $37 billion, which will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 promises and announcements generated by its activities, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or aggregated.
The group is of the opinion that the funding received has so far directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Some important promises include the power of notation, which is part of Britain's fundraiser and fundraiser, and which is committed to "helping children with their full capacity to cope with depression", he promised to provide $35 million to help end the food chain in Rwanda after consulting global sites.
In April 2018, Supreme Trice Almin of The Power of Notation told the House during a live concert in London that with the help of the British government, foreign governments, national governments and you, we could make the social injustice of food a story of the past.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 demands to improve food for mothers and children from Britain, the government announced a project, a power of neutronization, to provide funding, under which 5 million women and children benefit from food requirements.
In answer to a question on your website, "What makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Sitizen said: This is a long and difficult journey - we will sometimes fall and fail
But, like incentives against civil rights and racial prejudice, we are also successful, because together we are more powerful.
In New York this year’s event will include the hosting of Jeant Jackson, Weeknd, Shan Mandis, Cardie B and Geneil Mona, who will be hosting Debora Le Frances and Hi Jack Mena.
Russians can use their seas for "blocked" U.S. to disrupt their energy outputs -- the U.S.
U.S. Undersecretary Rhyneke has discovered, as Washington E.G. reported, that "if necessary" Washington uses its seas to prevent the Russian power from reaching the east, including its engines.
Janka has accused the Russian government of finding new power plants in the evening, which is the country's chief executive at the invitation of the Russian government.
He said that I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is to encourage energy, as they are doing in Eastern Europe, which is the southern belly of Europe.
And with them are means of escape.
He said that the United States has the capacity to make sure that the seas are open, and if necessary, they should be shut down so as not to reach their power supply.
The woman's consumer was talking at a conference held by Energy Alliance. This alliance is an useless group that describes itself as "the voice of power users" in the United States.
They compared Washington's wisdom to the practical and effective ways of getting rid of Russia and Iran, and they have been effectively exploited in them.
They referred to Russia as "a treacherous horse" whose economy is dependent on fuel storage, said the economic option for Iran and Russia is dependent on less and more fuel and change it.
These statements have come to light at a time when Europe is working on an increase mission for its natural gas supply to replace Russia, which is a simpler option for European users.
In this regard, the members of the Tromp Administration, including President Donald Tromp himself, are trying to convince Germany that they will be able to access the "non-proportional" node stream 2 pipe line, which, according to the Tromp, has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion log node stream 2 pipe line, which will double the current pipe line's capacity by taking 110 billion cubic metres, is specifically a cross-sectional project.
Krimlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only due to radical reasons and is an example of unethical correlation.
In September, after meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nouak, in Moscow, said that I believe that energy should not be used as a tool to exert pressure and that users should be able to choose suppliers.
Germany has severely criticized the situation in the United States, and the project is a review of its relevance.
Germany's first-class organization for manufacturing, the Federation of German Instrers (BDI) told the United States that they remained far away from bilateral agreements between the U.S. Power Police and Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kampf, head of the Federation of German Instresses (BDI), said after a recent visit between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Ledamer Puton that I am very sorry when a third country is involved in our energy supply.
Massachusetts's secretary, Al-Zabahi, said she would "consider the Sinji" when she took part in the presidential election in 2020.
Senator Al-Zabahani, of Massachusetts, said that after the mid-term elections she would "consider" the "Sinji" when she took part in the presidential election.
During a Town Hall meeting in Hollywood, residents confirmed that they would consider taking part in the election
According to the resolution, he said it's time for women to turn to Washington and fix our failed government, and he needs a woman in power.
He said that after 6 November I will take serious consideration of the fight for the President's election.
During the Town Hall, the people strongly attacked President Donald Tromp and said, "They're taking this country in the wrong direction.
He said I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy.
The officials are strongly criticizing the British Court for the shocks and their Supreme Court.
Araha, on a Twitter, said that we definitely need an F.B.I. study before we vote.
However, a survey conducted on mergers revealed that the majority of the people in their rounds have the view that they should not take part in the 2020 election.
According to the Police Center/Boston Globe of Soffolk University, 58 percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said they should not take part in the election.
Twenty percent supported the election.
The survey has shown more support for participation by former Governor Diell Patrick, under which 38 percent supported possible participation and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high profile democratic names, which are being discussed about the choice of 2020, include former vice presidents, both Byden and Vermont's Centre Bernie Sanders.
According to the esoteric att press, Byden said they would officially decide by January
Reference to the PTSD of the TRK Paulen in the Rail of the Donald Trump of Sara Paulen
Twenty-six-year-old Turk Paulen spent a year in Iraq after his arrival in September.
He was arrested and convicted on Monday night in a case of domestic violence.
He told a rally for the Donald Troupe in the area of Oklahoma that after my son came from there, I could feel the pain of other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers are returning with.
Paul made his arrest "unmanageable in the room" and said about his sons and other soldiers, "They come back a little different, they come back a little hard, they come back, they come back thinking whether what they, their fellow soldiers, Armenians, and all the other members of the army, are appreciated for the country."
According to a translator from the Vasila police force Dan Bent, Turkey Paulen was arrested on Monday from Vasila in Alaska and was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence reports, and the possession of weapons in the state of alcohol.
18 States Support for Challenged D.C.’s New Asylum Policy
The emerging states and District of Colombia are supporting the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that has become corrupt or refuses to protect refugees from domestic violence.
NC News reported that representatives of the occupied states and districts called on Agra to support justice in an attempt to challenge the police from refugees in Washington, D.C.
The case of the Greek Ombudsman's Sessions, which the United States Civil Rights Union launched against the U.S. police in August, did not reveal the full name of the case.
He said his partner and "the sons of his gang members" abused him, but the US covenanters rejected his request for asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Greece's government advocates have made El Salvador, Honduras and Gutte Mala countries that are the most demanding countries for American asylum because they have major problems of corruption and domestic violence.
The new US refugee policy 2014 is against the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed non-registred Turkin to seek refuge from domestic violence.
District of Colombia's Attorney General Carl Resin told the adage in a statement that the new policy "regards the richness of many decades of international law."
The request for assistance with justice states that the Act requires that all claims of asylum be decided on the basis of specific facts and situations and that the policy is a violation of this principle.
In a request, lawyers further argued that the police preventing the entry of the Turkish country is detrimental to the American economy because such individuals can become active and can "provide immediate liberating"
Atarney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop sheltering members of the family from violence and gangs.
Sessions announced on 11 June that only refuge is available for those who leave their homeland because of ethnic, religious, national or social prejudice or political opinion.
It was never meant to reduce all the problems - even all the serious problems facing people around the world.
Efforts to save the affected in Paul’s case continued, double the number of deaths
Most certainly the abode of the living was dearer to the survivors.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Cosoma, who was in a relief center in the affected city of Palo, was comforted by Dhanhal from the relief center.
Every minute, there's an ambulance coming in.
Drinking water is the trickle.
The locals were seen returning to their ruined homes, trying to pick up supplies and what was left of them.
Hundreds of people have been injured and some of the hospital injuries affected by the 7.5 earthquake have been filled.
Dei Hareth, whose room and shoulder had come to the factory, was resting outside the hospital, including some wounded Paulo's army, where patients were being treated outside the building due to earthquakes.
Her eyes began to shed tears when she moved her hotel room to the fifth floor with her wife and daughter.
He said: There was no time to save himself.
Haritz told the essi att press that I had been pushed into the walls, and he added that they had come to the village for a wedding
I heard my wife running for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they'll be safe.
U.S. Sapphira's "propaganda news" charge against China
After a week of announcing four pages of trade benefits between the United States and China in a U.S. daily newspaper in China, the U.S. security officer in China accused the U.S. press of spreading propaganda on the street.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the Chinese Daily's compliments to the latest newspaper, which is the most sold in the state of IIA, after attempting to intervene in the November 6th U.S. elections in China.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. elections is a new step in the growing pressure campaign on China from Washington, U.S.A., to inform writers
While it is common for non-governmental governments to announce trade, there is a strong trade war between Belgium and Washington during which they have declared several rounds of terror on each other's migrations.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that at the beginning of the trade war, China's response to the war was intended to target those who emerged in countries that supported the Democratic Republic of the Congo, such as the EVA.
In China, the former U.S.S.S.S.S. and IVA long-term governor and China, a large-scale teri brinstad of agricultural equipment, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and business operators.
Brenstad wrote in a column in the Des Viens Registry on Sunday that China is increasing advertising in our free press by increasing its threat.
Brenstad wrote that in spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of every courageous freedom of the United States's tradition and free press.
You will be able to hear limited voices against the government at the news stand in China, and you will not see the true picture of the Chinese people's economic policies that you are concerned about, because the media is in the possession of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's best-known newspapers has betrayed his offer to share his article, but he didn't tell me what it was.
Analysts have warned that the Republics of Kiev are depriving women of their vote before the mid-term elections.
As many republics are defending the brand Britain for the Supreme Court against charges of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that they will face its reaction in the medium term, especially from women.
Feelings from this point of view are already very high, and most republics have shown that they want to comment on this.
Professor Gartt Rühr of Political Science at the University of Chicago told The Hall for an article published on the week that you can't ignore this.
Rühr said he did not believe that the demand for an FB investigation would be sufficient to please the angry voters in the last time of Senator Jeff Flek (ar-Arrizuna).
According to the Washington D.C. newspaper, an advanced group of national translators and senior advisor Karen Jane Pierre said that women will not forget what happened last night -- they will not forget it tomorrow and November.
Mike reported that protesting in the Senate on Friday morning, the protesters shouted "The number is coming!" The demonstration has taken place when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee have decided to continue their registration despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blossy Ford.
A foreign political analyst, Steve Nuremberg, told the news site that the democratic spirit and movement would be unexpected.
The people say, "It is the greatest and it is the truth".
But these feelings can be even higher than that, especially in the case of women's votes and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote because they hate the president.
Prior to Ford's public testimony, in which he explained the allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court's registered judge, the investigators suggested that his reaction would be severe if the Republicans decided to continue to confirm the vote.
According to the NC News, former chairman Michael Steel of the Republical National Committee at the beginning of last week said it has become a heart for the G.O.P.
Priorities U.S.A., a group that assists in the election of democracy, Director Goi Cesol told News Channel that the problem is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the arrival of Kivano in the bank, but also how the Republicans coped with the problem and how they did with it (Cristine).
However, after the testimony of Ford and Kivu, it appears that the United States is divided into who to trust, while the recent report has little benefit.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 people believed the testimony of Ford to be true or perhaps true, while 35 percent said that they did or perhaps believe that Kivano was true.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they believe that Kivano may or may not have lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
De Georgin reported that after Flyk's investigation, F.B.I. is currently investigating the charges filed by Debora Ramirez, except for Ford.
Ford explained to the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kivano had abused him when he was 17 years of age.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court of exposing his shame to him during a party in Jel in the 1980s.
Plan to start a new Internet with Google and Facebook of the World Wide Web Museum
Global Wide Web Mued Tom Burners is starting a new project against Google, Amazon and Facebook.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform based on an open source platform.
Sold allows users to know where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Bernardsley said in a joke that Inrupt is the goal of "World Victory"
He said, "We'll have to do it now."
It's a historical moment.
This app uses the software to facilitate the creation of its "online data store" or a POD
Includes contact list, task list, calendar, music library and other personal and leading vice versa tools
It's like Google Drives, Microsoft Outlays, Sales and Satellites are available on a browser at a time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that the user has the right to access what kind of information the user can access.
The company calls it "personal authority through data".
According to company C and John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to combine resources, methods and skills for each company to make available.
At the time, the company Burners, Brooks, I.B.M. purchased a security plate form, some of the on-staff developers and volunteer coders that were placed on the project.
This week, technology developers from all over the world can use the Inrupt website to create their D-Centralized Apps.
Brenners said he and his team are talking to Fis Buck and Google about a complete change to destroy all business models at night.
"We're not asking for permission from them.
In a post published on Media on Sunday, Bernards Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission circular energy and a system to help protect the health and well-being of the new web created on the solo."
Burners Leigh changed the Internet in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners Lee has been calling a strong voice in the debate about the alienity of the net.
Inrupt will also be the founders and directors of the Burnsley World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Brenners Leigh also said that they are far more hopeful about this future distance from the web.
Bernard Van: A ceremony in honor of the priest who won the Victoria Cross in the Great War
During the Great War, the only church of England to win the Victoria Cross was held in their hometown for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Round Bernard Van received this award in an attack on Bellingles and Leacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a print shot and never realized that he had gained the highest honor of the British army.
On the day of the week, in the area of Northampton share, two of his passageways in Rusden covered the memorial stone during a pyramid.
One of their cousins, Michael Van, said that it "is a great sign" that this stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's career.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van passed his battalion through the De Sainte Cointen River through "the most deep fire and the field and machine numbers".
He then quickly led a fire line and led a field gun alone and three detachments ahead of hard, with "greatest strength".
Lieutenant Colonel Van killed a German print on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's work was such that he could never get it done, but it was a humble national service.
After Praed, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, took the lead in the development of flowers under the direction of the Berntwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he felt more honored to participate in the program and "A real hero's strength is being demonstrated by a lot of people."
A night's stay to see M.A.'s officer's ticket 206, instead of having a pop-up.
Imagine that you're a bit full of Bellatour 206 waking up all night just because you're being deprived of the central unit.
There were 13 matches on the San Hozae ticket, including six matches on the main card, which were shown directly on Channel 5 at night in Britain
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gagard Mosesy and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British officials were shocked when the Kurage Pope was turned into a pag.
And indeed, for that they were a people who were not absent [from Allah] until the dawn.
One of the bloggers on Twitter called moving children's cards "a kind of stupid joke".
When asked about the narrations, Belatur's marketing and entertainment vice-president De Shorts said it was the government's power that did not fit for 6 o'clock in the morning, so they had to move to the children's programme.
Yeah, "Pepa The Pag."
Bellatur Company President Scott Koker said he is working on his system to include British officials in the future
Koker said, "I think when we think about reindeer, I think we might be able to figure it out."
But there will be six mornings there on the Sabbath, and We shall not make the Sabbath to appear therein except in accordance with our time.
But we're working on it.
Make sure that when it was changed, many text messages were being read, and they weren't all friends.
We're trying to fax it, we thought it was a technical loss.
But it wasn't, but it was a government problem.
I promise you, the future won't be.
We're going to do five matches instead of six -- as we're just doing, we're trying to make more fun of the suspects, and we can't do that.
This is a desperate situation.
Desert I Land Dess: Tom Dale felt 'less' because of his nature
Olympics Diver Tom Dale says he grew up with a sense of loneliness because of his gender -- but he moved him to become a successful person.
Lucius, Tom, said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "no one was like me."
Speaking in the Dessert I Land Desk programme of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Lauren, he told others that they are talking about the rights of the kind of worshipers.
He told me that as a father, he was worried about winning Olympex.
For a long time, Shu's regular president, Christie Young, has been taking months off because of his illness
In the first part of Lauren's program, Dale explained that she grew up with the feeling that she was "less" than anyone because it was not socially acceptable to boys and girls."
He said, to this day, the feeling of being less and different gave me the strength and ability to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something" because he didn't disappoint anyone when he finally found out about his nature.
In Olympex, the winner of the match twice became a top LGBT player, and this year he appealed to more countries in the Coun-Wilth Games to attack our sex.
He said he's obviously talking because he's feeling good about himself that he was able to live without Awaq and he wants to "give hope" to others.
The three-time global champion said that it was amazing to be caught in love with an American filmmaker named Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013.
Dale married Eskar Everd Duston, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but the age difference never became a problem.
He said that when you were so young, when you had to go through this kind of stuff -- he first went to Olympax at the age of 14 -- and three years later his father died of cancer -- he said it was hard to find someone who was so taller.
The couple became parents of Robert Rae Black-Dile's son, and Dale, in June, told them that he had changed his mind about his life.
He said, “If you had spoken to me last year, everything would have mattered to me about winning the gold.”
Do you know that Olampak's gold medals are bigger than winning?
My Olympus is a gold-plated robe
His son is named after his real father Robert, who died of brain cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Dale said that he didn't accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if he got a ticket for London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, “I did not tell them that you will not be able to remain in the next row.”
He told me that I had caught his hand when he took his last breath and I stayed with him until he took his last breath, and I finally admitted that he wasn't incapacitated.
Next year, Delhi participated in Olympx 2012 and won the Cosy Cup.
He told me that I only knew that I had dreamed of him all my life -- to dive into some Olympic games in front of the home crowd.
He was also moved to choose his first song -- from Proud's memory to Olympx's preparation -- and he's still raising his voice.
Desert I Land Dess Sunday 11:15 is presented on BC Radio 4 according to British time
Out of Form McClesson was added to the reader's room on Sunday.
The U.S. F.M. will set up a record on Sunday when they play their 47-year-old rider cup game, but they will have to rebuild their form to avoid creating an unpleasant stone mill.
Mikleson, who is playing 12 times a record against every six months, has been included on the day of the week by Captain Jim Fourk for fast bales and fast sams.
Instead of being the focus of people's eyes, which he's often on for America, the five-time champion M.C.U. has divided his day into working on his game to play a leading role and to remove his weaknesses.
They can't even throw a straight ball in their careers, so the 48-year-old player is not fit for the National Golf course, where the long open country is punishing the wrong shots.
And even though the course is not so difficult as it is, on Sunday, at the ninth of May, MacLean will be against the British Open Campion Francesco Monastery, who will live together with Tommy Flatwood and live together this week with their four matches.
If an American who's at the beginning of 12 matches is at the loss of four points at the beginning of the game, the game of the micals can really prove important.
Fork expressed confidence in his player.
He said: verily she perceiveth what she hath done this day, so she hath made a hole in my back, and she hath cast her arms round me, and said: verily she is about to-morrow ready.
He has full trust in Him.
He's a fan of popularity, and in the past, and this week he's given these teams a lot.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought more than that, but what was going to happen was happening and maybe we thought so.
Like any other player, he wants to be in the field.
He'll break the record of playing the game of the best player in good folder on Sunday.
It may end up with his driver's cup career, but he doesn't match his individual record heights.
Miklesen has achieved 18 times success, 20 times failure and seven times the same score, although Fourk said his presence gave him a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he's funny, he's tense, he's lazy, he likes to hit people and he likes to kill the team's room.
I think young players enjoy it, and it was a week of fun.
He's got a lot more than a game.
European Captain Thomas Berryn knows the big lead may soon be gone.
Europe's Captain Thomas Berryn knows from his experience that the driver's cup can easily turn into a bit of a worry in the face of the darkest day of the day.
The Danish player started his career in Waldram in 1997 with a team of up to five points in the captainship of Sue Balsterus, but they succeeded with a very narrow margin of 141⁄2-131.2 when they reached the finish line.
Warren said, "You remind yourself that we had a big lead in Waldram, a big lead in Brook Line, where we were beaten and living in Waldram, but with a little margin.
So history told everyone in the team that the case was not over.
Today we're going to the field tomorrow with complete preparation.
They're going to do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the point on the board.
We have one goal, and it's that this traffic gets won and our whole attention is focused on it.
I've always said that I focus on 12 players on my side, but we know very well that our fight is one of the best players in the world.
On a hard golf course, Berryn said more pleased with the work of his players; I never rushed into it.
Tomorrow we'll be raised with a different plague.
There will be individual operations that will be clear tomorrow, and it's a different thing to do.
When conditions are favorable, it's great to be in the field with a partner, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is tested.
The same message is that you have to fully prepare players and take full advantage of their abilities.
Now you're leaving your partner behind and you have to go and show him your full potential.
In the face of the Berryn, the opposite numbers are expected to show a better performance against their players, by the Mosquito Jordan Spythe and Giton Thomas, who raised three of the four points.
On both sides of these unexpected major changes of the last day, he was defeated after becoming part of the Fath team in Brook Line when the European team won the "Medina's Grace".
When he was asked how to take his players to the final day of the year in 1999, he said, "I remember every word of it."
We're going to have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you're going to want to get to this fast start as you saw in the Brook line, as you saw in the median.
When she's on one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the fields.
We're going to put our lines in order, and we're going to get our players to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the response attack and will be with other Europeans at the Top of the Top of the Cup with Rory Meklarai and Paul What, Joton Day, John Ramoum, Tommy Flatwood and In Polter and Line Up in the Top of the Top of the Cup.
Byeren said about his blizzard's exploits, "I'm keeping my players in this order because I think it's all about the game.
Once again, Germany’s new warship was merged
The German Navy's new frigate had to be commissioned in 2014 to take over sea-ships from the Cold War, but this could not be until at least next year, according to local media, due to the lack of systems and hosherbs.
The Die Zeit newspaper told an army translator that the first ship to be prepared for the new Boden-Würtmberg class frigates was now supported by the commission of the "Rain Land Falls" for the first time in 2019.
This marine vessel was scheduled to join the sea in 2014, but after Deleuri's disturbing problems, the original project has been damaged.
Four of the Boden-Wortmberg class ships, which were given by the Order of the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is estimated that on these ships a powerful helicopter, various types of aircraft will be installed, with the exception of intelligence technology such as redosed radar, infrared and satellite tools.
Other important features include longer periods of Mantens - modern frigates can be assigned away from their home port for two years
However, Dia Zite points out that the latest warships will be permanently abandoned when they enter service. It is said that this ship will enable Germany to demonstrate its strength across the sea.
A few F125 Phrigettes arrived in the Red Sea last year when Germany's sea refused to commission the ship officially and sent it back to Hamburg to the Bloom & Ves shop yard.
It's the first time that the sea has returned a ship after Delaware.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to "a number of heavy copies of software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if it was assigned to the Serbian mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because the Boden-Wortmberg class ships had to operate only 120 cylinders, which is about half the individual force on the old Bremen class ships.
It also came to the fore that the weight of the seaplane was far greater, which limits its operation to less and to the future capacity to add upgrads to the sea.
It is estimated that 7,000 tons of tons of Indian landfalls were used by Germans in the second major war, with twice as many of the ships of the same class.
In addition to the lack of hardware, the whole project's scope of training has also become a problem.
It is said that its score is more than the first 2.2 billion euros than the first 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion dollars) of alcohol.
New Phrygets is growing in the light of the recent major developments in the problems facing Germany's sea power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans Peter Butles, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that there is a shortage of ships capable of being assigned to the sea.
The undertaker said that the problem has become heavy over time, because the old ships have been completed but their replacements have not been provided.
He expressed regret that there are no Phrygets in the Boden-Wortmberg class in the Navy.
Research into the Secret Life of National Trusts
The aim of the new research carried out in a Scottish Highlands survey is to find out how light bulbs use natural perception to find food
Its results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these domestic animals and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland include long-coloured hearings and daubon lamps in the study of the Environment Gardens in Western Russia, as well as the general and sporadic papyrus trilis.
Special records will be kept in the entire area at important locations to monitor the activities of the lighthouses throughout the entire season.
H.H.S. will perform a mobile survey using the manual detector and volunteers.
A review of the sound of all the recordings will reveal what frescoes of the light bulbs are doing and what types are being done.
A map and report of the birth boom will be prepared to prepare a detailed picture of their behavior.
The NTS's natural security advisor, Dur, expressed the hope that the results would show what areas of birth control are most important and how they are used for all kinds of purposes.
This information will help to determine the benefits of birth control, such as the establishment of a plant for lighthouses and relevant species and the maintenance of forests.
In Scotland and Britain, there has been a marked decline in lighthouse populations over the past century.
Their populations are at risk of building and advancing work that affects their homes and births.
With the exception of wind-driven turbines and lights, some chemical particles and plant bubbles of flammable paper and building material are also at risk for them.
The lamps are not really dark.
However, because of their habit of fishing at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a fish
She uses a specific echo-location technique to detect worms and obstacles in her flight path
N.T.S., who is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 37 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes the lighthouses very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly do research, assess housing, and assist.
The organisation is a safe house for the first and only lighthouses of Scotland in Threeve State in Damascus and Malawi, with eight of the 10 lighthouses of Scotland.
State manager David Thompson said the state has a better place for them
He said we have a great place for the lights here in Thrave.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and good births.
But a lot of things about lightbulbs that can't be known yet, so what we're doing here or elsewhere will help us understand what it takes to increase them.
He insisted that the building needs to find out about the lightnings before they start their work, because it is possible that by destroying an ingenuity house, up to 400 mothers and children can be destroyed, possibly a complete local population.
The lights are protected and it is illegal to kill them, threaten them or hurt them, or destroy their homes
The Scotts of the Bet Conservation Trust, officer Alzabith Fair, has encouraged the public to help.
They said: "We know very well what the fire is like, and we do not know what is the state of their dwellings."
Prosecuting the sexual abuse of Ronaldo while prosecuting a German lawyer
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of sexual abuse "a bit of news" and said that people want to use its name.
Her lawyer will be suing Gerede Deer Espagle, who published the charges.
A U.S. woman named Catherine Mae Yorga claimed that in 2009 the Portuguese influence of Ronaldo was rapped by a hotel in Las Vegas.
Dar Espagle reported to the audience that Ronaldo was accused of paying Katherine $375.000 to remain silent about the event.
A few hours after the complaint was reported, using Instagram Live Radio, speaking to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronalds turned down the news as "a bit of news".
He said, "No, no, no, no."
Five times Blonde D.O. said in front of the camera that what they're saying is 'a bit of news'
They want to be known by using my name.
It's a simple thing.
They want to be known by my name, but that's what happens.
smiling, he added, "I'm a nice man and everything's going well."
According to the writers, Ronaldo's prosecutors are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel, whom they have called "unacceptable reports of unpleasant things in the field of singing life".
Counsel Christian Scharts said that Ronaldo "will claim to be going all the way to the damage to his own self, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
It is said that the event took place in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on June 2009.
According to a paper from the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Mae Yorga apparently went back to the square in Rome, where he apparently committed sexual immorality with her.
Mae Yorga claimed that Ronaldo sat on his knees and told him that he was a "99 percent" but he was defeated by "one percent evil"
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations, but that was with mutual consent.
Mae Yorga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her beatings at the hospital, but later she agreed to testify outside the court because she was "feared of retaliatory action" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Twenty - year - old Mee Yorga says she wants to end this conspiracy because she's in a constant state of affairs because of the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo Manchister was leaving the United States, and the Italian club was transferred to Juve, with an agreement of 100 million euros in the summer.
BRITAIN: As British users, we will "feel regret"
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that Britain "will regret us" if he loses his position as a global prisoner in the field of car manufacturing after the visit
He also said, 'It's amazing' that Tuvota Jo told BCC that if Britain comes out of a dealer's U.S. without a deal, it will temporarily stop its production in its factory in near-Brenston.
Mr. Clarke said we need a deal.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that jobs would be affected by the impact of the border delay without the need to visit the Del.
Brenston Plant - built by Auris and Avensis cars on Twitter - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 percent of the remaining European Union was built.
The director-in-chief of Twitter, Marion Cook, said that my point is that if we leave the UK at the end of March, we will have a productive break in our factory.
Other British car manufacturers including Honda, BM Dublin and Jaguar Land Roure have expressed concern about how trade across borders will take place without the agreement.
For example, B.M.D. says that for a month after the visit, Oxford will stop its mine plant.
Officials say that most of the concerns in the form of a deal without a ticket are related to the dangers of China.
Twitter's production line runs on the basis of ‘always traffic’, under which British and U.S. sponsors reach the parties within 37 minutes for drivers on the order.
If March 29 comes out of the UK without a deal, there may be a breach on the border, which may delay or decrease the share of the parties.
The company says that it will not be possible to have more money than one day's internal cost in your twitter share plant, so the product will have to be shut down.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chequeurs project "is prepared to avoid these standards on the border" for the future relations with Trissa Mayo.
We'll have to make a deal. He told the BC Radio 4's Two-Day Program that we want a best deal that will help us cope successfully in the current situation, but take full advantage of this opportunity.
The testimony of other men and women is not only that we will be able to keep China fully successful.
Tuvota was reluctant to tell how long the production would be withheld, but he said that the increase in production would be reduced in the long term and that jobs would eventually be affected.
Peter Susources, who has been working in Burneston for 24 years and is a United Conner at the plant, said that he is very concerned about it: when my experience ends, I never get back.
A government translator said: "We have put forward a proper and fair plan for our future relations with A.O.
White House said it might be delayed again to meet the drum with Rosenstein.
White House told Sunday that the Docket of the Donald Drum with General Rod Rud Rosenstein "can be updated one and a week" while the Supreme Court's written trial is still underway with Judge Brett Kivan.
Russtin is overseeing the work of Special Agent Robert Moeller, who is investigating possible interference in the elections between Russians, Tromp's allies and Russians and investigating possible violations of justice by the governor and the president.
Whether or not the Trump D.A. General will turn this into a threat to the independence of the molar, which has been the subject of a conversation in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Russtin had considered changing the chances of using the drum to record the conversation and removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Russtin had retorted the report.
But last Saturday, he went to the White House despite reports from his staff.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was then held in the United Nations in New York.
Thrup said they would not prefer to take Jean-Stain out, but then the Senate's Jewish Committee was suspended for a meeting to escape from treason, both of which bore witness to Kevin and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse.
Day after day, Thrupe ordered a week's F.B.I. investigation to investigate allegations against Kwana, which led to a further delay in the Senate vote.
Let's come on Sunday at the press secretary Sara Sanders Fox News.
When asked about the meeting of Jean-Stain, he said, "No date is set, it may be the same week, I see with other things in the Supreme Court that it will take a week longer.
But we'll keep an eye on it, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will reject the claim: Sanders hasn't issued a press briefing in White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said, "If the lack of a bridge wasn't due to the hate of the te reporters, I wouldn't really deny that they understood it."
Then he decided to increase the direct connection between the trumpet and the press.
And they said, “The people are more concerned with questions than they were before. We have seen their number.”
And Sanders said, "There will still be a bridge, but if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States the right questions, it's certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying hard to do this, and you've seen us do this in the last few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, he'll take the press briefing.
When you are released from the White House or with open sessions or with a high profile, the drums regularly ask questions when attending a press conference.
The single press conference is very interesting.
This week, the president in New York reported on the possible violation of the rules and the presence of different types of reports.
The Health Secretary wrote to European Union workers about the fear of Brexit in NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary has written a letter of thanks from the country and a letter to the NHS working in Scotland to express the desire to stay after the visit.
Jean Freeman MSP has written a letter when the European Union of Britain has been in the corner for less than six months.
The government of Scotland has demonstrated its determination to meet the demands of the citizens of the European Union, who are already working in advanced public services.
In his letter, the honourable Member wrote: "There are riots between Britain and the European Union in the heat, whose decision is expected to take place in the spring
But the British government is also speeding up preparations to deal with a possible disadvantage.
I know this is a time of great concern for you all.
That's why I want to double the fact that I have a sense of the importance of every role that everyone has.
European Union and remote partners bring much experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve
Scotland, of course, is your home and wants you to stand here."
Christian Abercrombie had to undergo an emergency surgery after the head hit.
The Tiggers line of the state of Tennessee, Becker Crischen Ebercrumbs, hit the head with the Vanderbilt Commodores (Vanderbilt Commodores) every week, and then had to pass the emergency surgery after defeating 27-31.
The state's head coach road red told reporters that it took a while before the hot haft time.
Red said, "He came to one and got lost there."
Trainers and medical officials turned the Ebercrumbs into oxygen before putting them on the striker and taking them back for more.
An official of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nash Well, Tennessee that the Ebercrumb surgery was conducted at the Wender Balt Medical Center.
Harris added, "No details about the type of wound/synthesis currently available" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the wound occurred.
Ebercrumby, who is a junior, is playing with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he made five phone calls last week, which make the total number of his phone calls 18 in the tank.
More stamps will be given to foreign buyers to buy land in Britain
More stamps will be issued on foreign buyers in Britain, where additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tour (Tory) plans.
This action will disable the success of observing the young voices of the carbine drive
Stamp duty will be granted on non-Britain tax-payers
The fixed treasure is expected to provide £120 million a year to help homeless people
Three-year-olds will announce today that they have decided to provide more stamps for the purchase of land in Britain by foreign nationals – which will be used to help homeless people.
This action will be seen as an impact on the success of the campaign to provide a smoother home load and target more workers.
An increase in stamp duet will be granted to individuals and entities who do not pay taxes in Britain, which will be used to promote the government’s campaign against gold.
Surcharge, which is an increase in the current stamp duet, includes high levels that were announced two years ago when buying on other homes and rentals - up to three percent may be available.
The solid treasure hopes that this will bring £120 million a year
About 13 per cent of the new land that is built in London is purchased by non-Britains and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to take steps to buy houses.
Many areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "big cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country
It came only two weeks after the lack of funding from the New Police Stock Exchange in Stamp Dwight so that more young people can buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land and not using it, and expressed his desire to eliminate the shortage of buildings so that they could be rescued from the "lowdown" in Britain.
Mr. Karbyen has announced that he has been working on some of the major reforms, including the controls and the construction of the building blocks.
They want to give the councils more power to build a new house.
Mr. Mae said, "I had said last year that I would dedicate my plans to restoring the British dream -- this life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what we're trying to do to repair the market in broken homes.
Britain will always feed those who want to stay here, work and live free.
However, it can't be as easy for those who don't live in Britain as it is for foreign companies to buy homes like hard-working British citizens.
For many there is nothing but a dream, and beneath it there is a barrier of gold.
Jack Russ: 'My final goal is to manage Scotland'
The owner of Sanderland, Jack Russ, says that their "final goal" is to be the management of Scotland at some stage.
Scott is going through the challenge of revitalizing the 42nd Eastern Club, which is now at least three points from the first position in League Won.
They took St Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister after taking him to the last centenary of St Mirren.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I was given a cup of tea and a bus," Russia told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But Scottland grew up looking at Hampden with her father, and that's what drew me back.
However, it will only happen if I succeed in the club system."
As managing director of Sanderland, the Russians include Duke Advocate, David Moose, Sam Alardes, Martin and Neil, Ray Keen, Gus Pott, and Paulo De Canoe.
Alwa Athletic's previous remarks say that after moving ahead with Barnsley and Ipswich Town, they had no fear of following such famous names in such a large club.
"On this occasion I'll be able to measure my success by saying, 'Can I take this club back to the Prime Minister's League?
They said, "The place is in the Prime League for the construction of this club and its facilities."
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll think of myself here as a success if I can take the club back there."
In Dumberton, like the Institute of Hearts and Hearts, Russia has only been in her monthly career for three years.
Then he saved the Alwa from leaving and helped to restore to third grade, and the next year he saved St. Mary from leaving and included the champions of the title.
And Russia says they feel more comfortable with the careers of Clyde, Hartal Pole, Falcre, St. Mary's and Hamalton Academy.
Recalling the charge of Alwa, he said, "It was a real thief.
I really thought it was best for me to have a mannment than to play."
It seems strange because I played correctly, earned a lot of money and enjoyed a life of high standards.
But playing can be hard.
There are a number of things you need to do on the basis of a week.
As far as mental stress and stress are concerned, I'm still facing them, but I think it's appropriate
I wanted to be a manager forever, and now I'm doing this, as my life has been in my teens, I think it's more comfortable than my whole life.
You can listen to the entire interview sound every Sunday, 30 September radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
One survey found that the best time for drinking is 5:30.
The heat of the winter has increased the sales of low-voltage British peaches, but has also increased the pressure on restaurants.
The figures show that in July sales of Pebez and the Frequent Group saw an increase of 2.7 per cent - but its sales in restaurants decreased to 4.8 per cent.
According to CGA's Business Consultant Peter Martin, who collected the statistics, "In contrast to the expectations of the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom, more time in the World Cup meant that last July was seen in the manner of June, when the sale of the beans increased to 2.8 percent, while the sale of the restaurants was less than that.
In June, 1.8 per cent of the restaurant's business fell further in July.
If compared to the sale of restaurants, where there has been a shortage of restaurant sales, the wine market and markets are still winning.
Eaters were also affected by the sun, but not so much as the restaurant operators were affected.
It seems that people just want to drink outside.
Similarly, the sales of alcohol and alcohol from the same group increased to 6.6 percent this month, while food sales decreased to three percent.
Commenting on the event and the guest performance, Regional Sales Manager Paul Noumun said: "The results have continued to reflect the contempt we have seen since the end of April.
As far as sales are concerned in the external market, the impact of weather and major social or gaming events is the most important element
Despite a drop in sales of 4.8 percent a year, it is no surprise that the restaurant groups are suffering from difficulties and will continue to suffer particularly from price pressure.
It was no longer a bad time for food operators to come in the long heat of the summer, and it would indicate that the more reliable the temperature of August would provide the necessary temporary rest.
In July, the total number of cells and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a decrease in the number of brands in the country.

A child in five has a secret social media account he hides from his parents
A survey shows that five children under the age of 11 have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Javili Insta" pages.
This news has added to the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said that they have a "Marczy" account to show their parents
One in five children -- 11-year-olds -- is making social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the "Jabili Institute" accounts -- a photo sharing site set up by the Institute.
This news has added to the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of the students said that they have a clean "marchy" account to show their parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site secretly, and she found out a young girl who was showing the desire to "enhance her."
A survey of the Head Masters and Head Masters of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of them admit they will keep their private accounts.
HMC's chief Mike Benson said: "It's so disturbing that so many young people are engaged in online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them."
El Doual Escatsch Athletics Board will have "The Voice of the Athletics"
El Doyle has been elected as a member of the Pan Exact to the annual General Meeting of Administrative Affairs in Skatash Athletics.
Duel Scotland has the most beautiful track record in the country, and Field Ethlete and Chairman Ein Bate consider this as a great opportunity for game leaders who want to benefit from extensive international experience in the past decade.
Betty said, "Ely Scotts, British and world-wide athletes have a lot of respect, and we're pretty sure they'll benefit from entering the board for athletes in Scotland."
Dale said, "I'm excited about being the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can help and play a role in guiding the games in Scotland."
The U.S., who won a race of 200 metres and 400 metres with his other four Olympic gold medals in 1996 in Atlanta, and is now a regular BBC player, has been able to walk after a temporary strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I was attacked by the strike today.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it would only take time to tell me whether or not I could be healthy and to what extent.
It was a very patient test, but I've been completely healthy and I've learned again how to walk, and I'm practicing today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The Brist-Pimp's newspaper, which compared mothers to rabbits, has distributed online Aryan
A British pump company's newspaper distributed online Aryan, which compared nursing mothers to dairy cows.
The user technology company Elvi (Elvie) is surprised to launch the launch of the "Scientist Briist Pump" called the "Elevation of the World to Dress Up" to which a music video has been released so that it can be shown the freedom that gives the new pump to the mother.
Four real mothers are dancing on a song in a tree filled with four of their sons and daughters, and they say, "Yes, I do. I wash my milk, but you won't see it at all." And "If you don't see it, it's not the soil, it's my soil."
The song continues: "Get him out, get him out, I'll give him a baby, get him out, get him out, I'll milk the women."
However, the newspaper that was published on the Facebook page has given birth to online harassment.
With 77,000 reviews and thousands of comments, the video has encountered a violent reaction from the supervisors, which often says that it is highlighting the "good effects" of Darryn's factory.
"It's a very bad decision to use the pendulums for this design.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and have to have a baby, except that their children are being taken away from them a few days after birth." One woman wrote.
The Elves Brist pump is sitting right inside the nesting brewers (Elves/husbands)
Another said, "Indeed, the boy and the mother are in distress.
But yes, why don't they use it for a toast to a brist pump for mothers who keep their children with them?"
And someone else said, "The most provocative newspaper."
Others defended the newspaper, one of which admitted that she was "museumed".
"I think it's a sexual attraction.
If I could still have milk, I would have bought it.
The pumping makes me feel like a cow.
The news is kind of crazy, but I've taken it the way it meant it.
One wrote, "This is a mentality."
Another said: "This is a funny newspaper whose aim is to pump the mothers (especially in the workplace or in the toilets) and they look like their own "goats"
It's not about praising or commenting on the ad dury's factory.
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that she was dancing in her breweries.
The rear end of the meeting is based on the notion that many women who pump Brist seem like their own cows.
However, the Elve pump is completely silent, it has no stars, and the Narsing brewers are carefully able to move women, keep their children and pump them out.
In Mother, the partner and ECD Ana Bulren commented: "Evi pump is a revolutionary design that needs a fear and active launch.
We wanted to highlight Briist pumping and all its challenges, while expressing it in a fun and related way, we wanted to raise the wonderful sense of freedom that this new pump would bring.
It's not the first time that Elves has come to the reds.
The mother of two children in the London Fashion Week came to Katwak for designer Marta Jakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children displaced has increased, although the ratio of crossing the monthly border is relatively equal, and this has caused difficulties in keeping children with sponsors, which is the result of the reporting of the earthquake management.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented migrants, and they fear that their ability to claim a child will be compromised by the claim.
This increased the risk in June when the party authorities announced that potential sponsors and members of their tribe would collect their fingerprints and that the immigration of the data would be extradited with the immigration authorities.
A high-provoked Matthew Albins, who has worked on immigration and katimes information last week, testified before Congrass that the agency has arrested people who have been asked to help children with limited hearing.
The Agency then confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"They have about 80 percent of the population residing illegally in the country, whether they are sponsors or members of the family of sponsors, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So, we're going to investigate these people," said Mr. Albace.
According to the refugee workers, governments are introducing new laws to speed up the trial of children, which will require a few of them to be brought to trial within a month rather than 60 days.
The number of these will be presented by video conference call instead of by means of a call to follow legal proceedings before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of liberty will be given D.C.
According to the reports of the recent months of refugee workers and of the system, children are more likely to be concerned or depressed than they will be expected to be able to face violent protests or terrorist attacks.
The lawyer said that these protections are even more common in major markets such as Tournilo, where there is a greater likelihood that children are suffering from problems due to large sizes.
He added that moving a tent stand without giving the children the right time to prepare emotionally or without saying hello to their friends could be a cause of grief that many children have already had to face.
The evening told the Americans, the French and the abandoners to leave immediately.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, outside the Prime Minister, Mr Alamlam also asked to return from the Sami migrants, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Teachers, who also serve as ambassadors and ambassadors, said that foreign armies are illegally on land in the dark, and "they will be defeated according to it."
He told the assembly, "They need to listen immediately without consulting."
The teacher insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in the evening, in which more than 360,000 people have been arrested and millions have been homeless since 2011.
He said that terror groups and "unlawful foreign presence" against both of Damascus will "fight this holy war until we clear all the quiet places from them."
In the evening, there are about 2,000 soldiers, who mainly provide training and advice to shadowy Arabs and armed forces against President Basharalasad.
There are more than 1,000 ground forces in the country that have been destroyed since the war in France
In the case of Sami migrants, the teacher said that the conditions for their return are appropriate, and they accused "other Western countries" of spreading "other logical fear" that makes migrants far away
He said, "We have sought help from the international community and human rights organisations to facilitate the return of migrants."
"They're making a political thing that must be based entirely on humanity."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the construction of the new one in the evening until there is no agreement for the end of the war between the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union.
US travelers say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey has created an opportunity to put more pressure on political winners to set up a buffer in Aledib.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the attack of Russian security forces in the region of three million people.
The teacher insisted, however, that the agreement was "a long time" and that the hope was that it would set the goal of the war effort, including the face-to-face feature of the conflict that would be "completed"
It is hoped that the U.S. Ambassador Staffen De Mastora will hold a meeting of the new committee, which will soon include government and adjournment members, so that the post-war agendas can be created and the elections will be smoothed.
The teacher explained to the committee that the panel's work should be "restricted to a review of current ideas" and refrain from involvement.
Why the drums are going to win another time
In view of this logic, a re-election will take place in the 2020 GNP if the accounts and scandals destroy their presidency ahead of time, as many Liberal supervisors hope.

External money is being lost in the most severe mid-term election for Ivan's race
It is not surprising that the 17th election in Pennsylvania is looking at the impasse of money, thanks to the nine-class closure of the Congolese branch, which brings two new hopes for the same seat.
In recent years, a half-expenditure of the Pitts Borg disaster has been lived by the Pitts Democrats Corlemb, who won another special election in the past summer.
Lemb is another Republican representative of Kath Rothvis, who is still representing the 12th anniversary of the New 17th anniversary of the defeat of old Pennsylvania.
In January of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, maps were redesigned after the decision, which said that the old scrolls had been closed to help the Republics illegally.
In the new 17th round, the party's financial partners, the Democratic Campaign Congregational Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) have waged a financial war between the party's financial partners and the Democratic Campaign Congregational Committee (DCCC).

Panama's president, Juan Carlos Verila, met with warmth in June 2017 and was also in a hotel in Panama, even though his partner had disengaged the tromp organization's meninging team.
In a statement earlier this month, the prosecutor of the Department of State decided to call the US Chief of Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent decisions not to admit Taiwan."
However, punishment was reserved only against El Salvador, which received US$140 million for drug control, progress and economic assistance in 2017.
Punishment, including restrictions on the focus of poverty and targeted financial assistance, could have been painful for the Central American country and its increasing unemployment and murder rates.
As was the case at internal meetings, the North American and Central American governments hosted a high-level conference that focused on wealth and wealth, and was seen as an important step forward in trying to prevent migrants from entering the United States last year.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials explained that they want to make progress in a conference that effectively eliminates any sanctions for El Salvador.
Travelers say that Vice President Mike Pens is being criticized for speaking to the conference in mid-October as a sign of change in the administrative agreements in the assembly.
And three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh message or punishment from the United States.
A White House representative from Genab Bolton refused to comment on the debate, about which three US officials, including two passengers, had been prepared to discuss the internal debate on the condition that the name should be kept secret.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
The authorities have said that Aamah has killed at least 384 people in a violent earthquake and tsunami in the city of Palo, Indonesia, which is expected to increase the death rate.
Help officials from the area of Dong Gala are not allowed any notices from the destruction of the protests, which is located in the north of Paulo and is close to the center of a 7.5-strong earthquake.
In Paulo, more than 16,000 people were interviewed after the storm.
The following are some basic information about the island of Palo and Dong Gala:
Palo Central is the capital of the Solavisi province, located on the west side of the island of Solavisi, and was estimated to have 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and the tsunami arrived, the city was enjoying its 40th anniversary.
Dong Gala Island is located over 300 km (180 km) northwest of Solavis.
Regensi province is an administrative area with a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the Central Slavic region depends mainly on fishing and farming, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The exit is also important in the area, but it is mostly opposite the coastal area of Moiro Ali.
Paulo and Dong Gala have been affected several times in the past 100 years, according to a small agency in Indonesia.
In 1938, Sonami killed nearly 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dong Gala.
In 1996, there was also a tsunami in western Donggal, killing nine people.
Indonesia has a peaceful color of the fire of the earthquake and is regularly affected by earthquakes
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004: On 26 December, Samami set up another Samami in northern Asia, Indonesia, which affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along with the coast of Hindi, half of which were killed in Asia.
2005: An earthquake hit the western coast of the Smitra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the coast of Samatra.
2006: 6.8 A violent earthquake ravaged the most populous island of Indonesia in Java, resulting in a tsunami that later killed about 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Smátra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: One of the islands near the city of Montavo was hit by a 7.5-strong earthquake, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 meters high and a number of villages being destroyed and nearly 300 people killed.
2016: A slight earthquake in Asia led to a disaster in the region, which destroyed and spread fear and horror because people were reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed because of the collapses.
2018: Great earthquakes in the Indian outlying island of Lambok have killed more than 500 people, most of whom were killed in the north.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake, and thousands of people were temporarily frightened.
Sarah’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Former Governor and Vice President of Alaska is accused of assaulting the largest son of Sara Palan.
According to a weekly report by Alsaka State Tropers, 29-year-old Alsaka-related Paulen was arrested for assaulting and resisting domestic violence.
According to the police report, when a prominent woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone away from her.
KTUU has reported that Poland's Mat-Su Pretrial Facility has been remanded and placed under an unsecured $500 bond.
According to the network's report, he came to court every week and when he was questioned, he declared himself "not guilty of any crime".
Paulen has three A-grade injuries, which can be spent for a year in prison and $250,000.
He's also charged with B's fines, which he's sentenced to one day in prison and $2,000 in prison.
Military charges against Paul were not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paulen.
Her mother, Sarah Paulen, called the police to report the alleged attack.
This case is currently before the Alska Weather Court.
In January 2016, he was convicted of domestic assaults, assaults against domestic violence reports, and ill-treatment.
Her boyfriend accused her of stabbing her face.
In 2016, former military groups targeted Sarah Palin as they combined their son's violent attitude with PTSD, which increased after her services in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds Destroyed
On Friday, at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Solavis.
The 7.5 earthquake caused the tsunami, causing thousands of homes to be destroyed.
The system of electricity and entertainment has collapsed and is expected to increase the death rate in the coming days.
The earthquake came near central Solawisi, which is located in the north-east of the Indonesian capital.
The videos that have been created during the earthquake are being circulated on social media
When they came from the Sonami coast, hundreds of people were gathered for the Palo City of Man on the coast.
Vacay Prosiculators in New York City are calling for a death penalty for terrorist attacks in New York City
In New York City, fake prosecutors have demanded the death of a convicted man against Sifolo Seppus who killed eight people by death in New York -- the death penalty is sometimes a severe punishment that has not been heard against a felony crime since 1953 in the state.
The 30-year-old Seppo apparently used a home truck to attack the bicycle rider's path with the west coast of Main Hetton and hit the pedestrians and the bike riders on his way.
In order to seek a death penalty in New York's southern failure, the prosicutors must prove that Seppo has "intendedly" to target eight people and "intendedly" to cause serious physical injuries.
According to the court documents, the punishment for both of these crimes is death.
After weeks of the attack, an Acting Grand Jury committed 22 counts of crimes against Seppo, including 8 counts of organized charges for forced execution, usually used by Acting Prosiculators in criminal proceedings, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
Prosiculators called the attack being carried out "to continue, to think unfairly and to think wrongly" and said that the attack required "a sufficient amount of planning and to keep thinking".
The introduction notes say, "Sifolo Love God Echo Seppoo has hurt, hurt and hurt the family and friends of Diego American English, Nicholas Clouseau, Darren Dreke, Earl Archaeology, Hernández, Hernández, and Alejandro Damin Pagnouch."
Five of the affected were natives from Argentina
A decade has passed since the death penalty was imposed in New York City.
The defendant, Khald Barnes, was punished for killing two drug secretaries, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to life in prison.
Last time in New York, the death penalty was imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ithiel Djanne Burg, a married couple who were made up to spy on the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War and were later sentenced to death.
On 19 June, 1953, the two dinars were killed by the British throne.
According to the court document, Pakistani City Zipo did not express any regret in the coming days and months of the attack.
The police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charges, Sepuvo told the authorities that he had been affected by ISIS videos on his phone to attack.
The police also reported that they had requested the ISIS flag to be displayed in their hospital room.
22 He Set Himself Free on Accusedness
A former public attorney for defense David Patten, representing Seppo, said that "they are really disappointed in the decision to invoke."
He said, "We think that seeking death as punishment for a life in which there is no possibility of ever going to be put to death is a long, painful punishment for everyone."
The Zepo's defence team had previously called for no execution.
The Touri Assembly said that Nigel Fergy should implement the Brexit award.
Nigel Fergey proposed to "move the public army" during a protest at the Tour Conference.
Former U.S. leader said that politicians had to "fight the battle" by European Union opponents - when one of the Three Taverns proposed that he should apply the European Union's own prizes.
Conzroyto Peter Bone, who is sitting on the back seats, told March in Burma that if Fergie were a travel secretary, the British ‘would have left the European Union’.
But there are difficulties in pleasing the Fiez parties on their various agreements, which are being highlighted in a separate protest against the visas in the city against the visas.
And despite the attacks of the Great Barriers, the opponents, and the European Union, they are trying to keep their chess composure project in the right direction.
The allies insisted that despite a strong response, they would try to advance the deal with Germany - and force European Union opponents and employees to choose from their packages and from their "outsourcing".
Genab Bon said that to be released means to be released in the Soli Reil, through which she wants to 'force the Chikers'.
He suggested that Fergi should be involved and that he should be responsible for winnings with Germany.
They said, “If they had been born, they would have left the British Union.”
The Walling Boure Assembly added: ‘I am the patron of the ticket, but we have to force chessers’
Commenting on the European Union's opposition, he said: "We did not fight for world wars to prevail.
We want to make our laws in our country."

Russian Grand Prix: In Team Orders, Leo Hamilton came closer to world honour after defeating Sebastian Vital.
It was clear at the same time that Walter Botz had challenged Leo Amalton to play a major role in the Mercedes Team of Orders Reis.
From the pool, Botz started a good start, and almost got ahead of him while defending his status during the first two rounds and invited Vital to attack his teammates.
Vitel first went to Pitts and sent him to the back of the pack, which was to be decided.
Mercedes then completed the lead and followed the Vitall, but Hamlet went ahead in the race when the fugitive driver was in danger of double-dragging the third angle.
At the time of his 21st anniversary, Max Verstipen started from the back row of the grid and was at the seventh position until the end of the first lip.
Then he moved on to most of the race when he set up his tires to finish immediately and left behind the low props for the fourth position.
She finally arrived in Pitts on the 44th of July, but during the rest of the eight days, she failed to increase her speed when Rikonne won the fourth position.

He said, "The team has done a great job of keeping the first two positions."
These were very bad physical symptoms.
President Donald Trump pointed out on a rally on Sunday that he had not issued a letter from Christine Blossy Ford, who had accused British President Brett Kwana of sexual assault for the Supreme Court.
Speaking to a rally in western Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given to the Ford's Senate Jewish Committee, but rather commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "disposed, deceived and lied."
They said, “What is possible – and what is presented in the past – is that when you see anger, you will see it filled with rage, and you will see people lying.
"When you see what's going on and what's going on and what's going on, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dean Pine Stein, did you make a statement?
Remember the answer... did you spell out the documents -- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't express myself."
Okay, hold on a minute.
He said more about the Senator's opinion, "Did we make a statement... didn't we make a statement?"
Phine Stein was sent by Ford with a letter detailing the charges against Kevin in July, and it unfolded in early September -- but Phine Stein denied that it was from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't tell him his story," said Fien Stein to the committee, according to the Hill report.
"They told me to hide it, and I kept it hidden as they said."
But their refusal was not correct according to the president who commented on it during the weekly rally: "I tell you it was a very bad way.
Perhaps they did not make any excuses, but it was the worst thing I could see."
Defending that three women accused of sexual misconduct, the president proposed that the Democrats' accusations be used for their own benefit.
"They are determined to take back power in any way.
You're looking at their poverty, lack of confidence, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to crack down on for power and control." Mediate reported the president.

Air Traffic Controller gave life to make sure hundreds of people on board are saved from the earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is being praised as a hero who lost his life by making sure that hundreds of people flew out of the country.
On Friday, more than 800 people have been killed in a major earthquake giving birth to Sonami in Solavis, and several have been killed.
The following earthquakes have spread to the area of the strong, and many people are forced to flee to the city of Paulo.
But despite fleeing for the lives of his companions, a 21-year-old Antony Guinness Aggang refused to leave his post at the check-in tower at Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He was there to make sure that the flight was filled with speech 6321, which was then on the Rhine.
Then when he thought the traffic control tower was falling, he slammed out of the tower.
Then he died in the hospital.
Australia's ABC News reported that an Air Innovation Indonesian translator, Johannes Varitt, said his decision has saved hundreds of lives
We prepared a helicopter in Kali Mintan to take him to another city hospital from Blakppan.
Unfortunately, before we get to the Heli Captor's base, we've lost this morning.
He added, "Our hearts are sad about this."
In the same case, the authorities are concerned that the death rate can reach thousands, while the agency for disaster relief says that access to Dong is limited to Gala, Zigi and Botoong.
The agency's translator, Stupou Provo Ningruho, said, "Of course, death is increasing because some people were underage and some could not be reached."
The waves of up to 6 meters have destroyed Paulo, where it will be buried on Sunday.
Ascary and Kamrushle are helping and helping.
Thirty-five-five-year-old mother, Lisa Kechuma told Squay News: "Every minute, Imbolins are taking a dead body.

John Gallind, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told C. Ann: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working hard to help the survivors of the Red Cross, but we don't know what they're going to get there.
There's already been an accident, but it could be worse.
The president of Indonesia, who came to Palo on Saturday, told the country's military: "I tell you all to spend the night in every job with the audience.
Are you ready?" C. Ann's report.
For over a year, an earthquake struck the city of Labok in Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian ship has become a cruise: Air Neugney says that the plane is a missing person after the cruise.
An airline operating in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a person is missing, when it was said earlier by the Airline that all 47 passengers and crew were taken out of the submarine.
Air Newgney said in a relay that until six o'clock in the morning, she's not getting to know a man who's traveling.
Airline said she's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find this man.
Airline has now failed to respond to requests for further details about travel, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the lives of other passengers and crews after trying to land the plane's check-in airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people have been taken to the hospital.
Airline said on the day of the week that she stayed in the hospital for six visits, and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the crisis and the correct situation is unclear.
Airline and the U.S.News, both said that the plane landed a little farther from the Rhine.
Some of the other Witnesses thought the ship had left the Rhine.
The U.S. Traveler Bal Jens said the plane was very low.
Janes said, "This is a very good thing."
Jeans said he and the other passengers were on a submarine through the narrow escape route and in deep water.
He said that the flats were worried and running, and that he also had a slight headache on his head.
The U.S.News said that before about 30 meters (100 ft) of the ship sank into the water, the sailors, who were working to improve the nearby port, were also able to bring people from the water to the shore to help with the work.
The data from the U.S. Secret Network indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in the events of the launch of the PNG Registred Airlines, which did not include Air Newgney.
Analysts have given the time line that night when the woman was burned alive.

The U.S. judge Paul Roulette testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence.
He prepared clay for Jury, how he used cell phone records to collect 29-year-old Cointen Teles, and 19-year-old Chambers to gather his death, moves and aspirations.
Clarion Ledger said that Roulette used a number of cell phones to collect location data showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which is consistent with his previous claims.
When the data showed that he had his phone with Chambers during that time, Chambers said she was with her friend Michael San Ford, so the police went to Saint Ford.
San Ford testified on the day of the week that he wasn't in town that day.
When the caller asked if Telis was telling the truth that he was in the St. Ford truck tonight, St. Ford said, "He's talking a little because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another objection was that Telis said that when Chambers died, he knew him for two weeks.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the death of the Chambers, Teles removed the Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hall said, "He destroyed her from her life."
The lawyer will start his final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said, "They were expecting to see Jury on that day."

Fudges and Commons have seen a recent visit to Britain through a number of artists such as "Fuges" and "Common"
Another black pamper?
Nineny, a New York-related couple, filed a complaint after getting out of work on the message "sendler".
A message from a New York-related Nina mother, who was falsely accused of being "one and black pampering", is being prosecuted after the couple's ethnically expelled.
The couple denied that they were ethnicists and that it was possible that the purpose of the case was to accept "Tavan".
Lance Plasco Felix Man, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment at the arrival of Gizel Maris in 2016 that she was black.
Ms. Plasco Felix Man sent his husband a message, "No, no, no, no.
Instead of sending her husband, however, she sent Mose Maris twice.
According to the New York Post, when she felt her mistake, the "Presson" Plasco Felix Man expelled African nude American Nina Miss Maris, saying she wasn't doing her job properly and expected to be a Filipino.
Ms. Maris was paid one day and then sent home by Uber.
Maris is now on trial for the rape of the couple, and for six months is asking for a reward of up to $350 a day for the job for which they were paid without any agreement.
He told the New York Post on Friday, "I want to show them you can't do that," and he added, "I know it's a racist thing."
The couple objected to the suit and said that getting Marius out of work was a reasonable job because they could not rely on him to make him angry.
"My wife sent him something he didn't mean to say.
He's not a breeder.
We're not ethnic people," Joe Plasco told the New York Post.
But will you assign your children to someone with whom you are fighting, either by mistake or by mistake?
Your first-born child?
Try to understand."
"Tavan" coloring the case, Plasco said that his wife was going to be the mother of the child two months later and "suffered enough of the difficult situation."
Will you follow a man like that?
It's not a thank-you thing," the stockman banker said.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the ruling court is pressuring the couple to hold their hands on the social media and is targeting their attitudes and arguments.
A new letter reveals that the public at Paddington is afraid that the kareen will not find themselves in the desert.
The daughter of Bonde Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to feel somewhere else for the first time to read before it was published.
Now it's so nice to know that Pedestrian's great success was behind him.
Speaking of his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a book about a little naked lake, said that he was pretty hopeful about his book being rejected, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "suffering but sweet" last year after their death.
Paddington, whom he mentioned to be very important to his family," he further said that his father was very proud of his final success.
They said: "He was a man in quietness, and he was not one of those who showed respect.
"But since they had a very real Paddington, it's just like you have a child, and it's a success: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think they saw the success of Paddington something like this.
Although it was their creation and their imagination, they always credited Paddington themselves.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was immediately taken to the 2nd Louis Hospital, where the doctor was able to save her life.
Ms. Ednan Leprosy said, "Need was calling regularly to tell her that she was in a bad condition and she didn't expect to survive."
"Then I was asked to call Ned that she would die in one or two minutes and I'd like to say hello to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashie, I have a lot of love for you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors were gradually losing their influence and getting out of their system to keep her heart pumped.
She died a while ago, and it was all over.
I just had to wait there, knowing that it was all being revealed.
I couldn't cry or drive, I was home with people and family.
I really needed to keep myself steady."
Finally, Ms. Ednan Leprosy, who was killed by his daughter, boarded the ship with other passengers -- who were alienated from the sorrow they were suffering.
He said, "No one knew."
"My head was down, and all the time I was crying with my eyes."
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt very emotional about Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding
I knew how much he loved her."

On Christmas Day he was very sad. When the children opened their presents, he did not see them, nor did he do anything else."
He said, “It was a great shame for them to die, but they have passed by. He creates a barrier in the family.”
It breaks us apart.
But we are bound to do so and to fight against it."

After FBI's investigation, Brit Kivana's future is waving in the middle of the future
He said, speaking on the Sabbath, "I thought we could really do something like this -- a research that's time-consuming -- maybe we could build some unity about it." And he said, "They're afraid of being split up because they're separated."
Why don't you want to investigate from the East Kiwana and their Republican defenses F.B.I.?
It's just a matter of time.
The mid-term elections to be held on November 6 are only five weeks away - if republics lose badly, they will be very weak in efforts to elect their representatives in the country's highest court.
George Dwelou is calling the sensors, and they're trying to build a bridge to support his wife, Ashley, who was the secretary of the lens, who works in the White House.

The violence of the North Koreans has been reduced.
A South Korean lawyer has said that less than seven years ago, the Young have reduced the number of offenders who have gone to South Korea since they came into power.
Park Bewong Seog, referring to South Korea's unification commitment data, said that there were 1,127 displaced persons last year -- the number was 2,706 in 2011.
Genab Park said that between North Korea and China there were the most valuable elements of strong border controls and embargoes.
Pong didn't make any public comments.
A large number of immigrants from North Korea have been brought to South Korea's citizenship
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the war in 1953
Most of China escapes with the longest border with northern Korea, and it is easier to cross the most secure uninterrupted zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas
China portrays migrants as illegal Turks and often returns them with force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have been much better in recent months
At the beginning of this month, the two countries' leaders met in Pong Yang for the prizes, whose goal was to reduce the hunts of the Damad in nuclear weapons.
This meeting took place in June after the historic meeting of American President Trump and Low Jung when they agreed on extensive conditions to clean Korea from nuclear waste.
But on the day of the week, North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Young, has since accused the American bans of decline in progress.
In a speech from the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Genab Rey said, "Without any confidence in the Dark, our national peace will have no confidence, and in such circumstances, there is no way for us to unarm ourselves first."
Nancy Palusy called Brit Kiwana a hunt for "Hihan" and added that she was reluctant to perform services in the Supreme Court.
Ivan's political representative Nancy Polocy called the brand Brit Kwana for the Supreme Court "hunting for life" and said she was temporarily reluctant to perform services in the Supreme Court.
Palosy made this comment during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Estonia, Texas, on a weekly basis.
Palosy responded to the Senate's Jewish committee on Thursday, and said, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does this, they'll call her "heavy."
Kivana emotionally denied the charges that she had assaulted Dr. Christine Blossy Ford when they were both young
At the beginning of his story, Kevin was extremely emotional, and sometimes he talked about his family and high school years and was scared.
He criticised the committee's democratic representatives for openly condemning the accusations made by liberals called "a mock and atrocious attack on the perpetrator," who were angry at the 2016 presidential election of Helri Clinton.
Palusy said he believed that the testimony of Kivana has proved that they cannot perform services in the Supreme Court because it has proved that they are opposed to democracy.
He said, "I think he's been self-inflicted by the way he criticises himself about such stories and the clantens and the democracies."
When Pálosi was asked, "If there's confirmation of Kiwana, and the majority of the Democratic Ivans get it, will they try to accuse her, and they'll take it back on her?"
He said, "I'll say, if he doesn't speak the truth about Congrats or the F.B.I., he's not just a Supreme Court, he's not even in this court where he's still in.
Kivana is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Polisy further stated that they are interested in a possible ruling against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade, because it is considered a staunch judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kevina raised questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
He said, "This is not the time for the soul to be judged and to expect us to say, "Isn't this surprising?"
And the women must be in subjection to him.
This right is almost bitter that the months of anger and anger go by, and she can't get away with it without crying.
My Lady Stein said to me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry."
"I don't think it's normal, do you think?"
He continued, "A woman helped me a lot that was on the ejective agreement somewhere, and he told me that even when they were angry, they cried, but she got a capacity that meant that when they got angry, she started crying, saying to someone she talked to, "Maybe you're crying to me that I'm sorry.
But then I'm angry."
Then she spoke to him.
And I think it's great.
The tears are allowed to be dissipated separately because they are generally mistaken.
There's a good memory of the initial job in a man's overcome office, where I found myself crying with unrelenting anger when a big woman grabbed me from my neck -- a cold-headed manager I was always afraid of -- and he drove me to the treasured forest.
He told me, "Don't let people see you crying."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you (O Muhammad SAW) are in despair, and they rejoice that they have the upper hand over you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congolese woman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at their election meeting.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in a non-marriage war on a ship called the Munich Business, and they left the race, Mr. Schroeder was extremely disappointed and there was no reason why they did not think of fighting the presidential election themselves.
30 years later, he told me with a spell, "It wasn't a thought decision."
"There were already seven other hopes in the race, and the last thing they needed was another hope.
Someone called it "Sino White and Seven Seeds."
Because the meeting was a long time ago and it was a long time ago to collect the funds, so they promised that they wouldn't be in the race until they got $2 million.
It was a broken war.
They found out that some of their defenders who gave men $1,000 would only give them $250.
They were surprised, "Do they think I have a vision?"
When they announced that they would not start a formal meeting, they were concerned about how they felt, how they supported themselves, how the system created so much trouble to collect funds and how to target votes, and how the feelings of sexual thinking affected them.
"You'll think I'm going to be a nervous brackish down."
"You'd think that Clarix was my reporter.
I remember what they would write on my book?
"They're crying?"
How the U.S. and China’s Commercial War Will Benefit China
According to experts, the sound of the doors open to trade between the US and China was very loud, and as the war is not over, the gap between the two countries could benefit China.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first tax ban on large Chinese exporters of solar panels, steel and aluminum for the last year.
A more visible increase was this week when a new terephe that affected the stocks of $200 billion (£150 billion) was lifted and a tax was imposed on nearly half of the US coming from China.
Bjung has responded to it every time that the most recent $60 billion has been allocated from five to ten percent of the U.S. dollar.
China has set the target for the US shot, and the second world's largest economy is not visible at present.
To force America to return means to comply with its demands, but to surrender to the United States in public, Chinese President Ziji will be quite ashamed of the Pang
However, experts still say that China can go well with its brands, the pressure of the U.S. trade war over a long period of time can reduce the dependence of both countries on each other and have positive effects on China.
Centers for New America's Squad, focusing on Asia, with a research-based technology-based science-based science-based science-based science-based science-based science-based science-based science-based science-based technology, say, "It's true that one of the two Americans or China's political solutions can create situations that can create economic problems for both countries, and it's more dangerous than the previous observers didn't believe."
The officials outside say that the evening is 'distant' for migrants to return
The evening said he was ready to return to volunteer and has appealed to the country for new construction over seven years since the long war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Elid Al-Alam said that the country's situation is lagging behind.
They said, "The situation on earth today is more stable and more secure than the one which fights against terror."
The government is rehabilitating areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to bring the situation to an end.
Now there are all situations for volunteering to return to the country, which they had to abandon because of terror and one-sided economic measures that have damaged their homes and their families.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million people left the country after the war began in 2011.
More than six million people live in the country need human assistance
Alalam said that the shadow government would welcome help from the country's new building.
But he insisted that it would not receive assistance or assistance from those countries that supported the rebellion.
