Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president of history.
Diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit of the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected it between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth American president to receive it, although the third one to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid that subject, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts have increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
In the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests will attend.
Obama had from the beginning a more reserved attitude towards the prize.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the accused nature of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice accused the president of the civil society Society of nature defenders of Litoměřice (Sociedad de Defensores de la natureeza Litoměřice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain procedures for granting construction licences and, to withdraw the appeals, demanded the money investors for their own benefit, said the spokesperson for the Litoméríce Alena Romová police.
The president of the Society of Defensors of the nature of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
Currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and containers can be found in villages south of Moravia to separate waste everywhere.
What about Brno?
Here it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say Brno doesn't separate the trash for anything.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the waste separation, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have they ever tried, for example, to put a PET bottle in the center of the appropriate container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in the Moravské naměstí square, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
That Mr Onderka and his companions are not angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the trash.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
Per Vacuum
What's happening is that the containers are far away.
Don't surprise me.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic to the trash.
But I didn't see any red containers near the Kaunicova Street.
Luckily, I found the right place on the beach.
However, the trash was already refilling the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city's hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with official statistics.
According to ECO-COM, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of Jihomoravský kraj.
Paroubek's budget removed money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt nor international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Hacienda Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently borrow a loan for sensitive expenditure, income or sickness subsidies. "This is only supposed to delay the problems for the future, it is to put mines," Janota says.
What is happening is that when money is borrowed, interest must be paid more and more, and one day the money must be returned.
The State does not have many options to make money.
If it does not reduce the social subsidies or operating costs of the State, taxes must be increased.
To all who added the left now: the bombers, teachers, farmers.
And later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they'll get them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year there will not be only 163 billion in the treasure, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will continue to increase alongside the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity subsidies, as the government has done in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money in favour of some groups of voters, the next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of motorways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been concluded and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The maximum you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Karel Hanzelka Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD proposed a salmonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mainly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bag with no funds.
Last year, ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year, dividends are wound up with environmental damage, they serve to complete the income account or they serve as a reserve for the planned income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit at 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for the cost of disputes, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, to give up the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Statení połodna project (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been started. It must allow the online monitoring of the expenditure of the various authorities.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Agriculture does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone can operate with two operating systems
The US will have a mobile phone in which the user can switch between several operating systems by pressing a key.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just pressing one key, they switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This possibility is precisely the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing the virtualizer software for computers.
In your mobile you can have two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti told VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and it was shown for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in its grip.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to perform smartphone virtualization tests and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotelers
Not only do telesquies in Krkonoshe worry about snow-free tracks.
The lack of snow makes people not reserve ski resorts in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, free rooms can still be obtained in Krkonoshe for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but still fear to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or mud," said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
Hotels in Špindlerův Mlýn offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon surrender and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he loved Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what matters most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That's why we've been preparing some Christmas stays lately," Ingtours Petr Schiefert said.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will also be exhausted," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's rooms are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about 60 percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in the stays in Krkonoshe will certainly increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the hotel manager Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotelers in Krkonoshe will be given the hope of snow.
Thursday must fall the temperatures and, if there are precipitation, the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakubský de Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
U.S.: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, which he looked forward to, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the phrase "equal to Iraq" used several times, but it also did not empty out on using the title of the January 2007 Bush Declaration for its own statement: "A new path forward".
He himself, who three years ago criticised Bush's idea of sending new military forces to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticised him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is nothing about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the General Afghan operation Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinated relations, subjected the indecisive firefighters in the White House to a severe criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president emptied for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing the Afghan troops in 18 months and to end this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions from the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq ' s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin. After him will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
During the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and it is now about to collapse.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that soldiers sent to war to "come home soon", will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of US defeat.
NATO's latest summit demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which is capable of affecting the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the United States will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal from the Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that there are three years left for the presidential elections and that is why there is still much time left to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
Bank directors Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the U.S. Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn in the event of excessive risks.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way she should take, mentioned the former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after almost $17 billion (almost CZK 30 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite today's announcement, $2 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record at once, with a tax of 50 percent, the bonuses for banks that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all the least Physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, today received the Nobel Prizes from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden in Stockholm this year in specialized categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in Chemicals received it by Israeli Ada Jonath and American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomas.
The last award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was received by US Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for an analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each prize collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several prizes in each category, the prize is distributed among themselves.
The traditionally hoped Nobel Peace one received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy of having been rewarded, since it was at the beginning of his career and was also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that, in certain situations, wars were essential to achieving peace, although their price was high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited you to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to the Minister of Agriculture Eduard Janota, who is calling for his stay in the government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is expected that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the subject of her meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the occasion, President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the meeting.
About his stay in office, Janato wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Members, however, adopted on Wednesday the proposals on the left for transfers of funds and increased the money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the social democrats, as they cover the increase in the budget deficit.
Between the left-hand side and the government, Klaus and the right-hand side, there was a serious domestic policy conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucrat office began to be controversial, which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version adopted by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; he said today during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been waiting for "the serious problem", that is, "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public farm.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is awesome and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice President of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucrat office with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words of "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek saying the budget deficit is awesome, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday, ČSSD said that the adoption of the State budget for the coming year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play them by American actors.
The story talks about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American player winning an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to play in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I will have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world boxing of the Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to join his people through sports, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to the outside world.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role so that it would be as much as possible as the reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be among the builders before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to tighten Mandela's hand.
I found out that when I hold your hand, I get your energy, it transmits itself, and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot taller in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and ambitions for Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of the Splendor About Norway Solved: The Russians Tested a Missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence concluded yesterday by recognizing that near the border with Norway it had tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write about "Bulvá" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again on the device.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulvá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated since the first moment to make it a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two phases of the missile were sustained and it would have occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines were immediately reported in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely smoothly, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence, only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of nearly 50 percent full of optimism to the generals, and therefore they continue to say that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow's CSKA at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will again introduce himself at 51 years of age to a professional hockey meeting.
The world's former champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team Cska Moscow and possibly play on Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov completed his career at the age of forty in 1998 and is currently chairing the Cska.
After Denis Kulyash was wounded, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov keeps practicing and has committed himself to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to one party.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, it will become the longest professional player in the Russian hockey.
Legendary front Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one years, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympic gold, seven world championships, won the Cup of Canada and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also succeeded in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hall of Hockey Glory.
Hyundai met the union requirements. He'll cancel all the extra work
The direction of the car factory in Noshovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely due to the frequent additional work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
For this year, however, the management wants to agree with the unions one more Saturday tour.
We cannot give up our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, i.e. it will work in two shifts," Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanjka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend Christmas holidays in one day, said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees on Saturday's shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, yesterday afternoon management decided to cancel immediately all the supplementary work for December, Vaněk mentioned.
The car factory employees were forced to work two hours in addition to eight hours of shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between factory management and trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kucharæ trade unions said on Wednesday that if they were committed to meeting the requirements and signed the document, they were prepared to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously entered the strike for the frequent additional work.
They also protested against the poor conditions of payment and the alleged harassment.
The management considered that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The unionists in their statement of the emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, last Wednesday, interrupted the manufacture, be penalized in any way.
As far as additional work is concerned, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year a salary of 5,000 crowns is required for this work.
The car factory in Noshovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacturing started last November.
Until last September he made about 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'uncultivated' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderateing the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged by a combination of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely eliminated, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the medicines will no longer work.
The work of the experts from the three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg shows the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarbons have an effect on the albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the medicines used today, so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
The metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedron cells composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are bound by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no HIV fractionation and no mature and infectious body cells of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are combined by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in test, and also against their resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metalocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of the medicines clinically used, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes metalocarbons interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézačová, head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "frequent" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for the analysis.
The Vice President of ODS Petr Neczas said that the concept of the bureaucrat with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to support the minority, who is trying to combat the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Members yesterday approved the 2010 budget, but with the amendments to the left by more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has denounced ODS proposals, as they cover the increase in the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS came out of the room before the vote, thus fulfilling the Government's wish, that the modified budget was better than a provisional budget.
Dissolved and useless
Hacienda Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feelings of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Czech TV Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is his disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government, they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, which imposed the budgetary changes.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear, if he resigns, whether the House adopts other laws which increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, pensions, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS have no blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text message.
He recalled that there were people in various ministries in the position of lieutenants who belonged to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public farm, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it cannot rely on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about it, at the moment, I will take care of it, told journalists in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister for Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by ODS members.
Prime Minister Fischer came out in the afternoon to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS submitted to Prime Minister's request
Nejas stressed that ODS would probably vote against the modified budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the party leader in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
He didn't realize that my vote was missing.
When he gave up his mandate, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolsheviks of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive things, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of ČD trains, less trains will run at almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) will from 13 December cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total length of the traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More links to the capital will, for example, be won by the residents of the Ostravsko region, and the drags for this line will add a hanging career.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circle back to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in road transport is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and around.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice track and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will only be reduced to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nadraži station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will not travel again to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive the year that comes four billion kroner in total, as this year. The local trains are charged by the regions, the year that comes will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains, the train has a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been one year.
Drahy is happy with the system, and perhaps that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will only take place on one day's tickets - ČD Net and on eLiška's cheap internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the only price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to arrest more than 50 people, children are released
The armed men have now kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
That is what the AFP agency said, which previously reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is said that approximately 19 armed men are using hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, armed men belong to the New Popular Armed Forces (NPA), an armed group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police had previously prosecuted the kidnappers for violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was due to the recent murder, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 murder, about the governor's election, there were 30 journalists.
Suspecting the involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province was arrested in southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
In Mindanao Island, Muslim separatists also operate.
However, they renewed the peace dialogue with the Filipino government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film from Clint Eastwood Invictus (her official Czech title isInvictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the leading role of Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the outside born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa during 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at that time, when preparations are under way for the world football championship in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new movie in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by Hollywood's "low-interest" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
I often found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as it is said - collect his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festive outdoor in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the film.
It is a story from the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
On the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Retreats the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of residents, racially and for many years apart. Just as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist also puts the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the World Cup at that time.
To get into the grill on the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, 14 years ago Mandela won great ovations, especially the white public and the recognition of white people.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview with LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Lounsko he burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesperson for the bombers in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firemen wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their minds and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the voice of the company, which would not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandate, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity, nothing like this happened, the commodities of this kind are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the ČEZ society for northern Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of the electric substation does not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps was established in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of electric power of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jancura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetmans of ČSSD
The owner of Student Agency Radim Janchura today will present a complaint for slander to three Social Democratic Hetmans.
This is the case of Michal Hasek de la region of South Morabský kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubíský kraj y el hetman de Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesarík.
Jancura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radio Journal.
The demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Republic.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taken pasta", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České Drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České Drahy, which were fixed last week.
So there's nothing left to defend us.
It's because of the slander to the Student Agency, he told Janchura Radiojournal.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, which he did not consider necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hasek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Janchura's medial show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose that, on this occasion too, it will be clear that Mr Janchura manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, hashek said.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiojournal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jancura started the campaign after the regions agreed with the Czech Drahy to maintain regional railway links and for the task of approximately 150 billion crowns they did not call a tender.
According to Jancura, similar steps are in conflict with the law and the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of the ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave it, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I know what you are talking about, I am not going to say his name, Janchura said to Radiojournal today.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free of charge and free of charge
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end the usual habits.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already appeared that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting maximum vaccine prices, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also aware of this in the immunization procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January you can receive free of charge the pneumococcal vaccine for children born from 2 August last year.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or before must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and the fifth months of the child.
Last year, the fourth of the families voluntarily had their children immunized against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of young children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccines.
They will save no breast-feeding in treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500 000 per year on the whole vaccination of children.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of mean otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumonia infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die from hospital research.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, there are views at the same time that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Your association has been spreading the pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we need to start now, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeněn.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say.
La presidenta de la society de padiatras The professional association of practical child doctors Hana Cabrnoch's recognition, which la vacuna vololaria tends sus disadvantageas.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, it might be reasonable to consider reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a voluntary one," said Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from the year that comes more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on in treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as well as when the state gave them other vaccines.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
Paediatrics are expected to invest 40 thousand per month in vaccines, which is a notable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames in his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute could have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told the police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said Frazetta father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended increases in taxes and cuts in expenditure in the previous report to the budget, in view of the criticism of the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "explosed" an opportunity to show its seriousness about the cut-off of the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received severe criticism for damaging low- and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5 per cent increase in social security expenditure and a 1 per cent peak in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Anger for Social Security
The unions have regretted that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FRAMEWORK POINTS OF PRESENT REPORT TO THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 per cent increase from April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
1 point of corporate tax for small firms was rejected
Tax write-offs for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will earn £110.
Ministers said their goal of reducing the deficit by half for 2013 was "hard decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be higher than 5% of the higher wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax increases and expenditure cuts outlined were a "grape of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party ' s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be paid and the rate at which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was obliged to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract in 4.75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3.5% predicted in April, while the loan application would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Exposed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour Party's "debt crisis", said that the loan application project for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, adding, "cynically", the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater reduction of the deficit in the short term.
But the liberal Democrats claimed that the money collected by tax increases and expenditure cuts would be used to support the next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "arena castles".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the timing of the announcements, such as the increase in the inflation of some subsidies due to the incapacity of the next April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to allegations of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really delaying the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are aware of this."
The FBI is investigating "US arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy of Pakistan told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A., last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egypt's inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the posts they have been arrested for and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," the spokesman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said that the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said that the house was already on the look of the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the detainees.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, informed the Reuters news agency; but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "absorbing"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been the same as disabled, according to a report from the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Twelve people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Jamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-scientific.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there were abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was detained in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the abuse of post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski trail was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was rather frightening.
It is seen under a beautiful view of the city's lights titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Lao State.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on the construction of mines and where there is a generalized warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's last work "Why the French don't like sails" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide to the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a municipality (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a bank system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These are seemingly worldly issues, it maintains, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of their reputation, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot spread this argument completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen's interview tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, the supporters of Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategies (and the intellectual elite who so ferociously defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most devastating panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with you life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of the whale hunt, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old cadette, fighting only with the end of his mosque, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The children, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly extinct mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even now, zoos are still generally a millionth part of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore is greened by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its hair.

Ellis uses reports from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorcyclists use high-power assault rifles to drop their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about the science of the Arctic and an overtaking view of how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
It's not because of a lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer journeys at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century gave indications for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the cold war drew up a map of the moving ice cords that flow below the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the influxing system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater humps that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the ice of the summer is removed, which is thought to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that place crowns in the graves of Arlington
Pfc. De'Angelo Robinson, 19, spent seven hours on a bus to put one crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where they're shipping us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who met on Saturday morning to place crowns in the graves of the veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Crowns Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year to different cities along the way to organize events dedicated to soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the cemetery of Arlington, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a dead military career.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Surrounded by warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the broad meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed for the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and Vietnam's war, because they don't receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hand, while they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bond attached to the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the shadow atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice-cream.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the wet rock, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed the tears of her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the Sgto marine artillery. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Many times after my death, I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who distributed mobiles and laptops in the country, officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on client projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific posts have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "hazardous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an initial blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept awards on several occasions, but he has been denied permission.
A U.S. contractor's arrest may probably create tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to get the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and expensive products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the United States Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the US citizens' fists in the Cuban prison are amongst crimes gangs such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly unclear.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as free mobile distribution, is a crime in Cuba, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Watch program, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the very Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He showed that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often caused a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials disarm a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, expressing their hope that the case could help to unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet to search for radicalized young people.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah led men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for the Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of the Qaeda that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicateness of the case.
The officer said that the men had not been immutable and were even trying to obtain adequate approval to access the Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani police.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determines who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. intelligence has given priority to trying to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that the Qaeda analyzes with special attention the aspirations of American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to U.S. goals and because of their value of advertising.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those they admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model than so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched down the streets demanding negotiators working at the City's Bella Center Convention Centre, more bold climate action.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On one day when it was not long before the talks on the UN-sponsored climate, thousands of activists walked through the city holding English banners saying "There is no B planet" and one in Spanish saying, "The Earth says "that's enough".
Several famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's travels, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing things that the country has to deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he has expressed.
This is not an easy task, but if you have to do, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or the wearing of pocket knives.
Under the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black actors placed several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were in the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as callers, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, a Chinese climate chief negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English, "I really wasn't at all in the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said that this showed public attention in general and from different sectors to the topic of climate change.
On the other hand, "the negotiations, or the freedom of other people, can also be said to affect them.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal qualification book last week on mathematical performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country ' s best performance systems, the Qualifications Book has shown that fourth and eighth grade students have been at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Education Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average scores of the fourth grade white students in the D.C. over the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (in a 500-scale scale), but their Afro-American couples increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The mean white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
During a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was introduced in the District, was 60 points from scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the progress made by Director Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by addressing those on the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflictful, Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates education equity in the District.
I am not giving leaps of joy for a difference of two or three points, said the member of the D.C. Council, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, a critical assiduous of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns us is that we are not spending the time and energy needed for our secondary schools.
Rhee said that the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, is being trained by some teachers to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the upper and middle levels of primary and secondary school, who did not dominate the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a math curriculum from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes real life games and experiences, which was introduced into the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, whom he is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think that we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that ENPE results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of scab dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban evidence scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts that go against that important chronogram.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban supervisors, she is trying to cling to the medium white and black class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our district schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now overseer of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with independent schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considered to be an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, came down and perched for a moment in front of white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the record costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of potential students.
Yes! That's where I'll be! said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers-students at school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited in their three-day journey, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you will go to university.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or get pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated from college, a notable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with US schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university, especially if efforts are made over time.
Noting low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is concluded that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the children's garden to the secondary school.
The federal program that funded the rotation of Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to implement university preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in high school and continue until high school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about political violence and instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies have moved up and down in just two of the 10 stocks.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer was lost.
Two US companies reached agreements for stocks under way in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news centre.
It will take a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military withdraws, probably prevented US oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third largest oil reserve, said analysts.
In some cases US companies were disadvantaged, because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only US companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have narrowed ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese State, offered more contracts than any other company and made major investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is about to become a major economic and technological power, expressed the spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the side of its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each deposit.
The main planner of al Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan has killed a major operations planner in Qaeda this week, US counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who was thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car got the impact, a civilian intelligence agency official from Pakistan said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner of the Qaeda, who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy all over the world, said a high official, who spoke from the anonymity, quoting the delicate nature of US air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to the top of the Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had risen quickly in the ranks of the Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of unmanned aircraft attacks conducted by the CIA has decreased since summer, from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to a report from The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved approach by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while killing suspicious informants desperately, the site said.
UN maximum mission to Kabul to give up
The highest United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with a turbulent mandate that was damaged by widespread corruption charges in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
The exit of Eide occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which began in 18 months, encouraged other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide pointed out in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who were working with the political transition from Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously conducted UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that Galbraith's charges, who was fired, "surely damaged the mission, because there was already much scepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also encouraged the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which are lent to the Afghan mission, and to say that this would increase its confidence that their money was being properly used.
Eide expressed her frustration at the limitations on her powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the harsh United Nations procurement regulations were undermining her ability to capture talent.
That is how UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, due to its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, I supported, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions directed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and incentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable consequences" if its nuclear programme does not fully comply with the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear programme and accept leaving a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have withdrawn from the attempt agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's strengthening with the international community on some of the proposals actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before replanting other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "depravating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations reported what it called Thursday “unfounded and lacking basic” by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it had the will to continue with talks with the United States and other five world powers, “in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich Iraq region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions continue between the Kurds and the majority of Iraq's Arab people, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by advertisements that preached them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means another grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang, aged 31, said a human resource manager with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notoriously resonated children, single children who are malnourished, affected by "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when policy became effective, according to the Division.
The United Nations population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to operate from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050, is much higher than the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultural populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more accounted for almost 22 per cent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Committee on Family Planning and Municipal Population, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly population and alleviate a future shortage of work."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single son of China is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have undermined the policy by their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually abandoned their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 many of their hardline slogans weakened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who it would be appropriate to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city's government sent family and volunteer planning officials to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disturbing Response
Although officials from a rural city outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in requests from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts did not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want children anymore.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient medical and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they maintain, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly see the single-child policy as a question of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, we're stealing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a single son because she was also the one who was: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to caring for others and we really don't want to care for others."
Chen Zijian, 42-year-old owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For parents with two middle-class races, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is a success enough to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years of age grew up seeing their parents struggle during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child takes a lot of time from parents, I supported.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategy "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best custody when the child has 9 months."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group is drawing up a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been characterized by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, renewed focus on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global short- and long-term warming.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate officer, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by between 25 and 45 per cent by 2020, compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated talks Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and drought to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated the conversations last week.
The United States Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared with those of the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States will not enter into an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text had not done enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the United States' highest climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, failure lines have erupted both within the world in the course of development, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should cost the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in order to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate said, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change from Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that the talks would produce a political agreement at best.
The Small Island States Alliance, with 43 members, developed a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and require the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to an end.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to limit the calls that will be held next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people every day enter and leave the convention centre, the guitar activists present night shows jokingly from the countries they say they are selling, and preliminary proposals are being made by hand rather than by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the Global Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first 225 km train from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 p.m. on Monday morning, a silvery will penetrate the darkness to mark a train exit that marks a revolution for trips to Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km, when it passes as a ray from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin Interurban Service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would turn into suburban prosperity, business travel times would be cut short and the changing of aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage, can still slow down the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be traced within a five-metre radio in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be traced within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will establish three options for a wider high-speed network to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a configuration in the form of Y, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninnahs to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a railway member.
Once finished, the travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stop, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, converting the British network to Europe's fastest.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 m long trains capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to adapt to the high-speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that the scheme should take place, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is going on, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines by the existing carriages to the north of Birmingham, keeping the travel times between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Contributors face the mortgage by an orange of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservative Party, paid the contributor thousands of pounds a year at the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs were living "rations", increased their mortgage by £75,000 to build a slave-framed extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the contributor to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the costs of the members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that the applications could not be clearer or simpler.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of honoraries agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "narangal".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its earlier mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee dismissed him from violating the rules after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of his property from London to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interests until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The type of interest of the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr. Duncan did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage type of BRE fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007, to 4 per cent in March of this year, to the one it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the opposition of the House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the MPs had to survive "reasons" after the cost scandal.
"This is basically nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could be considered "excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol of the sterling pound on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he applied for 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not about avoiding and delinquency or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler in any way."
Let those who have faith come, to see the calendar of the Adventure of Brighton Beach
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for every December day, using villanics as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full pastels and free servings.
The villas selected so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palate presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-remunerated minister of the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palapa's event calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday on the pretext of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police held several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, had shown up for the frozen Danish capital in an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization of climate worldwide, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the very high "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke loose with adoquins and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturb police intervene quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, particularly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups who had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April last year.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them were "immobilized on the street on Saturday night married and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peacefully, came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a watch with candles.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train in the large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial gullies responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on saying: there's time, he said, "Angélique Kidjo's benign singer."
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming does not oppose the fight for another world".
The Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial summit to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went out on the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red clothes and lit panels with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of demonstrators were formed, demanding that they act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a prorrusse separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the heads of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili said, "I regret that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," Manana Manjgaladzé said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a phase of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the electorate who addressed the electoral table in a school of capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees in the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with scenic landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the West of the country, the district chief Beslan Archba warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow's support, and in particular the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that his country is quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, answered by raising his vodka glass.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia the control of low rails for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more than one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out on the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which accommodated delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
Protesters stopped at about 500 metres from the center without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a watch with candles.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all black clothes, broke loose with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturb police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, stating that it was mainly members of the Black Blocks, ultraviolent groups that had already acted at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandibula with an admiral, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We did not remove the eyes of the extremist groups from above, preventing police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen from flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived on the bus and train from the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial gullies responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming does not oppose the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization along with the former UN refugee commissioner, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial summit to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people went out on the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dress and shining banners in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine Capital Council.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The assignment of history and geography is strengthened from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast in the Informative on Sunday (JDD, according to his French seal) that history and geography would emerge "fortalecid" from the reform of general secondary education, although it would be eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelorhood.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor's degree will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "just with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, summons the best students".
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be subbramas of the C, it goes on to say: "I have not heard that historians or intellectuals were angry that they had eliminated history and geography in the second of a bachillerate in technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate mandatory history-geography teaching in second degree C. Many intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected right representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "not spoken" to eliminate the philosophy of second-grade B.C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which, according to them, sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will deliver an admission test aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real terms during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, i.e., more than 300 hours added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the Standard Higher School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain climate developments convincingly
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, I challenge you to accept on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the conference wheel "Ernest", a day composed of a series of presentations by 15 minutes experts, filmed and open to the public, informed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and convey them the desire to know more, explained in the context of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics against about 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public would understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website as of 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust between prison guards, action is planned
The prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year's holidays, the premiums and extra hours, which was postponed until budgetary reasons were energized.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd Guard Union) asked staff outside the service to join the event on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to report the theft of their property.
The penitentiary CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "congregate in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", since it makes the failure to comply with the "extra hours, nights, Sundays and festive days" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensured that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard trade unions ensuring that payment would be made next month.
No doubt about the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours did not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the management staff who enjoys the benefit of the famous awards for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements," said Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott up to a new order "all meetings and calls".
The staff will not come to work on the respective Sundays and holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, and also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking on more effective tasks, it is more than regrettable to hesitate to strike staff salary, she appreciates the Burdeos penitentiary CGT.
According to the unions, not in all regions the same happens, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forgett.
For Christmas, Obama says it makes "better gifts" than those who receive
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television performer, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than those I receive".
During a special interview that the ABC chain will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the holidays at the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the small companion of four legs of the family, will be part of the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the results of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," he said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding with humor pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in an atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite children's gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him Christmas gifts.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Only many years later, I realized that he had given me that balloon.
For his part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, I loved that doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operationed, RTL says he's in a induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its adherents, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old Rocker was again intervened from Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital where some doctors checked "derivative lesions" from the disc hernia surgery carried out in Paris on November 26th, pointing out his press service in that same city, indicating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be reported within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be subjected to a coma induced to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we'll have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" he would not have been introduced any channel after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, programmed a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information provided by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital on Monday for an infection resulting from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddie Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but he made sure there was no "no problem" because the rocker was "a fighter".
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a stupid thing to do twelve hours after such surgery, it's not possible, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to calm down saying that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the wife of the musician, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed to have been operated with a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "turn 66", presented as his turn of farewell.
But since then, every health problem has been reported excessively. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
In mid-November, their adherents even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet at your favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-way medalist in the World's 2009 long swimming pool, obtained an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short swimming pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A punishment for Bousquet, who yearned for the record of the world in 50 m free, marks that he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming distances, 50 m free, the French 28-year-old was imposed with 20''53 during a finish where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international premium.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but did not achieve the world brand (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane baths that will be banned from 1 January.
These swimmers, which originated from 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epopey in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathrooms did not help German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not reach his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A Zola-owned sarcophagus panel sold at USD 1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, far above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's artist.
This two-metre panel of 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework surrounded by satires and drunken women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five," explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most elevated by the buyers, undoubtedly, pointed out to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Aberenthy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bath in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time before the Marshal Petin took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts was uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico believed that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the overthrowed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coupist government denied the safe conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the move, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take it to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
To give him a safe conduit, the coup government wanted Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the guest head of state.
The coupist government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my position ..., they wanted to present my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday to Radio Globe, where he often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, I added by playing some accords the deposed president, who has been refugees in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy submitted a request for a safe conduit, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, the Minister of Interior of the coup d'état, Oscar Raúl Matute, said on Wednesday on the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the Honduras people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's match mobilized on Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who met around the Embassy of Brazil, strongly located by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup d'état government.
This reflects the marginal nature of this government in relation to international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was abolished on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his reelection, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he came back in surprise on September 21 and took refuge in the Embassy of Brazil.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Court for the crime of "high treason" according to the coup d'état.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, reached a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. That election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until its mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq won 0.33%.
According to the final figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index went up 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piezza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he explained, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October with respect to September, to $32,90 billion.
The analysts were, on the contrary, expecting a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
Great innovation is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com, commented.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "was the lowest since a year ago", stressed Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus performance rose to 3,482 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus to 4,492 per cent on the evening.
Cuba: More than a hundred power supporters appeal to the "White Lady"
This Thursday hundreds of Cuban power supporters hugged the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Lamas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, a journalist from the AFP said.
They die the Yanks!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" they sent their fists up the militants of power to dissidents.
The latter were heard by civil-dressed agents who came to protect them.
In the evening, a similar demonstration was launched against the "White Lady" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day, were arrested by civilian police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were dragged by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded with the Sajarov 2005 Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "seek the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissidentity, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom follow the lines.
The Cuban authorities bribe the opponents of "merceners" or "agents" in return for their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration on Thursday of government militants against the "counter-revolutionary" ones.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of treading rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An ingenious killer to an octogenary with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (High Sena) on Thursday at the time of the afternoon's peak
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of it in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaures Boulevard, reported police and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a member of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, was interned and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the seemingly affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a demise and was hospitalized "in a state of shock", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped from the tower of Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a 30-year-old man, and a 40-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying crusaders on his back, a union officer at the Seine Highs, Arnaud Pressé, explained.
A number of transitions, including young people, tried to control the drain, according to the evidence obtained by the AFP.
I've seen a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't do it because the guy was strong, explains Alberto, a mayor of a nearby bar.
A crowd was thrown over him, including a police officer who broke the dome, added.
At the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded by fists, according to the police witnesses.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted an investigation into the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of the Senate (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
There is no such word during his interim detention.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him in the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all concerned of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the influence of the action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
The French-Polish film lawyer Roman Polanski once again complained this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), who rejected the case against his client, who was under house arrest in Switzerland, for a sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer from the director of "El Pianista", complained to three judges of the Appeals Chamber of the Second District of California of serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at this very moment the charges are dismissed, since the judge's conduct in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was a hotshot".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (lost since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before passing a sentence, which was a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the holding of a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejected the rejection of the case.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of any depreciation of the charges as long as Roman Polanski was not brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled from the United States in 1978 before his sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor under 13.
Since then, he has never walked the United States again.
Los Angeles District Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear in the audience."
For this reason, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?, asked Asayama.
To her, the filmmaker "requests a favor to the court, even though he despises his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to disclaim the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports her every time the Polanski case comes up, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of a U.S. arrest.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and is stopped by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday without any direction, in a market that deals with better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached 65.67 points reaching 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located at 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management pointed out.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasing and I think it will be maintained until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation", analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers was recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes were stalled by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "refers to sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus performance rose to 3.540 per cent against 3.482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus to 4.497 per cent against 4.492 per cent on evening.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportist or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revue.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I have seen many things and I have lived countless experiences!, said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This nine-time event in South Africa will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand to the North of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very glad I've lavified twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African lands that take away the breath".
After a month of gala, tests, press wheels and safaris, the candidates to Miss World focus on the race.
India Poja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of every woman is to be crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dress and, of course, with a bath.
The Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former queen of South African beauty, Michelle McLean, and a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World race.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who stretched out his hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly be the city of Cape Town (Southwest) lottery for the World of Football of June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I never thought to get to know.
She's probably back for the World 2010, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", David assured his son on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, told the press David Hallyday on his way down from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. (21 p.m.G.T.).
The singer's son, distended, assured him that he would move "as far as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital, where he entered Monday for an infection, followed by a discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended to attend a school act, confirmed a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitie-Salpätrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26th at the international private clinic in Parque Monceau, Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice with disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have gone "no channel, no nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated the actress Marie Tritignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, he also spoke to actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed by a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by ill-practices, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without a scruples" "on a regular basis" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke through his lawyer David Koubbi on Friday.
It indicated that the intervention "was performed without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's turn, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
No doubt to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, said Camus.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its seal
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the seal of the former giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, his punishment for being claimed.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, since he believed that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy to the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
In support of his management, he received the help of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the MP, urging them to give up the seal and transfer the rights of the brand's property, their judicial penalty.
In these last days, you have made many statements indicating that you were going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF seal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan + the UDF d'aujourdhui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, they support the signatories of the letter.
As you already know, you have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any support, as well as of (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate right-holders".
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has no right, according to them, to use the UDF seal.
They also recall that the last UDF convention voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continues the office, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but a member of the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently taking advantage of the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to carry it out on its behalf.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they complain, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of the anonymity by taking a name that you are not entitled to."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to trial artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as said by the daughter of the multi-millionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expose her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star pictures of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence is a maximum sentence of three years in prison and EUR 375,000 in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the returns of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's principal shareholder and shareholder always refused to submit to such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they should state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll accept it.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said when she left the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The survey will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older woman, whom we must protect, said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain billions of euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered to be a long-term friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations sometimes resulted in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was mistrusting Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, so much more than a guardianial judge refused, in these last days, to take place at his request to open a court-martial procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guard and has no guardian.
No one else can appear in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Finally, the court decided that the judgement on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered once.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was earlier to impose on consumers products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that do not relate to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end in mortal demortification.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially R+D and, more importantly, business intelligence.
Indeed, the IB (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to have proactive conduct and perspective" ; it requires employees to make a commitment that completely opposes the recommendations of an authority.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as much as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the directors have a simple view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the former behaviorist theory that the American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have widely spread to their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directors in a mechanicalist management position, not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution needed for the good functioning of modern companies is to adopt a final view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of making reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default dock that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and replace the management of human resources "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable ground for organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: by the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the right American, is satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the Vice-Presidentship during the 2008 elections.
I loved what you said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the subject of the war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my view, war is, from time to time, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists, he noticed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, and the former President of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For the moment, the speech seemed very historical to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a potential candidate for republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that "they would not be free and could not give a prize of peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler at Washington Post, Obama spoke "a very North American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as "a citizen of the world", as "always does", "He spoke as a American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wings, the Bush era halkon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech of "monotonic, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocent, he warned.
However, the press on the left praised the president.
The Angels Time, although he still believed that Obama had received the Nobel in advance, described his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "prepared the speech that was needed," said the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as shady and upbuilding".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, road sector trade unions and the Tlf (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patron organization that remained until the end of the day, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement ending the strike and the threat of Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were withdrawn by giving a doorway.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 a.m. was necessary for the agreement of all and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very detrimental to businesses" and "was afraid to disturb the parties at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or locks in the supply centres.
But there may always be some rebellious disconformity, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and between 100 and 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and respects the employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the 3 per cent travel costs and the holding of general meetings of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the issue of extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million-euro drop in employer charges" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the draft correction finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The Tlf signature allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to undertakings which are members of this organization and, secondly, to all professions, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR reported that it was a "genuine trade", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to avoid those who wish to eat pudding in the next Nochebuena dinner, Unostra was saddened.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector for the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions that disagree with RATP's proposals
The conflicts in the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their application for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to a train of each two in the central section (La Défense and Nation) and a train of each four in the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galeries, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that "RATP is trying to provide service to large shops".
The RER A cross from West to East is the Parisian city.
The RATP ranges from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in each of the two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in the valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no riot in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
Saint-Lazare Station was not filled, SNCF indicated, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with destination came or went from Saint-Lasare station to join the metro.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RERs A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even intertends its proposals of prima facie, the CGT said angry, noting that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the working conditions", said RATP.
What also led the unions to say that the company "did not care about the end of the week".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which was refused until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a notice.
Trade unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Usa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with a million passengers per day.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from €2,200 to €2,700 gross and from €600 to €650 premium, by schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked protests of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the government's task, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DPP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kilic, told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, and added that 37 of the party's leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, are members of the political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the Party's property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinaya in 2007, who accuses DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Tribunal takes place at a time when the Government is holding a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds cease to support the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a solution could generate a rise in tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of protests against the conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's arrest had degenerate into police confrontations over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators have met in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the southeastern population in its majority by Kurds.
The Forces of the Order threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators threw Molotov bombs or stones with honks.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk stated that the decision of justice was going to "deepen the discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, the press said.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of the parties.
So nothing is solved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snowflakes can start suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the Director of Road Maintenance in the winter of the EFF.
But with this, your employees can learn to test and dominate the whole of vehicle technology.
Maybe at the end of the week meteorologists will announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, they leave 20 of the so-called A trams with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of bombers, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and hanging structures, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the ESF begins around three in the morning
It should cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, within a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which should be adhered to better.
That's why the EFF starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with it the roads are free until the traffic of hours is over."
It's hard when you start snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble comes from, you know Brauburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous and cruise points are cleared.
In general, the FES could not take charge of all bicycles.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which from 22 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. does not lose sight of the bridges, Brauburger comments.
As these quickly become reballadous, the salt-borne vehicle is released as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police may also call them.
The dynasium cunae
The Tawa Findae had the same look as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 150 meters high that ran on the two strong legs behind, had an enlarged head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with wooden hooks and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been something special.
But Tawa foundae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists launched an excavation in 2006 in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triásico sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remaining five specimens gathered together.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "The triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for example.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the Saurios were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: the carnivorous teropodes among which are the Tyronasaurus Rex, Velociroptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithichia herbivoros (sauri with avian pelvis), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa Findae is a primitive thermopod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa skull the researchers found signs of air bags, such as those that also possess the descendants of the teropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were obviously partially air-filled.
Tawa is the older and primitive air bags teropode, says Randall Irmis.
Because the parent line of the later giant sauropods also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, researchers have concluded that the Saurios first emerged there.
Thus, the three genealogical lines separated from South America at the beginning and extended from South America through all the corners of the Earth, which was then still forming a single earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa found the remains of two other teropodes not very closely related.
The three cannot come down from a single parenting predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in the present Poland, notes paleontologist Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted picture, because in South America many dinosaur fossils are still being preserved, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how the evolutionary dinosaurs of a relatively rare sideline of reptiles to the dominant earthly vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
In the Triásico, dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and the pterosaurs and many others.
Towards the end of the Triásico, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while the relative was extinct at the border of the Triásico towards the Jurásico.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs by chance survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories aren't always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slows the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triaic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino from the University of Goethe in Frankfurt has affected the world.
278 professors and professors at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with students in protest at the Campus de Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the governing council.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, expelled last week the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of courses organized by the same students and cathedrals by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served as "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to open the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
A legitimate protest
Young people from the Green Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also solidarityd with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, notes the National Youth Secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, nevertheless defended the performance of the head of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the principal of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented on in a Newspaper on Thursday in the Parliament of the Wiesbaden province.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, Peter Beuth, a delegation from the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the walls painted as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of carefully studying the arguments and requirements of the students, they are excluded.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a site heavily guarded for the secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Innovation Centre in Frankfurt (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "close collaboration protocol" in Frankfurt.
Deputy Moscow Mayor Juri Rosljak and Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt he signed the Chief of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd, representing FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises in the research centre of natural sciences.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will be able to set foot on the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific companies wish to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are the Moscovita Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia of Lemonics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as the "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were installed.
Stuttgart's brakes
The Stuttgart dimension 21 is not set for anything high enough.
For project supporters, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will rush to the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberg a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered fossils of engineering of the 19th century, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, since a huge amount of time was needed in the past to catch the locomotives from behind.
Turn around, stop in the dry to continue the journey; but this must be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a pass station, which is located about half the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there the slogan of "Europe's Heart".
The S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost irreparable to implement the reduction.
Of course, rail terminals also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with the driver's tractor and car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have so arranged.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the contributor rather than by the State.
From a urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
A new urban space is created, with many green areas, probably the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But the modern transport policy must first be to strengthen the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road trucks.
However, the new construction structures are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be missing in other narrow crossings and crossings on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
The slow-step track has been built since 1987.
It would be urgent here to walk the accelerator as it should.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The structure of the Rhine Valley will be the bottle neck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is pending in Wiesbaden's autonomous parliament, if it is to bring an appeal to the court for a night's ban on Hesse's administrative court flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH's ruling of more than 400 pages, according to Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the northwest landing track planned at Frankfurt airport, the Federal State would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if the appeal against this judgment is to be brought.
The opposition criticised this postponement and pressured representatives of the government to give up the appeal to the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their night air traffic ban promises they had made before the elections.
It's quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the head of the Tarek Al-Wazir greens, referring to the FDP slogan "We are fulfilling our word".
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be trying to achieve by means of law abuses and tricks yet to obtain its night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally untenable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the statements of its group on the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks are repaying the aid.
The large U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state assets.
The Bank of America once returned the aid it had received from the Tarp bank ransom fund of a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30 billion euros).
And the Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the United States CNBC.
With this the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had many means, among other things for the sale of items.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers on Wednesday night in particular: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank into the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also seeks money on the capital market in order to be able to get rid of its obligations to the State.
CNBC reported on a source of known circles that the US bank could already announce this Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end, everything was faster than it thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF's administrative board (German television channel) pressures the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present itself to a successor.
Last night the jury wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially in order not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would also not be approved by the Administrative Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet achieved at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed the administrative board with his proposal to renew the Nikolaus Brender contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's resignation was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the Administrative Board had indicated weeks before the election that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editorial chief had been organized by the president of Hesse's government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor with the argument that, under the direction of Brender, ZDF's information would have lost hearing rates.
Shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagged the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, 35 public law experts had been involved in the debate, who described the process of Koch as being unconstitutional.
But it didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
Then he worked on the Southwest Funk station and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heu-journal" newsletter.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF study in capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional request after Brender's destitution, which was elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Media Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative board, the president of the government of Renania-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the State convention of the ZDF in such a way that the Director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority on political grounds.
A withdrawal of party politicians from ZDF control bodies was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized the board for Brender's destitution.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council could vote on him, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a sequential party.
In the calculations of the Frey parties it is awarded in all ways to the Liberals on the left.
University careers get rid of
Some success for students: after a year of hits related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally surrendered. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of licensorship and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically, each module of the course should end with a single examination.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and Universities also want to simplify the recognition of the results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federations commit themselves to making the structural rules together more flexible for Bachelor and Master races.
Federal regulations that differ from this must no longer exist.
Fewer examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and University Directors have been continually talking about improving their ability to perform and successfully finish a career (study).
Now, for the first time, it was a specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to dramatically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "significant reduction in the burden of examination" aims to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the Director of the Accreditation Board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be examined in detail as regards unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to gain more space, which enables and promotes their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These should be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
This would be the responsibility of 10 accreditation agencies across the country, under the supervision of the Accreditation Board, which is established by the federal states.
Ministers for Education and Culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Renania-Platinada has provided additional means for further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student education and counselling programmes, as well as strengthen examination and external offices.
The Federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wanted to bring Parliament a novelty of university law.
According to her, it should be sufficient for a single examination to complete a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, while ensuring recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
Until the end of the coming year it is intended to examine all the races about their "studiability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directives of the Juso (socialist youth) university groups, the setting of education policy should no longer be carried out "three closed doors" by the ministers and university directors.
Not later than after the strikes of education, students as the main stakeholders should now be able to give their opinion.
The president of the Board of University Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need students' experience," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not at all sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to have access to a subsequent Master's career.
In addition, the federal states need to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough studios for Master in the future with the best possible study conditions. Thus informed a member of GEW, Andreas Keller.
Federal states have to find a lot more teachers.
But about more access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrollable," says the first line of a lyrical poem by Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, where he discusses the experiences of arrival to Germany experienced by a dissident who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at the beginning as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught memorable lessons or poetry talks at the University of Goethe, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite yesterday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror disfigured of his security records"
Apparently insecure and disappointed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to participation as IM in the Romanian Secret Service Security against German-Roman writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"So I am someone who has not defended enough against the attempts to provoke fear of security," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and his literary controversy without equal with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are being shaken by a case that demonstrates the abysses and evils of a political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so it is known so far, not only author, but also victim.
In his Record of Security IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him positive of IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Security-Spitzel Wesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the "Time" weekly, after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved would probably have speculated and in some cases would have known what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter's seudonyms.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of security control files is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Security (CSAS) relating to the Birthler authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files has been better followed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Temesvar Security spoke contemptuously of the decoration.
"She has psychosis," she was finally questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turning around in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as well as so many times when there are silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the anxieties of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the Genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple note at the foot.
The League of Champions as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, giving the impression that an elegantly dressed external service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports item manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the bald characteristic had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, he had no alcohol at stake, nor was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it would start again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only been hired three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth of the finals," that is, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blind to success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "a lot more important task" was waiting for them the next Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the league's daily life.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The eighth final of the Champions League (parties of 16/17 and 23/24 February/parties of 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the bright entrance to Babel’s successor remained limited.
Not only in the supposed rescuer, who had soon inspired Stuttgart's mindless professionals to trust himself, willingness to give up and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be launched more, explained the Great soul repairer's recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the Babbel therapist had no effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's winner, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a few weeks of a break due to a injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to her dynamics, tried to describe the phenomenon perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what he obviously missed when Babel was.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs most of all constant.
Like Gross, players and administrators refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and totally beyond the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the sad awakening had arrived, he thought Khedra.
And Director Horst Heldt warned that while a season goal had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not wish to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first victory at his home three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had complained of weakness in the direction of the governing council, which had decided to change training by pressure from teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games would have been eliminated he qualified Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the cigarette.
They'll probably not be friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the replacement coach team, it would not have been possible to show the great strength of the game and battle.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success", said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and also the man in the plastic bag agreed.
Battle of the World Heavyweight Championship
Burntly sorry in Bern: once again, the opponent Kevin Johnson was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC association won on Friday night in Bern to the US Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be achieved.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional battles, twice had to be won because of his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his battle number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Arena de Berna, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, he wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, has been elusive once and for all of the beats of the world champion, so Klitschko could not take his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a speaker, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was taunting Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who supported twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the speaker had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
When carrying out the weight, the champion stopped to provoke Johnson on Friday to remove the sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he then won the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
This year he later won his title defenses to Juan Carlos Gómez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in a very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after the belt was demolished in November to Nikolai Valuev, 2,13 metres high.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Apparently, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, lied to the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because of false information on the Kunduz issue.
The SPD and the leftists require explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of being deceived by a lack of knowledge.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast by the ARD TV channel, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said the minister "has not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The order to kill would have been made without taking into account the rules of the International Defence Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, and Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was reported that in this attack it was not only about destroying the stolen trucks, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people died or were injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel had to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy was part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor, the army and the information service had adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Greens' colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The chancellorship did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and fully about the background of the attack on convoys.
They had officially been said to have denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a field patrol report.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with regard to the complaints made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Announcing Worlds
In a state of surveillance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness but also in drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens during the sleep, everything is in order.
When we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can surrender ourselves without obstacles to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during surveillance, or watch and hear things that others do not see or hear, are considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugs.
It's our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes create the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
The ever-changing state of consciousness can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelical experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the states of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Allusions or deliriums arise when the balance of the neuronal communication substances in the brain – above all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been discarded and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of state-of-the-art dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the iniquitous states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all purposes, assigned formations, and specicisms of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red cheeks like blood, deformed, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Scattered and malignant voices come back from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, binds them to form a knot of anchor, and fastens them on a hook on the roof.
It rises in a box and puts the nude around the neck.
Jump.
The string is released.
What a lesson for you!, yell at the voices in a choir that brings back the timpans, "Go to the clinic and make them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitedness that can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of greatness, disturbances in the relationship, or persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what he is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dream, psychosis also opens up competitions to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of Heidelberg University Hospital General Psychiatry Clinic.
The schizophrenic is in the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoia thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still an unknown reason why our brain makes cockroaches.
According to Fuchs, state of emergency can lead any person to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes there are other determinants.
Researchers assume that the affected suffers from minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected in an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonants of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain transmission system.
When the brain gets warmed
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medicines to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the psych professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
To perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in westerm Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Allusions are among the typical symptoms associated with psychosis, but also, surprisingly, with many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as the limited disorder of personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craneoencephalic traumas.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not stored; when our brain is warmed, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. She was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attended a high school.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a boy has torpedoes with long and dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and she hears that boy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the vision are not real and disappears.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations visually and audiblely.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which is often late and is scarce, he cannot distinguish whether it is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the flies or the girl with bloody cuts in her arms and legs appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Your parents and friends haven't told you anything, they'd think it's crazy.
In the fall of 2009. Sarah K. She is 20 years old today.
He approved last year's selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since he came into contact with psychologist Kasten on the Internet, he knows he's not crazy.
Crazyness is also a work of art for despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulant restriction, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it's responsible for finding entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he's used to reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and noise impressions, to those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult for them to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classes night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation of sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on consciously, imaginary experiences are usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease, but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called omnirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Onyric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers them real and can no longer differ from being awake.
Conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully aware. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung arleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or the world because of a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self- and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A way of limiting sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an inaugural situation in itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not to sink into any loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his oírical experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of salvation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when his conscience set sail several days after an operation of heart valves including heart transplant, while his body was sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen drowned in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was laid in bed, a larger man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snowy snow and met with a Korean mob.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, obesity, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show the fragileness of the inner reproduction of outer reality, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be quite enriching.
The Snow Can Come
Burda
Children will be responsible for the editorial at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has arrived at a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of their children, if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that she would withdraw from the presidency of the Board of Directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed her successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At one point he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was entrusted with the treasure and with this came the responsibility for the company's heritage. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's release, he was also charged with direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is responsible for the editorial.
The sons of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family companies are not safe from the decade: "This has always affected families that are infected by the search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the largest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "magnificent deliriums," Burda says.
I do not see myself as a political precept of this country, as Springer was, and neither do I want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Anything - in terms of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which has just opened a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body in Callao's commercial center (Madrid).
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation; Spa, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Taci hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teatery is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unparalleled views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to fit your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a champagne cup are some of the possibilities that Spain offers.
A total of 250 m2 is distributed in 12 rooms to carry out the latest and latest facial, corporal and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, as well as with virtual 'trainers' that guide customers' steps, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a custom way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the prerequisites for this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Scotches
It is approaching Christmas and it is never again to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party dress.
The form of the escort, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There's a couple of suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona City Council, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will reach arrangements around mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, we intend to push forward what the transport of the future will be.
3 'Electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European-level standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREENDE.
Zapatero sees 'a calm horizon' for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a calm horizon" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures undertaken by the Executive throughout the exercise to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a view of abandonment, closing some of our main productive plants," the president of the government said.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of the brands to be followed in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Automotive Plan (IPA), targeted 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and has provided a "increase in force" of registrations, which grew by "40 per cent" in November.
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount, will be held in Madrid.
This initiative will take place during 5-7 February 2010 at the Crystal pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, the exhibitors of the pavilion can be found accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Pouche car sales and car restoration; or Classics Cochera, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of external competence
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sporting exhibitions, evidence of competence, presentations and competitions.
Tests of skill with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a circuit equipped outside the trade fair.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sport
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sport is not denied with respect for the environment.
Therefore, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system - named i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the engine 2.0 of gasoline with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 stands out by the good note achieved throughout its whole set.
The finishings, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we checked that front boots have excellent ergonomics and subjection.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Following the set formed by the framework of instruments and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and commands and attractive colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, what Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitat, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitat to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
A large and regular suitcase is added to all of this.
The engine standby and automatic start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of six moves.
This engine is a real delight. It is superior to its fineness, its low noise, its performance and its content.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not accomplish a high number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for their high convenience of walking, and for their content consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the so-called Sportive, which incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
From the serial equipment, especially highlights the wheelchair changer (RVM) who removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy lamps.
In addition, if your equipment were limited, this version included the Premium Pack, which adds 1,500 euros: Bixen adaptive lights and BOSE sound system with disk chargers, among others.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
Special emphasis is placed on the quality of the materials used, on their behaviour and on the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not accomplish many kilometres per year can choose from this i-Stop version, associated only with the engine of 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 of the Luxury finish and €23,2270 of the tested version - Sportive.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us every day a great amount of satisfaction.
Lujo's 'Premier'
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have faded more than ever into models as elegant as 'sexys' on the outside of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see a certain type of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the year's products.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly rate, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other with a free live data service in exchange for paying six more times for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, from about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a café with WiFi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago that it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience there is a need for a physical doctorate to understand them and a good glass to read the small letter.
Repeated shots of the European Commission's ears to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a tangible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device such as FonPeek (don't stop being curious that carries the name of Fon when Wifi is missing) gets this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet consultations.
No contracts and no gates.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not by month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a life-access option like what Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'm watching my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
The yellow is, of course, the preferred tone of the first American lady.
If he has already come to Barack Obama's possession as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, no doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections - the two times the acting consisted of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, at first glance, it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat her dress.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it was a fat tie, in Oslo it's a three-piece with a print.
The supplements have also varied: green mid-tack shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And it's also different: a collection on this occasion, a melancholy throws out the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is how the study 'Fecundity and Labour Trajectory of Women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women, reveals this.
The survey carried out between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the labour field due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences at the beginning of spouse life and the number of children, whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, first start life together, advance first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind in life and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after the start of living together, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs has taken longer of their vital journey to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of the pairing," explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that distinguishes women ' s age from when they get married and when they have the first vassal.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age they marry and the first child they have.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those who have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"An additional division among women is also established according to their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at medium or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, enunciating the universal motto of 'Because I deserve it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international panorama, thus joins other famous charts of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a selected club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Milloaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical companion in 'lost').
British Mode Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - designers and models, from yesterday and today - met in the annual award delivery, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing the appointment.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and his daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty radiographs of writers who have spent their literary lives (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical likeness, life and work), but seeking something similar to the core of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent saves no fuss or lights.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulsation, almost physical, the same as I felt without name: pleasure against the iron destiny, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, without meaning, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was absorbed by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotion of adultery combined with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of loss."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of 8,000 meters of universal literature, which has to be climbed through the northern wall, from which the best mountain climbers are once and for all."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
He himself once said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry from a bridge by that character of Munich to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and made it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking the posterity with a violent speech to the Gusanians."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she put on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, please stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer were recorded: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the weary life delights death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband would normally accept that she would tell him that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been the case of such a patient and in love with a neurotic man whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pius Baroja: "What did Martin-Saints do until he tried to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do until he passed Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cella do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Coastal Attack
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, traveled through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of between 15 and 18 years old passed by to her and our dog, a messy breed, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they propeled two legs that left the slaughtered dog.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small and defenseless animal, which was, by the way, attached.
To this we must add the sophistication that provoked a woman who walked quietly and who, when instituting these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, finally, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday any day for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it serves for a long time and not generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to abuse for free an defenseless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, today both entities have reported.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using helmet, as it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injury or even death in the event of an accident while driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond designing and manufacturing products more and more safely" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet in the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which cartels will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop ever more secure products.
Raise the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain account for a 12.6% increase in 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of descent, according to figures from the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers.
The good data, not striking, should be put in quarantine as the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decline over the previous year.
As a result, despite the backlog of the last month, the recorded earnings in these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold combined all vehicles that make up the cabin of small shops: from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/light chassis.
Moreover, the nubarrons that most affect their demand have not disappeared, since they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, restrictions on the closure of bank credit should be added to other factors, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
They can be accommodated, in addition to individuals, autonomouss and SMEs who are going to acquire a small trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam, they recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industry (cars and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which it calculates a decrease in sales (of tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the anti-locking of ABS brakes and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all light re-registration tourism and commercial vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of shortage until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions.
The emergency brake assistant does this by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piston that gives the driver.
But he doesn't always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of Bosch car components, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to tread the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four sinisters would be avoided with damage to persons - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delays until January the plan for Opel
While Opel plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on day 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that more time will be needed to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, claims is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed on by the affected party.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which factories exist to be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows to contact some new possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but strongly collects the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skype sports cars, which is supported by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
On the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and face-to-face, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as their base and managed to slow down nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the bass in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to disregard, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of the lone with manual action, saving 21 kilos; using aluminium doors such as the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel storage from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 7 pounds more; mounting other 12 sports backpacks and with light 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the doors' drawers by one screen, the rest of the kilo.
Although it is also offered with double hug PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly by secondary roads of California, in mountain tracks with really rotated trails
Your behavior can only be described as untraceable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not fit the asphalt with amplome.
Rather, all the contrary: it was a long time ago that we did not test a model so small and light that, at the same time, it transmitted so much security in the step by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk during the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and express his engine again...
What we're asking you to do, thanks to your address, as communicative as it is, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Voluntary engine sound
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be powered with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the brakes of the engine, already stranded previously in the Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car kicked the bags well.
Electronic aid has only made an act of presence throughout the journey; and what we find in some of the curves is ice when dawning and gravy, already entered in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that it is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimacy of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the 'house' shows, the singer spreads his face of malate with as much contumacy as his Chanel bags.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's a Bad Girl.
The Basque Country Gives a Victory in Israel
The Laboral Box achieved a brilliant triumph of 82-91 on its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra Box, despite the many lows with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic was counted, and this way it is located in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was supposed to provide the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to be done with the victory.
In addition, the great truth from the perimeter, with 16 triples noted, had much to do with the final triumph.
The party started face-to-face for the Azulgranas, which were placed from the start on the marker.
That the first four cantas of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presage that they had jumped into the Israeli bowl with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second room was more than the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barak's internal game and Elijahhu's work, which was received with applause and applause in the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' of Splitter's rating had already presaged that it was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being in charge of the rest, was not decided nor much less and the Macabeans wanted to remind the Victorians that in their bed they didn't win any, and with 'the hand of Elijah' they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini have made a decisive contribution to the return of the "yellows" to the light (50-49).
More inconvenient
Ivanovic's, injured but not much less dead, needed to row a pair of games with the right to take air, and in them came the Mirza Teletovic machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a quiet income (54-67), which they managed to make the rooms at the end of the third room (57-67).
The alabasters left the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team didn't give up and try to keep their team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by flaws, Ivanovic's men were not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelites approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent the battle of Uniqueja
The Uniqueja lost sharply in Greece in front of the Olympics and handed over the leader of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the cashist's downfalls, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the peace and friendship pavilion, nor by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed to dream of the Andalusians. One aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, went off to the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Uniqueja , although the local arsenal in the interior game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, returned to the marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, a battle conata, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, subjected to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the lower due to damage to the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal flaws of Carlos Jiménez were tearing away the cashiers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian sloth Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to mount
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even equal the difference between the meeting in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which was causing the group's leadership to tumble.
Uniqueja was trying to overcome the absences and the last low of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unique by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics, when they pressed and gave their height in centimeters within the area, proved unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to lift the basketball sweep 81-62, minute 37, and the Uniqueja turned off, delivering the leader to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with more classified real estate, employment and engine ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculate the user's salaries from the more than 140,000 employment offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the application is running, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "is feeling unremunerated", explained in a communication the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data from Trovit's researchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros a year and a French, 31,059, in front of the 24,000 who receives a Spanish.
Similarly, a driver charges 34.247 euro annually net in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of the comrade, with 11,592 net annual euros; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network over the last three months are driving, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil dates out of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President's resignation shall be suspended by 27 January 2010 at the latest when the term of office of the President is officially completed.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for the business of the Embassy of Brazil in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that date of the Embassy, where he remains a refugee since 21 September.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, when he has completed his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The station also quoted the former MP, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the time limit set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally turned out to be frustrating when Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that he intended to impose on the "de facto" government by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the spring past in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty once again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was to currencyize debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly give cash bar to types close to zero so that financial entities buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start throwing some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of the corporate bonds have re-assessed, although they remain far from the paranormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt again became affected.
Once again there is a quality flight to the USA, Japan and Germany have been the investor-elected shelter, causing an extension of the differences in the euro area countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened with a new review at the bottom of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that it is not wrong to silence moral risk defenders who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy because they have delayed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai's is a tribal struggle between the emirs to compensate for the power in the emirates and Greece's one we've seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that removes the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro-member country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some overruns in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials are widening as well as European corporate bonds should not worry.
If European differentials are decreasing and our differences continue to expand, then it would be a risk of Spanish idiosyncratic.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdotes. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, that return to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not expect much hope of life to their warning.
Again, it has the whole picture that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudentity, friend driver".

Iberdrola's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of Members' Subcommission, which today discusses Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of the President of Natural Gas-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommission.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €5 billion by 2020 and another €6 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power stations remain open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be of 6 billion, but of up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes and power needs to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas plants and carbon plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galan, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to bleed with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "timely" measures, as President of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galan considers that investment decisions, although long-term, should begin to take place as they are slow to maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the 'action' of Aer Lingus and ten airports
The Ferrovial branch for ground-based airport services, Switzerland Swissport, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not exceeded the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance includes an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's work will be to investigate energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Action disputes your first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy company and a water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million).
The French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East coast, has become the nearest option for Action to sit in the country as a construction and concessionary of motorways.
City Council wants to keep it up to date by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP for its English stamps) to advance the project, in a business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the payroll.
Pending their tenders next May, the planned investment amounts to $1,7 billion in Australian dollars (1,047 million) and, in the final phase, it competes with three consortia with a notable presence of European builders.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in Lise, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues, is playing.
The third and last consortium that the crew has passed is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Lightton (the branch of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participating in ACS), the local Baulderstone (the property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatisations, but it has a clear difficulty entering if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, which continues to be a pending assignment for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position on that market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, the owner of the mentioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It acts by a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it has already a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of eviction.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing Adelaide evictors, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention is now to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground pay route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western highway with the bypassing route in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this step of payment would open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel started to be designed in 2005.
It will include two wheelchairs per sense, electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute $500 million (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business in Hochtief
Australia continues to yield remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who yesterday announced the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its Leighton local branch, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with optical fibre cable.
This event will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will work for Germany for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has crossed the 27-floor King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 km in length for a Slovenian motorway amounting to EUR 64,5 million.
The firm achieves this contract days after the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The beginning of the work is scheduled for early 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore was awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract collects the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four remained finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Lots of 63 million to France Telecom for stopping competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and programs of loyalty to consumers beyond regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state company have accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for putting their competitors at risk.
The penalty imposed yesterday has in fact been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the star of other operators and has opened a store of Internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange applications store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have won more money in the competition.
The list leader is Manchester United.
The list leader is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the major clubs.
Thus, the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this department.
The white club has been the third of the continent that the most money has been paid to participate, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extensive European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the ranking.
The list was led by the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams that also billed more money to participate in the last League of Champions.
And that, despite losing both of them in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions, although it has achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to join the Champions League at 1,090 million.
From this money UEFA will devote 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including the Madrid Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they disputed.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for paving (400,000 for each team). octavofinalists will receive three million each; the eight quarttofinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the European Super Cup in August.
But it is also that variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's championship remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of parties played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros by 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa Group described yesterday the details of the sale of shares with which it pursues the acquisition of a peak of between 25 per cent and 29.9 per cent of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for all the titles.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action which would be repaid in 10 years and which would be repaid with an interest in such a delay of 1% annually
Yesterday Sos's shares closed to 1.85 euros; therefore, New Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real appreciation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerezano Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV ensured that it was not informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateas company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos' capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Yours continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay within the limits of possible purchase offers and the judicial vavains of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to take a high position in the food business.
This is a new establishment that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to be involved in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be dismissed that over the next few months His reveals new fund deviations
With regard to the Salazar credit, the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday in the National Audience and said that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's father-in-law who presented Investor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion pope presented by Investor Mer on Federico Paternina last October 9th.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation when it understands that its terms conform to the applicable rules and considers the contents of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced last December 2.
CNMV has stated that the offer is directed to the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of its social capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilised, which will not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has stated that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, as provided for in the existing legislation.
New tools to explore cars
In these days of weather and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinter are dragged to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is the same, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated work.
Manually, the cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30,000, including work pieces, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of less
Thus, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of sinisters and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audex, of the American Solar Group, is the leading signature; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other signatures that compete in the field of rating tools and the development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audex's commercial director, in Spain, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that in the last five years there have been both versions, variants of the simulations than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car leaves the market, these companies start working.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, each model has a "smart" graphic image where you can "pinch" different parts of tourism.
If it is a sales model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that flows, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of databases, Audex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to make different uses and offer various products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing parts of the exhaust or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to develop an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard sinister valuation solution for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each evaluation.
The highest cost is 5,75 euros, for customers who use it very little, up to ten times a month.
After each insurance company, which conducts thousands of searches, negotiates its price with Audex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its number of builders.
AudaGlass concentrates on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to climb by the declared total sinister vehicles.
Your statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by homodole marks.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to abrasions or how many severe sinisters have been suffered in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of tool.
Commercialize, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Rating Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 it has invoiced 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, their process of internationalization began, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, an increase of 3.3 per cent in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and its shares now amount to a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been quoted in the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Online auction of car accidents
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars like motorcycles or special vehicles sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-sine-s.
The transaction was subject to a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million by 85 per cent of the capital of the company, which could be extended to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to their customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, clothing and professional salesmen who must register before they start operating.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of builders has been given down cannot be recirculated, but it can be used as a spare for certain parts that are not damaged.
Historic cars can get high even though they have been given low after some far-reaching management.
Budget for the four-step workshop
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user obtains a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, seek the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals that they are usually more responsive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 all-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use it.
Once the model is identified to be repaired by its number of builders, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables such as the price of the work hand, charges or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that the workshop orientation does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
The Audex company is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics come with very good eyes, as it will, for example, allow you to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
