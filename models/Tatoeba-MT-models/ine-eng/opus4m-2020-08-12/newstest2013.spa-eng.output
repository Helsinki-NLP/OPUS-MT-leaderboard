A Republican Strategy to Obstacles Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this to be a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
In contrast to what is happening in Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, a majority of US governments have introduced, starting in 2009, new laws that made it difficult to sign up or vote.
This phenomenon has been extended since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during 2011, 180 bills were introduced restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal background.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to submit an identity document with photography.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities have rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported billing in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people aged to vote, do not have any identity document with photographs issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have an identity document with photographs.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who most vote for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photographs issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs to vote against the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, in 2011 the Republican legislators supported certain laws that abolished the voter registration on the same day as the poll in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of persons and groups to create an aid service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the period of prior voting.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13 per cent of the voters in the state.
In the case of the Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These do not represent more than 11 per cent of voters, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent no more than 46 per cent of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked a number of bills.
The U.S. Ministry of Tax intervenes to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partyist nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to confirm with certainty whether these legislative amendments on an electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not done?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough to make men doubt, already self-retaining, whether or not detection tests should be performed.
Do you do the test or not?
We have asked for advice from the experts.
Studies in the United States identified a large number of infections among the sampling groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, followed by 12 years of age, also showed that between 30 and 40 per cent of metastasis potential exists if the detection test has not been conducted.
Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years, or from 40 years if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered to him or her, and not necessarily to treat prostate cancers that do not care about long-term life, in which case he or she should be chosen for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress is made, we offer them a treatment.
We have increasingly determined the necessary criteria to decide who should be treated or not.
I recommend that the test be carried out in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not the test should be performed.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobaccoism remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is enormously damaging to the health of people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
The Agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering colorectal cancer.
Charcutaria products must also be avoided.
Keeping the meat for your smoking, dry or saline may cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in the other, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly established.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs Box in Details
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is actually believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it's not completely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks much like the Higgs boson preached by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely safe.
Anyway, let's assume that it's Higgs, because the chances of making a mistake seem small.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and do not try too much, because it will end up harming itself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law in it of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantifying state"; a "state" which consists in a large way of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand there are yours, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the boons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of strength", by which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Boson of Higgs would be somehow connected.
These boys, I could stress here, aren't the exotic bastards we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "particle of light" that acts as "messier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder", an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force bearers" buttons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference between that of another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond in which only a solid rock could slide through the surface.
This is why a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN (the great hadron collisionor is a 27 km circumference ring!) is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself attached to the door of a fridge.
And likewise, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do so have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what "can bring" all these investigations?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to vote the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many earnestly want to meet, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physical" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, you have to say, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such investigations on our day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be none.
To see: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in Bell's laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications may also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light capturer in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as "eye" for all the digital apparatus in the world, which was valued by the Nobel Prize in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec had recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume as soon as a draft law is prepared.
Now, within this essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Devor tried to find him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying her had given her a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I've already had seven," she relates, a passage, lying in her bed in the Victoria-Gadbois palliative care center of Beloeil, which she arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused him damage: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he accepts a resignation to help him eat.
Valiente, she even smiles, talks to strangers who give her attention, bring her medicine and offer her a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is standing on the floor," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer provide "curative" care.
The greatest fear of 89-year-old Mrs. A. is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has caused her children to discover.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I no longer have any desires in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help her death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small, because we all know we're gonna end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
The morbitando is offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, care director.
In the Victor-Gadbois center, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his lunches while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of cancer disease," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
A 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And a number of organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that large relative lack of health care in Quebec, which makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been operating to demonstrate its opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists object to their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already minimal when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she relates.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
No All-Powerful Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who claim to die are grateful to their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once they have been relieved of their pain through a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent with regard to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal's home, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a journalism grant from the Institutes of Health Research in Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mob count, day after day, what they know of a tremendous "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mobs.
A "industry" that came out too expensive for the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system sprays once we have hunted the big media," ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into the abuses linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, at that time had not consented more than to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", he adds, while he hopes to be able to "demonstrate the existing strategies behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also applies to its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit is also operated by the police of the "Marteau team", who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "cartel of the cantarillado" moderate at the time of entering into contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registered in series of charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
Subsidies are suspected to have been repeated in exchange for public contracts.
He has been formally accused of engineers of the Montreal road network and Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter has been shocked to explain to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mob-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Montréal Union, mayor Gerald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and to the left during the years 2000, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Liberal Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of supply contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, explained this perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and subcontractors from the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for contracts with a range of costs.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices between 30% and 40% on false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately viewing a parallel budget and filled his dirty money boxes.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that made the alarm sound.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the eastern part of the island, it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $5 million and sold by 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money in the electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, it ensures that it takes "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And it adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is mainly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians in the stream of the strategy".
Estimating in 70% the proportion of dirty money spent on financing electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I have been told that this is no more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but this will not change the donation, according to him, "until electoral expenditure is strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
It recommends a complete revision of the public procurement and party financing system: "We can't fall further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story promotes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who will look at the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would that advance explain?
It could be explained by an individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Daily advance next to you.
The technical staff has also brought me much.
And these elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast on the football.
But I'm not going anywhere.
From my beginnings in the preforming center of INF Clairefontaine to my step by Saint-Etienne, I've always moved on to exciting steps.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to arguing at very high levels.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
He's supported by supporters like Claude Makelle, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man that needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one is equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
His trust in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the League of Champions: we have classified for the eighths in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in the face of many and very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish the first of our league in front of the Oporto in order to be able to receive the turn of the eighths of the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is committed to its means for the implementation of the project.
Not to win the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season, we haven't gotten far.
In May we were disappointed because we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year, I think it'll be good.
Even if the big teams like Marcella, Lyon and Burdeos are fighting for the title, I think we're dealing with the guns to take him away.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what's invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won a 4-0 home in Troyes, they still encounter things that blame us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We'll never be able to win 4-0 all weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not been able to qualify for the eighth final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marcella, who were not good at the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We better say we have a Zlatdependence.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the team from France?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulation of game time.
I saw things there and I went out stronger.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this is because we have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have from the first month of Didier Deshamps in front of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the World Classification Group.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us as Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead to the selection in Brazil.
Was the empath (1-1) of October 16 in Spain used to sit on the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a game like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, transactions identified and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as forms of payment.
The rate of the bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning today to round the ten dollars (the rates are quoted on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is no wonder that we are comparing it with global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credit" used to move forward in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes change).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins changes are contained in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key hit is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is due to the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital score.
Computers "cook" the new transaction and add a number before "trash" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular mark (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any change would change the trace.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in warehouse.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight players like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not move.
In November, the "great rains" were launched.
"The $30,000 have been changed," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes enough in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equal to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in trade, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", needs Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are there.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but there may be a change in 2013," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks currently considered high if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for anything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek or the Tayakis join in their cause.
Tolerant, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The French troops of the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, were ordered.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be no Taliban in Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistibly advanced between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His country's control had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the blackout of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old multi-Ahids, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, with government land to sell them back as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have learned to take advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
These young people will have to be employed who will not want to return to the security of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. The television and its Turkish booklets that present a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will flee the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, removing the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the basis of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no embalming has been established, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing happens except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth was growing.
And that only increased the sense that the Westerners were there to take hold of them.
No energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge urban location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools of girls, schools of children, a department of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "gain the hearts and spirits" and of performing the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Cymic), abolished in 2012, brought and made through a small French NGO many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain sites.
These works, greedy to get a local work hand, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and growing areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want to do, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled, and direct civilian aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play everything.
He welcomed everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given that Assembly two more months to finish his work.
And almost two years ago Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial turmoil.
This new initiative has only increased the country's fracture.
For his opponents, the president continued in his "autocratic delirium" and continued "traiting his word" and "scattering the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote my text or keep the full powers," powers which are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted yesterday.
Most Liberals did not come to the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they considered that they could not make their point of view.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, seconded members, were added to all the haste yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As I expected, the articles voted have been unanimously.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, for the fact that one of the few differences in the day had been expressed almost at the time of prayer, so many members of the committee had come to think that the Constitution clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all views, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of the law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "standards", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals hold him out of hypocrisy and consider him to be nothing more than an advert.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular to anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia's laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the preeminences of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of that university would be much less moderate than the present one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not illiterate but academics, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent the civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday received many criticisms relating to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers will claim to be few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the Defence Budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will also not be prohibited.
They also showed concern about the text, which they consider to be libertarian.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially those of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underscoring Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not found in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out on television last night, events were scheduled for this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters were held on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists look forward to the holy land, the obligation of the world, and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and a natural priesthood.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers visit here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Dolorious Life").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was held, and continues on the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in the Golgotha Mount, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointed and the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Obligatory of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 DC.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then become reality.
Perform a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to reach there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to the climb can.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great flood of tourists.
Even there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain there were supposedly pagan gods.
Visit single museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you can't visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, located near Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean wilderness, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has licenses from impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathroom museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private Ralli museum, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and categorically donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You're in it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bath even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a sandstone that easily sustains even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative stones and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Playing the Mysteries of Old Age
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Persian rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you hit the walls on the street of your "mismo" symbol, the fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to wish: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to shequels (currently 1-3$.8 shequels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast traffic and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
Actually, it's from a underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only served kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and sheep meat, soups and pastries prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are cakes of milled barley, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats who "pass their taste" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The hikers love the places they competed for and did not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Besides insurance, it's going out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go out for 15 shekels a day.
Access to museums costs an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% of the same year 2010 index, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MEPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory review, there have already appeared in the country Timing trading with “false” certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay home.
From 1 December, a law enters into force which requires each migrant worker to carry out a review to verify his knowledge of Russian.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to review the language, if not the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens from countries where Russian is the official language are exempted.
Persons who have obtained their education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate hosted by the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be presented to trials in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, have often managed to ask this question to the press: What will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligation of language knowledge, both for the Russians and for immigrants themselves, bring?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
Immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical control have problems.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, place a "paid old man" to a spy and narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they do not pay their promised salaries," says Tolib Sharipov, Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of Tajikistan Immigration Service.
Don't get mad, boss!
However, while so many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not your fault but your own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give children to eat, not to speak to them, to dress them, and to buy them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work on the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not that easy.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and by only a thousand and five hundred rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was pointed out that not only immigrant registration documents could be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed in standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles through the document.
This is twice as expensive as the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the "diplomas" can not be bought, persuade government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not have successfully spent the first time studying the basic language course.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic action against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigorously with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Punishing fires during wedding celebrations in which there were fortunately no victims, and the massacre launched by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Punishing seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatized weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law would be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, the authors of which, representatives of various social shooter organizations, demand that such measures be withdrawn from "unsuitable rigour".
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, according to the news service of the Russian BBC, criminal lawyer Vasily Lésnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, for six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that more stringent legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be a disadvantage for the offender to be addressed to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the High State.
Screenshot of the web site that accepts gun requests
The first, "fighting of the army or the military", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that here are the stolen weapons of police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come out for sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were caused premeditatedly to cover the lack," says an exile.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also put on their sand granite.
"Now they have distributed private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the black market, including those in Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes crafts, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit supply of weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, crime literature and data on public access to portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market's weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where armed conflicts exist, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during arms production, and 5 per cent are related to “illegal archaeology”.
Depending on one of the arms stores, which requested that its name be not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers address military stores when they need a match.
Through some leverage, the supplier buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
Remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"He brings the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we're told.
"But, of course, the police are at the heart of all matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan is to be implemented, they make proof purchases to illegal arms dealers," the addict adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who proposed to me was on the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would lead me to a "squint" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I'll find out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the store's addict. "I have a friend like this, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also a need to get there, let's say "by Mr. Ivanovich, who asked him to tell you that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I'm not going to deal with it.
The new arrivals are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of illicit arms buyer in the mid-1990s when an article on this subject was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn't "everything."
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer milk cat: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"You give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure that the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal encounters are required for this purpose.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising notice "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
There, users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," ask the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," Laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at the hands of those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the liver, and then to extract carbon in Siberia.
military commentator and exile Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one remains unarmed and is put in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at the hands of those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the liver, and then to extract carbon in Siberia," he says.
Makarov per 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-class bosses.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which was 22,900, and the number of cases identified as theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are hit.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against low wages has begun in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to ascertain whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and start in its first stages.
Protests have the support of trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast-food system, the goal of protest organizers is to create labour unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, it began the lowering orgy that caught millions of inhabitants, and that sometimes it was accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protests with trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything, from pants, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and disposal of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at a very low price, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the bad working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
Those "Black Fridays" participants in the event demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker who receives $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $1.39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" extended in its shops from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the Huffington Post left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had not been more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the workers' union.
"Free face!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the big Walmart stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and therefore there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells thousands of millions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for illness and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to the federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
Nobody wants less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald's and worked there, behind the indicators, in part time after school, although they were still living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to give them to eat.
Participants in the protests, who started at 6:30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start to pay at least $15 per hour, i.e. that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing the activists of the union movement with arrogance and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disagreements
Noise protests took place that very day in other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place half of the myth in McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of the City Council of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he is selling thousands of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
Protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers in order to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves".
As described in the New York Times, this has been the greatest event in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York fell.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to cause a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of increased reality, so popular among those who love modern technologies, is recently generally perceived mainly through the special glass prism.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference he demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was revealed that for scientists in that company, the glasses were already part of a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group?
- We are dedicated to personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes the touch with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ago and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computer science must be released to our, to our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
Of course, he cannot be considered a panacea, but it is still important to resolve the issue of privacy, as it is not always desirable for others to learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project that we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured, not by the device camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can precisely determine the person's reactions.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on X and Y axes, but also on Z.
It is also important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the human-machine interaction.
To me, it would be very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the tables per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared emitter and the other is the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, he hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from the glasses to the smart phone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in which it is your strength (private things you can only see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glass will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences, I often say that increased reality is the seventh interruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth good could be the addition of touchy sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared to making these "images in the air" tangible. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to which one feels if someone is supplanting it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also cuffs for the doll that influence the nervous endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Let him think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of racing bands (not like the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as the giant globes.
For now, cheating on the brain is not that easy, you still have to work for many years.
This is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of complete conception.
Personal taste subjective instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a barbarian man dressed in red from above, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion and opening meetings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they want to be displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's vanguardism at the end of the 80s - in the early 90s.
Moreover, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts up all the state of spirits.
Recently, he took in his hands an organist and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such difficult roles, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creator of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray is causing aggression and agitation of property nothing good.
But my provocations are directed to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still unintelligible.
I became a friend of the artists of the new wave, with those who were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I went to the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters.
And all this came together in your Art Clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Lenningrad."
Trachtenberg was an encouragement to many programs prior to the Hali-galivskih times.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was made in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Pays".
The strawberries are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, but now it's painful and frightening.
But in the strawberries everything gets pregnant and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesco, I have grotescas ideas.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes.
Now one follows him through the clothes, pointing outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't be given a hand, but spit it on his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We just saw you in the role of urban organist.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, can commercial art best be beautiful?
- Now the art of commerce must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into commands, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now that all have been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they're coming for thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see it, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to waste what you have achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up with.
Now concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied the money just to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a culture officer.
But not all of them can be devoted to culture.
When the kings were the right things were different, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are very good consultants now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level that properly evaluate these and open the way for them.
He is now enjoying the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. Moscow has much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious about exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Light in the Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board go looking for a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How do we continue the species in pregnancy or on the same reserve planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in March are better for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
The problems of reproduction began to be addressed in space with the flower.
Half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of Orbit-cultivated guisants were not different in any of the earth's varieties.
Then came the breed of insects in the orbit, small flies of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of pregnancy.
We get a normal pollutant as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this contaminant has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems Laboratory (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the contaminants returned at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the tragedy was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we managed to have the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarca" flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habit, simply cannot carry out their sexual instinct.
However, man, unlike small animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was most at risk.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the airspace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratorium of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under zero floating conditions, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its natural element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a recently born swim monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women there is a need for pregnancy, the strength of gravity.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvis muscles are decoupled very quickly, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, we missed that, trusting in the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, light up in a special chamber, and it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asked this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, such as adults.
He'll just be deprived of what's vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will allow us to bring the Earth to a disabled person, to a totally inadequate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the "svarc" system has not been done with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application is inadequate.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are missing," says the current situation.
Joint controls by the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions the attitude of Petr Neczas towards the system of being independent only on the paper, which is known as the system "svarc".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if something prohibits, in that case, neither can the president of the government prevent the performance of the office which has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to require obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of Members, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, which compared the public procurement legislation in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out some two years ago.
This is in a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this is followed by existing legislation in each country and then by practice in itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually do? What do you think the conclusions are?
That is precisely what common control of this kind could help us to stop investing in law enforcement, reduction and improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means achieving something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of the reduction in the limit of the tenders means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is so saturated with "papeleo", that those who want to look for system failures can do so more easily than if the limits were as high as they are now.
You are talking about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office like our NKU or is it otherwise organized?
In how many offices, such as NKU, there the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with a similar organization to ours, with a college, is the only thing that in your case is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
The jurisdictions are also to some extent similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level, which is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but one cannot precisely specify what is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparison.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, they wouldn't have any benefit working with our office, would they?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the public procurement law mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, it is necessary to have a certain delay.
For now, the process of preparing future controls has been observed: we have started a new tool of "non-economic risk detection", which has led to almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a stumbling block to the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the legislation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous legislation, controlled persons were bound to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which does not affect decision-making.
A system of this kind will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this way started.
The prime minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Schwarc system, with reference to the fact that he is independent only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the Schwarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if something prohibits, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the performance of the Office which has an obligation to carry out such controls and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the legislation is quite strict as to how it should be formally acted, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best bid for failure to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we are lacking.
Roads have ice plates, although most of them are transmissible
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transmissible, in some cases caution should be extreme.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transmissible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, in the crests of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the road traffic control centre in the region.
The fast R6 and the first category road in the region are now transmissible without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on certain bridges whose surface may be frozen and rebalancing.
All second and third level roads, including mountain roads, are also transmissible.
However, in some of them there are still layers of ice and saturated snow.
There is a need for increased road attention, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, informs the Roads and Highways Directorate on their pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice plates forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
They can be frozen in the immediate vicinity of Lanškruna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoký Myta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Giant Mountains in Orličí Mountains.
There is an indoor snow cover in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally fluctuate between three low zeros and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are transmissible this morning, although caution must be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the time.
In the early hours of the morning there will be ice creams, temperatures will rise between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent temperature decline, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from the information provided by the road traffic control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitible almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most of the first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be ice sheets.
Second and third category roads are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transited roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers headed to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will be partially snowed.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators took off the snow during the night; on Schumper's road some three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Schumper road, snow remains.
The drivers at the port of Červenohorské will meet with a half-dried snow in the direction of Jeseník," a road manager from Šumper to ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transmissible without restrictions, in the Šternberská road, drivers should drive with caution in the forest plots, where the roads continue to be wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported on complications in different structures at the first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept under zero, even in the lowest areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the footwear. On the other hand, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central mass, there are no problems and roads are generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded by the mother.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and the night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to catch.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organized a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-owned act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential at the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the previous day, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organize 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish about the same time as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who happened to this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were all forming the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called hymn against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, canceled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can you listen to beneficial concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, good, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time in the three concerts.
The hymns will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interprets Jesus' protagonist role in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial acts and concerts...
Let us make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested in and want to work with us.
What will be the purpose of the money collected in the concerts against the end of the world?
To equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studio, which we carry out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedlichkov estav.
Students at the Jedlichkov estav school receive regular visits from teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic means to pay teachers, and we make an effort to do so.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedlichkov estav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
There are several groups and interpreters at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratesphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival Pražské Jaro, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The coming year would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of us in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalists, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these journeys?
It's not that hard as it may look at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheel chair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which I am not surprised at.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a short time ago, everything came out without any problems.
Thanks to going abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still not common for a person to move alone through the city centre in an electric wheel chair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in the wheelchair in the elevator, it's not there.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been created that seeks to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going after...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to move on their behalf in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or unhindered society is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the band in 1998?
I went as an educator in Jedlčkov estav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovič says, we left a little of our hands (smiles).
However, popularity has not reached these last years, am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new comes with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out well for people with disabilities, then it is not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did you help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do a quality job, we must be rigorous in many aspects and require discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently the The Tap Tap group has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lādja Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
He who is willing and willing will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the world's expected end, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena de Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will take part in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect to the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The purpose of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment from the educational centre without barriers STUDEO in Jedlichkov estav de Prague, whose cost is 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have a free entrance to the pre-sale option in Bohematicket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began to work closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission during the following years.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already dedicated to flying to space before the Second World War, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory where, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch award in France for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautism, he was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and it is not known the project's disadvantages either.
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the dress or for its braking.
Information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to be dedicated to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Arms in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawe Wolfkem and Prof. Gustave Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study was published "Rakieta - torpeda poietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all draft missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautische Society (Polish Towarzystow Astronautique).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, for the first time reference is made to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, Professor Subotowice proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) had longed to be a member of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimier Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He performed this duty until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Meteorological Rakeita), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apex of 1,800 metres, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Błūdów desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket averaged 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was going to be the object of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a 14.5 km apex and its mission would be to control the wind at the height.
However, the work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was Meteor-1, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) developed, which differed from each other by the space available to scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum landing in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the context of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the Space Space Research on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Labour Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional judge suspended the Social Dachabajos Act.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will then be interesting to examine the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The case is at the beginning of free trade and of the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with uninterrupted financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (of wages) results in economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to cut off distances and for this reason "makes a low price" of the competitor with the aim of making himself with most of the market and thus increasing its margin of profit.
For most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad means buying cheaper or better disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the social expenditure of the state.
This whole situation is conducive to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Non-scrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, where the governments of those countries are obliged to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is made clear above all in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to compel the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in respect of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing the differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public with regard to the situation of assistant employees of the German federal parliament.
The measures to save virtually all the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same situation.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for an infinite part of a European salary.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by stifling control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its political course with its selfishness and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
Evidence is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, without financial resources, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is subsequently adopted in the German Parliament, the Bundestag.
Thus, all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracy with a liberal orientation is rapidly in a situation like the one described by Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesarea and Pompeii: "The state had time to disintegrate and the administrations occupied the force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegally and help finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread unhindered and people went to the urns with the pre-vote vote... "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consulates"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appian thought in Pompey, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in the past, is that the present society is based on unbiased preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not, in essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the growth of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought for the unimpeded liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a defined break, pending the next blow.
The really depressing fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen the participation of both the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the position of the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing comes from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his fragile song and whose stribbillo prays "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget what fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be no" Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his bed of death in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One on the Israeli side argues in favour of the right to self-defence and enlists Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and the flag of Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the repeated killings and who is the victim. Finally, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the ceiling, a look to find out who will benefit from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on who or what group of people is the main proponent of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
At each time we can find a Magnificent Alejandro or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps independently or whether behind their throne there was someone guiding their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we are living at a time that concentrates the wealth of the world on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschild.
It's not written very close to them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great seriousness. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant a strengthening for them.
They have important stakes in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or preparing for a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after Iraq's attack there were 5, after defeating Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who's tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Bank of Rothschild Central America, began during the Secession War to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the big economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchy states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong, and they always make the situation worse. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the one of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, the First World War was triggered, the Zaireist Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly and unwarrantedly ended from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end the Zaireist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demise of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare for World War II, the bankers and politicians secretly created a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the poor masses. Afterwards, they were enough to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to the culprits, and to build a later Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned earlier laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
It was the Second World War: it is hard to know whether Hitler pulled too much from the rope that the international bankers had attached to it in principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, like in World War II, would become a first-line victim, now together with the Arab population or, generally, Muslims of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within its country, but also internationally. Let us take an example of how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are divided in a touching way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where did injustice lead to injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning there was the greed of some individuals and their thirst for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their deputies, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does all he can to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, where 20 per cent of the world's oil passes through (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy.
Under what light is now shown the words that David Rockefeller spoke in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of well-favoured financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And obliges all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, who adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six hundred and six."
Argo Film: If you get rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students held the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release would be in exchange for the corrupt shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive perspective: throwing the shah across the board could not allow it, since, if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified even more with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
Prisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck is the subject of an episode of this story, which has brought about a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a difficult time, they ended up living in the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, which helped a comprehensive story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that looked at the country's location for a superproduction of fiction science.
Gender mix
The plan that the expert drew up in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie appear true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, and the fictitious production society even had a real office.
The details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of different kinds.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper motion", the story of an episode that came out well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the state of mind. We find on one side well documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits there are symbolic photographs of the time of events, which were also placed in the film; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the central CIA and other institutions: brought men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the halls of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to resume his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long meter, after "Adiós Small, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Afflick's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of the directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teher will "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the uncertainty and the lack of predictiveness that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the taxing team at the Tehran base).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story did not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes something adds to the reality: it doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America, and the search for unscathed after its track becomes a madness).
Argo's softness is the discontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, or much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a bit of dramatic traces, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, to appreciate its realization and style back of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it goes down, that's gonna be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of the excessive that may be the notion of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services, that is enough.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who presents an annual survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 per cent share of women in leading positions in European large companies," said Právo Patrik Naker, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they are objectively at a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Naker informed.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of dangerous substance or the directive covers the size of chicken cells, which has contributed to a considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The fact-finding ban has been criticised for the use of the expression "butcher of wool" or the removal of the classic bubble from trade.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes this type of decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "unnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it seeks only to harmonise the non-harmonised national standards to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate for the survey could be the EU requirement last year that in the inflatable clusters that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to infiltrate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, the globes are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of slaughterhouses by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are even born in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. To avoid damaging Greece's sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the Laissez Faire Liberal Economists Association, appointed, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for canned silk, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that there is no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often clear of criticism, EU regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibers, as are other countries in the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of Olomouc's requisition, but they had to change their name to the national rom, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it turned out to be "tuzemák".
Only products obtained from the distillation of sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the feta and gorgonzol cheeses known all over the world, the mazapan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, for example, are already the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Carp of Pohorëlice and Trebonó and, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As EU protected mars, they may be proud of Pardubice’s ginger bread and the Horíce bars in Podkkonoshi.
People want to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you get to the election for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't be presenting my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are being punished, taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I didn't have any ambitions for being a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has been headed for the presidency.
Aren't you giving the back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later, I specified that if a senator was elected, he would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of the television, but that we poke at anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which despises you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have subjugated journalists what I have been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibility of politicians and the declaration of ownership of over 20 million is presented.
To that end, the law must change.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to recognize the leadership office as an autonomous job, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without incarnations or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is a man on the right or on the left considered?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people think I'm more left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get out of here.
I don't care if anyone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KSCM or the ODS, and I will also be against the bad ideas.
He jokes when he says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it with what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be some who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without Parliament's support, only signs remain.
And this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or do you believe that if you address people and talk to them, will you, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have another choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they'd have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points out the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
We take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find allies.
I have just begun politics and I try to get as much support for my programme as possible.
I am trying to get things out of the way myself, but if it doesn't work out well, within six years I will leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that I do nothing with a person, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, because they are best encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, at least I have supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who has brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, and now I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population did not go to the urns and those who did so voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for it, to check the impenetrable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have any money for the presidency's campaign, and in my transparent account, there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
She's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land valued at 25 million, a land valued at ten million, another land rated at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million, and a Schkoda Superb valued at one million, and in my account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evil and injustice.
Drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you have no sponsor shows that there is no undue interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign's expenses cover essentially what I'm going to receive in terms of Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't introduce myself as a candidate.
So will you continue your business to live?
Haven't you said before I was going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would like it to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you get to win monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I were president, then I'd leave business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkennies library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkennies, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a runaway visit, boasts the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of decorated goldsmithic miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Wine Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar charts and the manager of fun buildings in the pair as cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was looking around at him and worried about his shoulders, Maas began to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkennies, called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and residential buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town with no history, which has so far had nothing but to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town after whose white facade one would rather intuit a milk plant, now has a contemporary architecture work.
But above all, Spijkennies now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
Well, it's true that there's an elevator that transports us right into the center of this mountain mass, but the true lovers of space and reading don't use it, but they prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully crystallined interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the tile floor collected and the elegant lighthouses undoubtedly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you raise your sight you can see the park banks, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And on all sides books, books and more books.
"Normally bookshops are available along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put legs on the classic spatial configuration and to remove the reading area from the inside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention is deserved by the black stalls that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and rocking it at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkennies.
And so it is like one day, in a Frisian agricultural farm, we are meeting with the appropriate by-product from agriculture.
For many years now, in winters and in the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of low thickness millimetres has been used as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts for two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library this fabric was first pressed into such quantities until it reached plates of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a new car mixture and sports shoes.
After 105 pilgrims arrive at the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits the reward: not only does the café have a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy a delicious Dutch croquet and its fig planted in huge machetes.
These create a pleasant atmosphere for the pair that maintains the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it's expensive to believe it given its large crystalline surfaces, this building is an example project with regard to ecology," says Trouborst.
The required heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden loops located in a cross-sectional direction to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "dark soul" of Spijkennies.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that took place a few weeks ago, everyone in the city was invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its full file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been silenced.
The barns are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain connection to this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even though he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this royal discipline that in the specialized argument is known as "the creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the youth and inculcate what it can be.
Finally, a starting point to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S. relations, this puts Berlin in a rather pelagic diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer State of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
Finally, however, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from establishing a flight ban zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because its foreign policy is currently being refocused, away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans are on a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, shows willingness to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why he must be careful and not alienate himself from the Arab public opinion nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you that much importance, since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German attitude enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic breakup as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has managed to earn some respect.
After all, all of this has not been done but demonstrated that it is a country to which they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to US domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama government is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a superior body, but they must push things out of their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, it is simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a pelagic theme.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?
Or maybe it's still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not been accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still costing it a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are removed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be around the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States on European policy is increasing, but the EU does not currently cover this gap, who is left?
Germans will have no more remedy than taking a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it's life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name a name is hidden officially registered in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not submit a claim.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them reason.
"For foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, counsel at the Taylor Wessing buffet specializing in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my desk.
The simulators simply add a few letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports articles Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive where he holds seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well-known.
In the large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsifications.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different kind. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to benefit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or the accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is huge."
Financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market of luxury goods and which is growing at a higher rate.
However, to achieve the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also entails a lot of money.
The processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long that the object name of the claim had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is lucky, he may even have to pay money to the plaintiff because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the forest.
Some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost an argument against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has been absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of Putzmeister hormigon bombs.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the star of Mercedes.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a logo in white and blue that remembered BMW very much; the case was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking at the original direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labour emergency situation returned to normal".
Thus, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it would mean that China is leading the list of new inscriptions around the world for ten consecutive years, according to the brand office.
This also seems to happen with the number of valid logos, which amount to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been paid in respect of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each entry costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copyist.
Although Germans have been able to stop the illicit manufacture of imitation car parts,
the simulator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because the surnames in Germany are not protected," says Hanno Wenzler, President and Counsellor Delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the use of municipalities.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg has been given the reason, but the opposite side continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now come to the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wenzler was confident that he would be able to resolve the issue in a favourable manner and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review records of up to one hundred years old to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "sum of six figures in euros" in order to reach a friendly agreement, but failed.
"This shows how much we care," says Wenzler.
The dangers they face in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if the simulators are secured there with the rights of unprotected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long abandoned this area of trade, but had managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wenzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what is to be done is "to register also in China everything that can be protected", as Wenzler points out.
On the contrary, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last attack on his particular battle, then he would have to pay the other party's licence rights for his own name, as Wenzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Corps and in Swaziland, the AIDS orphans are delighted
The story of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, tacon shoes and mocasines look for the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then will the voices of the singers (contrary, low, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, repressing, injuring and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box almost by trying to sort out his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of Heidelberg's Institute of Medical Psychology, the Imbongi choir is trying a new song.
Fifty singers have also arrived from 23 to 69 years of age, from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language hardly known: the zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to have around 34 million people worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Esiteni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month a child can be paid.
This contribution will cover the school registration, uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story narrative" or "panegirist."
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this bungalow language, but to sing yes they know.
For ten years this choir has been testing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manage to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 km of direct line from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esiteni which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty per cent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitijen is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection to half.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with something over thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this prominent population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the opportunities in a poor country are more than few.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few which made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
One year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally occupied by AIDS orphans in Esitje.
Facts about sexual transmission infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the bacterial strains.
The most common viral ETS are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are among the satellites transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are infections by chlamydia, tricomonas, the human papilloma virus, candidiasis (Hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, cryidia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or vertebrates.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer protection to 100 per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently from sex to sex.
If early diagnosis occurs, most of the ETS can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees paid by the crown for its actions in all Germany, a lot of money is raised.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros in total to Esiteni," said proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a woman safe of herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care of orphans to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "googs", as the older women are called in zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care of children coming to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two hens, and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has achieved that many of the people have undergone a HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is all over the country, it is not often spoken of openly.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and overcrowded lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted lifestyle is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years across South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still remember the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with you an excellent atmosphere and great joy, but has also managed to tear a couple of tears to someone else than a angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitje, where the singers visit the adamant children.
Although this small population appears only on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is very well known.
"Talk to Esiteni, there shines the light," says the people of the place.
And after walking the 8,733 km online straight back to Heidelberg until the Bergheimer Street test rooms filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being treated as the nearest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems to have at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
Water is supposed to come from comets or, most likely, asteroids who in their day were shocked against Mercury.
No one relates the finding of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says the Chief Investigator of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help clarify how the water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwarranted for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that form our solar system, in addition to the planet Enan Ceres.
Like Pluto, which rotates around the sun right behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newly born" stars.
This region of star formation, called little romantically by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This revolving image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star excavates in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebulosa, 5,400 years of light from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation area.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with a simple view in the night sky.
However, the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Helicopter Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 years in light of the constellation of Aquario.
Its similarity to an earthly continent has validated North America's nickname.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a colorful spectacle.
This star could be captured in its entire splendour for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is still one of the great incognites of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving track 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most clear photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Galaxy of Remolino.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebulosa located several thousand light years in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), since dark dust lines divide the clumsy heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Offiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million years of Earth's light, the nucleus of two galaxies in the fusion process are balanced toward each other to end with an irreparable shock.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname of the Australian Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Nebulosa Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The 1,400-year light nebula is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located at 430 million years of Earth's light.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also continually new stars; at 5,000 years of light from the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope is being raised.
It allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its huge capacity to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is equal to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radiotelescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI for its English stamps) can help any person who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Very Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
By 2018, images are not expected to be taken.
By 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hands of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 global candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 to 2018 rocket.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice in the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no factual evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger 2004 survey, the first to orbit around Mercurio, scientists now have the assurance that it is.

To the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach Bible age.

A search for leads in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The trip through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great streptio through the sinuous road that passes by forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here live the "tayshi", a people who are not well known, apart from perfectly dominated by the Persian and the Azeri and who are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumes of a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists only reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
It takes eight hours to cross the 323 kilometres that separate both urban cores, because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May because of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen thalyshis of the place that have over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his children died at the age of 136
However, the undisputable star of the museum is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the older man of documented age lived 122 years, it seems that Muslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva tells us.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a new daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "including in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence on age; maximum when there is no civil registration.
Each day glass filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do you live here, in the south, so many older people?
The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially all the milk products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a bottle of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what he styles for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house throughout the Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves tirelessly a huge butter cloth.
Eight people live under a roof, one of them sons and one of Mirzayeva's daughters, both became grandparents long ago.
They also play side by side with two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in a typical glass of dirty shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and underneath the panel hides two long strips of dark brown hair that your son finds proud of us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, which is why I've never fallen and maintained my color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and guises.
In my whole life, I've never gone shopping for a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar period of World War II.
However, everything came back to their senses when the "loved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a larger woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship of the nation's fatherly figure, which governs his country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, when the witness handed over his son Ilham.
At least the older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's poor son is right: "In our culture the older ones are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that compete with each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is mixed up.
The future constitution, with the sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't scurry into patriotism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Are you claiming to deny your power to the trial?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean by "principles"?
This was and is still open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has emerged, to impose a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout all Sun Islam.
It has no reason to do so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Most of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert severe repression against the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the drafter establishes, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
This is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it is nothing but censorship.
It is true that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
In exchange, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits “people’s offensive”
Is it enough for the president's caricature or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to the referendum.
"The revolution has come back"
Weeks ago, the opposition was closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir del Cario Square and swore to have the Act fail before it can come into force.
"The revolution has come back and we will come to an end," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes the third place in the lists for presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft of the Constitution should be "in the cube of the waste of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state blow against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been forgiven," was quoted in the Egyptian media as saying to the political opponent Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made an appeal to hold a counter-manifestation; for if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean up the country" at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the Tahrir symbolic square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the Morsi supporters did not want to risk anything like that.
The Muslim brothers said that those who opposed the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views high and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the urns which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamist draft has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were detained in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led to the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You're designing a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian raffisk: is the world's most fragile fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life, not just Europe but the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country will preserve any relationship with its greed for a fish that is extremely ill?
Take a series of excessively curative cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralysing aroma of raffisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The raffisk is a sauce trick that lets you fermented in water during, depending on the malady you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, the Norwegians go to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this food most, so to speak, captive.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of water from a pot," says Harvard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
We all see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from an important intake of drink.
"Some people like the aquivit more than the raffisk," says Havard.
Drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a sushi portion that's traveled a few miles by bus.
Racfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty flourished in Norway and in which, before cooling, fish were kept during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the full winter, when it is already well fermented, it is extracted and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country for work, and they mainly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Raffisk is considered something important, an essential part, although rather ill-fated, of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich cost you the 10€ ($14) fridge each.
Norway does not often appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still not ready to pronounce Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22nd".
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs could commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, growth has been found, since the early 1970s, from one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our comrade, as she passes raffisk flags and that, with her long ruby melinena and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to tinker, we don't like ostentatization."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years prior to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the ticket very closed.
"While we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat raffisk," he adds with a loaded development.
I'm in the snow doing glue to eat something; I've already had enough raffish.
Now an alce burger is undoubtedly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he's gonna be that sick fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a Racfisk dinner is held in which the officers vote the best fish, or perhaps the most challenging of the nose pits.
A TV has been connected live to a presenter who wears pajarita and is surrounded by Rakfisk dishes.
The Eurovision contest seems to be.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughs and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquarium.
Or maybe the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his post, the BBC correspondent Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already self-congested, a steel circle has been installed since Monday which cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and which is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
It faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war on drug trafficking that has been charged some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence with the Mexican people," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before coding with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the oral city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism at the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which means a huge improvement compared to the paved roads and plenty of bays that have been rehabilitated.
There are also signs with its name in the entrance of a modern multi-sport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, PRI.
"Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, PRI was set free by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party with regard to Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic man of state and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast with the accommodated streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Juárez City, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto said, in the best of cases, that I did not know how to address the problem of femininity while in office.
The most critical accuses their administration of making the fat look.
In a house of lobster, typical of the damaged neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
His family, however, believed that his partner had murdered her.
"When I arrived at his home, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, along with a cross in which she reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says it has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old chismosa, an abortionist, a complainer.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up."
"But that can't be when there have been so many irregularities and so many negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope to be the kind of president he was when he was governor," says Pri Olvera MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of the Neza City are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during their stay in prison
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military arrest.
During the interrogation conducted by the prosecutor at Manning in a pretrial trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits to the unit's officials for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a view taken on the basis of the defence's request that the case be dismissed because its imprisonment had been severe and that it had already suffered enough punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while being detained.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while in service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and commented on his answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the jailers as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officials asked Manning directly about the treatment she was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officials who visited him had talked about these issues and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they had not been informed of those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he had received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction in the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was living.
The military said they had placed it under that restrictive regime, which was below the control of possible suicide, in order to ensure its protection and safety to others.
"I wanted the largest state to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... in order to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he had lost his knowledge due to heat.
He said that the fact that he would not be allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that after moving to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a hammer, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to fall asleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out of his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the lockers couldn't see his face when he was back at night, they would wake him up to go back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal claim in January 2011 concerning Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to remain naked in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the bill.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he deduced from the order given by the jailer who should have let the blanket fall with which he could have been covered, but admitted that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his inner clothing or his scarves to hurt himself but that he had not done so.
Manning testified that that night they had removed their inner garments, glasses and glasses from their cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would take into account at least the experiences he had had during his stay in prison and dramatically reduced his sentence if he was convicted in the war council, which was expected to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other allegations considered too extreme.
The view is expected to resume this weekend and it is expected that prosecutors will argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application of any detainee who is under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, filtering of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could face a lifelong chain.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette notes that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had only come down by the planned and arrived in the immigration treatment area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two rows: one for "Mexicans" and the other for "foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Since I grew up in Central California, my whole life has been called "Mexican".
It's about ethnic tachography, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends as "Italian" themselves.
Later, I decided to "Mexico-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, the tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
It was simply American.
I speak Spanish. As well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda, as long as the leaders of these two countries meet, included immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexican remains in Mexico at this time as an adventure to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading block in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue to fight drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to the point of a gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that brings the least criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And Moctzuma's children are set up in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about hate?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living in, that is the American dream, not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans who belong to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
As you can see, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that there is this rock between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first people know who they are more solidly and the second ones this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-American people I know feel they're not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I learned during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised ambassadors of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with inequality of wages, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, friends.
That's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they must accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still reluctant to treat their families much less long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another drop in blood seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to trash; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything to them whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional boredom.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their fatal situation could be resolved.
A War That Is Not Lost or Winned
At first sight, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is kept high, this week's confrontations have strengthened the halons of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good strike.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and pressured the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous lands on the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic states of the Gulf, has also done so.
The proud Hamas members say that the Islamic mid-month is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Islamist party-military party is dominated, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of Muslim brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are the first brothers of Hamas and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may come out as a protagonist to which even Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, Hamas has been put in place.
The Israel Iron Cubule anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more quietly... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that runs across the West Bank, the main piece of a country that aspires to become a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite being illegal, according to international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined a group of an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, was in a good position.
Why do you piss off those retorted Palestinians giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their head.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That Mr. Morsi's pragmatic work with Barack Obama to achieve high fire is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is supposed to create dust that will one day exploit in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics is making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic pay.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that preaches sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this journal: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The short-term hope is that the high fire gives a little more impetus to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the establishment of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also played an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he neglected to submit his own plan for peace.
Once again in the White House, it seems as if it is reluctant to give your attention.
This attitude is a deplorable view of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.

The General Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a dark green, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of a green olive, a fantastic images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick of being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
This is the most strict regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia states that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the features that make this habit glamour.
It trusts studies that demonstrate that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99 per cent chances that he will never smoke.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how girls relate the crown's logo to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia had one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes would not have much impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries were considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"Legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by the falsifiers of China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited since the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone pitillaries and blankets to cover the unpleasant images of the coffins had been fired almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to majorist establishments and was waiting for more livelihoods.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is addressed.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to see cigarettes, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted to foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews on brands from "foot citizens" published on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is worth wondering whether it is just a private citizen who really loves the Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco from Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new legislation entails than marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is unfairly restricted, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO will issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that were considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
Currently they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, more stringent legislation is being considered.
In Australia many smokers prove challenging.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't care about them."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Creationally, there's only one reason I'd stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, says that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them in the barns.
"It usually took an hour to unwind a delivery; now it's four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's already, okay, we're done and we're closing the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a world that is constantly connected, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving parties, I had to spend five hours unexpectedly at an airport because the plane on which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Spend half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academic and child development experts who commend the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom with good courage?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, says, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" (“The boredom, an animated story”), published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not like this.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompey there are Latin graffiti on the boredom dating from the 1st century C.E.
We must also consider how to define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but unable, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
Note that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the change in the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".
Boring can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a question of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems focusing on ourselves.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups in the cont room heard a television program at all volumes that did not keep any relation, others heard it with the low volume, so it was only perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the volume below showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not to get bored."
"In fact, we now know that to move or make ties, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to combat it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are required to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is boring at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "threaty trend scale".
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I care that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and varied stimulation.
But in general, adolescents are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which 400 adolescents were contacted and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 per cent of adolescents said they would get bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 per cent said they would get bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would get bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boring percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest rates," largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.
So, coming back to my question of principle: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can make us exposed to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you see TV, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and gives you an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dose applies to other situations," he said.
Your child not only learns to stay alone but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the boredom.
But neither should we be too critical of him.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable paragraphs of the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire that is too distressing and disturbing as to relate it to something that is worth it," he says.
Note that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and football player in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove to Lamar, in the plains near the border of Kansas, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and soon Orozco received a judicial quote for possession of drugs and related articles (small offences involving each fine of $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of cases of lower drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes by possession of marijuana are being cancelled here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped presenting charges against the older than 21 years by small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has come into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with cases open to possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana shops in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licences; all this before the deadline comes on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead with most states regarding the regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Coloro has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model," he says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, entered into force on 6 December, which also leaves one year between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of doing cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"In no place will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On 21 November, Aurora police chief Oates sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing legal proceedings for minor misconduct by possession of marijuana to persons older than 21 years of age and that the police would stop reporting such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has a duty to bring judicial action against those offences that were committed at the time of the crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer calls adults for small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to reject any of the outstanding cases by possession.
"I don't think you're wasting your time doing the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the move, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
Contradictory reactions occurring throughout the state show a marked ambivalentity among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for possession of marijuana and is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've spent so much time bringing people to the courts that, in fact, they still can't accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington were preparing to become test cases at the national level regarding the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving information from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will surrender.
Although some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers have occurred for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed for the majority of marijuana sales businesses for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that anti-drug agents do not pull down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, reactions will likely be shown to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an excessive drug policy of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious federal problem," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in favour of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was accused of being a Tory until I got out of Oxford."
Do not attack university students for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't dreamed of getting a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the last two weeks of occupying my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the history career, I had already made the bags, which triggered the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had abandoned because it was not tolerated that some college partners had sexual relations in the room next door.
Writer A.N. Wilson announced that he had gone because I was forced to drink in uncooked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, not because I came from a private school.
I was accused for one reason, that in the corner of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was an outstanding advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on with that now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students are suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such that last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of graduate students) of the Corpus Christi College say they are "often seriously, personally attacked and treated as unthankless people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Its situation was not supported by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wanderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on students' policy and presented to the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Oxford University (UCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a silver suit and a bar with silver grip.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "turkheads" by introducing higher registration rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is an increasing trend of left at universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old historical student in Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "inconvenient", while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old and elected president of the OOCA, says that the attitude of the JCR members towards those who are in the right-wing centre has deteriorated.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, she was a young 18-year-old terribly shy.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honorous cause" after the cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The environment would have terrified any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students met and met the cathedrals, I received a sample of the bitterness I was expecting.
I found that the cathedrals not only made the fat sight of the ridicule of conservative university students, but they gladly participated in it.
The policy of strike by miners, privatization and opposition by the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first to attend was to translate the English French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Señorita Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I don't know one.
Pitt, a man down with a face that looked like a biscocoto, knew well how to drive out a bad car.
"Is it that the Dutchers refuse to learn French or are they simply stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with tears that I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy knowing people," Pitt said.
I went back to my room like a soul worth living.
That night I sat alone at dinner at the university; then I felt a light palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who was introduced as a member of the OOCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how things are.
They're dating anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many Tories recently arrived to appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly dissimulation.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student from Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned into the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"You give each other a stick, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have meaning before the Liberal Act of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
Tory's only open cathedral was Norman Stone, professor of Contemporary History, destined for my college.
They hated him because he was not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
He was just around there.
He hated the place where he considered it provincial and insignificant and his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began moving from Oxford to my parents ’ home in London every day, finding refuge in my more open metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar where another professor of History had insinuated, speaking seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "stupid old people."
The truce took little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my college career at Oxford.
That's why my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was in fear and, last five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When the suitcase was made and I took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me a weak tear.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, who has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party, but is now hiding behind a reputation that is not worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
Due to the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that gathers more than 130 high-dressing clothes created by his "house" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colphon of a story whose only protagonist is "the Signor" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinct customers.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the rusty and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of her social promotion: of humble modesty of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the icon of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't turn off the collars of their petillas on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful pop music celebrities," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimately forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the modest.
Many years ago, after a show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week of Paris in 1995.
"Never goes by fashion because their designs are works of art," he concludes.
Alcurnia Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade through the walkway to contemplate a "audit" of dream that lights Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Nette", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to the Farah Diba Empire.
In this audience of manikins there are names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" chalice and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, for he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors I use, they have great light and they're "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she saw a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of their nightwear...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with winged tails, "corsage" flagged and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made real," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her modest party clothes with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she carries".
The fashion "rey"
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modest man calls his hairdressers) to elaborate this marble silk suit with pearl incrustrations, twelve different matching types and a row of four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a hit from the late 20th century 'the return of the customers of the high society'.
Overcoming for years with the "savor-estre" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called my attention to his refinement, his calmness, his bright and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago in a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't go for him."
It's said by a princess...
The world's toughest trade: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
There are people whose work is one hell and another who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking the sulfur out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that flows from the inside of the Earth is solidified by contact with the air.
After starting out large sulphur rocks, which come to a total of about 70 kilos, they are carried in two bamboo baskets that load on their shoulders through paved stone paths.
They are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the worn-out carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb the tortoise, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to get back and fall through the precipitation.
They know that any miscarriage could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years at the risk of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euros for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, you open a step between the tourists who photographed them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiredly loading the heavy canasts, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then sell it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euros) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture beers, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily doors.
It takes three hours each and ends with mud, but it allows you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would gain in the field.
"The miner's newspaper is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167)," the carrier, who used to work as an Albanian on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut wasn't so hard, but then he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, was as overwhelming as the sulfur: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At 27 years of age, then he takes three playing the fight in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass him billing despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that release the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English language more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this young man could be a tourist guide, comrade or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden box with other carriers, it gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur doesn't stop operating at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenged by the shadows, then went down to the crater glowing with a little flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 wearers load the ashes on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its many benefits, the mining company has not mechanismd the extraction of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to the carriers, who work on their behalf and at both weight.
In fact, it does not even belong to the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of camera charging that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old supplier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 kilos, assures him that he will endure working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulphur burns the throat and selects the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases... beyond, it is clear, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and joints in the shoulders, that they have been misformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on your back, Unainik can already only load 50 kilos at its 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the malaise.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening her mouth well, where she has several teeth missing.
Of his five children, 30 years old and older, he also works with sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's toughest professions: the one that makes the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore search for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and believe in life!
It may seem inversely true that these verses are part of an announcement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a broom in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they will get to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people fulfill their "national duty".
This is something pure of the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What is not taken so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spends US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a refund rate - was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans no longer have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to address population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds only disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has a known effect on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
It admits, however, that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre that will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, and so is education, so many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to count on my own money and time," says another young man in his 20 ’ s.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, for so long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off-line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Real Academy Dictionary, this is about the quality of private life or "the scope of private life which is entitled to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a person under 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and to social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating online situations that would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", personally, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not raise them to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I lift beautiful images or games.
I'm also entertaining my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
Open Twitter to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'll just pick them up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone who recommended to a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter allows not to know 20 of the people added to their list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of your home or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it just the bag of my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not foreign to what is today known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailing him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the account.
"I just put privacy on him."
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would come up with pictures of strangers in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I get hurt or I'm hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a teacher in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, collected these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He notes that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or tell an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Even if they're selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what is privacy for children and adolescents is through questions that will make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do that on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When tags photos of parties, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they should act on line as they do off-line.
They're the same rules.
"A person outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, must be equal on social networks," he says.
Watch
Scholar Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an educational consultant, notes that it is essential that family parents read the policies of social networks consciously.
In understanding each of the intruders they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
Finalization of the Summit of Unasur without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven Assistant Plenipotentiaries.
Ef tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unashur, but sources of Chancellorship and Presidency indicated that it would be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information he circulated among reporters was delivered by press speakers from some of the governments of Unasur attending the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to be harassed for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the statement of Humala, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the Third Summit of South American Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insisted on by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration had not been disseminated.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure safe transmission systems for all journalists but limited access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling from the Hague Court which said a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CJC), which began Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will execute and enforce the sentence that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," said Humala, along with her Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," added Piñara, and greeted Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will submit to the IJC was then that Colombia would denounce this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had accepted to submit to the proceedings of that international court, after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the unrest of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The host, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after Lima's noon.
The representative read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries had been established for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He reported that actions are being pushed to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-price Internet access in all parts of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and brighten a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to prefer a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-roads of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate it into the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need to maintain Latin America as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting with his couple from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference respectfully after a CIJ failure, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional block.
"Suramérica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramérica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In that regard, it defended the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of Unashur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also expressed his support for the recompensation of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who had signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give the cathedral never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans have signed everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is under United States funding in Washington," said Julian Assange, in an allusion to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks.
Correa ensured that she was not repentant of that decision because she had not betrayed its principles but had respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process was not respected".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for demanding that it be interrogated in its territory for alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done since the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health is deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian official said.
What there is is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"That complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduit allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European institutions," he said.
And he said, "If Great Britain is going to save this tomorrow, this will end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits perfectly and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him through Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took advantage of to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and argued that what she did not tolerate is "the mediocreness, the bad faith and the lie that distorts freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, it was welcomed that these journalists were no longer "the bankers and the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it was further stated that the re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and coup d'état of legality" because it actually "distorted the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the "perfectly relevant" desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the Hague International Court of Justice, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That failure is not being achieved at the moment.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be widely processed to overcome them and to move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the maritime border dispute held in the same Peru and Chile court and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international forums if the two countries undertake to accept a hard case".
Referring to the possibility presented as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard".
Correa assured that if she loses the February 2013 commissions she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and we're out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he has travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, which was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if I had a bomb," it means remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make it "softer", with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness only and began to inform about it; with such effort that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV Unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after stating that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent of impact to the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with an count of 200 CDs4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CDs4.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives a positive diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, under these terms "while in control he can live without problems until the age of 75", the interviewer explained.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I don't think the problem is of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make early diagnosiss and therefore they have to offer mass detection evidence to all people who require it."
In his proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) also met the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to prove themselves to a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done so and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better come back three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take medication.
To date, his parents only know he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"Work, I have many activities, travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I care for myself and the other person," named Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILLENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who are afraid today, within the framework of World AIDS Day.
Let the test be done, if they have a risk, that they soon know if they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
This, its message, summarizes the AIDS battle slogan this year 2012.
Consonants after the display
There are great gaps between the health programmes and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a top journalist who has taken over the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that some people today still don't have access to a condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with hints and judgements of value for social workers, school leaders, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the indicators and these hundreds are in public bathroom despatches from the sites that young people frequent.
It is not motivated by promiscuity.
It is not a question of paying them the chairs and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be a condom distribution in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, the best thing is to approach condoms who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. Appeals Court a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario puts a bad precedent for any national company with branching in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in progress for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the Spladaraz to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bancarrots for the northern district of Texas leaves defenseless to Mexican firms in view of the possibility of embargoing their properties there in Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial tender in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was established, placing the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the inter-company, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial tender, the debts with its matrimonial branches of Vitro would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts were settled by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is that, while the votes of the subsidiaries remain, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, i.e. the "butter" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data ignores the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, Vitro was guilty of the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to the aftermath of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, taking the country's collections.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring a review to the court itself of appeals for the vote to be completed, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
Failure to prosper will result in the appeal of Cerciorere requiring the review of the trial by a higher court, in which case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The seriousness of the case is that the court covered a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, pointing out that it was committed to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramel: they hit Vitro and hit the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The balloon has been my life"
Trotamundos del baloncose Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years old when he was involved in the tablonic sport and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immigrated to the sport for more than 60 years, he was a player of lower categories, a player of the National Higher Balloons, captured and directed in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Baloncesto Federation.
"I put a lot of hats in the balloon through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The balloon has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorials that mark his wide journey, thus testify to it.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, the ones who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who remember their move for the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old, acting as co-authorized or taken over by the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether he was taken, co-authorized or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong 6"7 player for you."
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's beginning, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gaussian would have helped bring another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at the distance, because by 1988 it was already a federal mandate.
For that time I preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy's performances on the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the 1989 pre- Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the World of 1990, where we arrived fourth place and must have been bronze for not being that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final game for the second time," Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we made gold and gave it to the United States team, which was quite similar to what bronze won us in the world.
This team not only repeated Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 pre-Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitner in exchange for the players suspended by the Lio del Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculín did.
And that without counting his trajectories on the different leagues he played.
Who was the best fighter leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like Leo Arill's work very much.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and having up to 17 teams in one season in the early 1990s.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would have liked to implement, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too badly.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, officers and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
What I do most is listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
Dies the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he enlisted a man of unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil-magnetic predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communication provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her beloved city of Dallas, again representing the iconic role she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her journalist, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, kind and talented, and I'll make him very strange.
"He was an original person and lived life to the maximum," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor in his liver and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him in his home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedys who had been in the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included papers well received by the critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his master interpretation of the enchantingly hateful J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars at risk in betting houses.
He also helped to give the series a record of hearings at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million TV viewers tuned it and converted it to "Dallas" in the second most popular entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s cousin, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with a hooker unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a tricky businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Principal Victoria, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us, who have had the luck of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, he reported the chain.
There was immediately no statement by Warner or TNT about how the series would handle Hagman's loss.
From Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starized classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he married lawyer Ben Hagman in 1931.
He was lucky at the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he became a organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
Trying to offer some comfort, like "they're not afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but they'll be fine."
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unresistible ring: The end of the "large return account" of the Maya Calendar, December 21, to which many people have been seized as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what he expected in the next few months: the Hurricane Hurricane Sandy, a tax precipice that some have called "deburmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days old and counting, this has been a really good period.
And they remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could blow up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made a team to teach a course, entitled "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of re-submitting the course, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "emerging ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken in the evening of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"He sat down in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgeid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular, or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old graduate in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no interviewed student - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, last year's student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception to a superior authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment has been discussed, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or philosophy that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the light of the date.
Several said they were thinking about going to "to the end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
