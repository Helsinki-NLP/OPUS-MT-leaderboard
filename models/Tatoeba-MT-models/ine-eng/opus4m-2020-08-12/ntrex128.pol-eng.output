Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly there was a consternation, which is the effect of the proposal to change their title to the members of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament) in the short term MWP).
The idea arose in connection with plans to change the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the meeting from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of a kpin.
One of the parliamentarians from the Labour Party expressed concern about its grouping, saying that the new name is rife with the wave words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: the word "twp" means stupid and the word "pwp" means waste.
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party found that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
The member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the wave letter "w" is spoken similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently working on the draft bill amending the name, took the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will naturally be their own".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", which is WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
The members of the meeting propose alternative solutions. The difficulties in reaching a consensus are a disappointment for Elin Jones, the chairman of the meeting, who should present the draft law in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also take into account other changes in the way in which the assembly is carried out, including the rules for withdrawing members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their next title when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
In the coming week, the voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help resolve the ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The Government of Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a territorial claim and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Mr Ivanov, the President of Macedonia and the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that the results of the vote were being disregarded.
However, plebiscite voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary in order to enable the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Calling in the New York Church of St. Marcina will be silenced due to problems encountered by churches in Harlemia
"The older people I'm talking to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner before," Michael Henry Adams said.
"There's no trace of them at all."
According to him, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Currently, people give their company in a different way," he noted.
"The Bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of the members of the community".
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the assets from the sale of the property are not sufficient for the time being considered by the decision-makers and that “they will be in the point of departure sooner or later”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments inhabited by people who would not support the rest of the surrounding sanctuaries.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people buying houses in such buildings will be white people, and this will speed up the total closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by the gathering of white believers, before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community a decade later).
The initial gathering of white Methodists left the region in the 1930 ’ s.
At that time, the Afro-Americans had the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a meeting under the leadership of the magnificent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th street vendors (the main trade street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or advancement of African Americans.
The 1939 fire damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s parafiscal plans were made to rebuild the temple and repair the building of the bell team.
Blessed David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Marcina's church, proudly called the new carilion "the poor calls".
The expert who rang the bell in July described them in a different way: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also observed that this is the first carilion in the world supported by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's church did not replace him.
In recent months in St. Marcina's church, a number of complex events involving architects and performers have taken place. Some of them were conducted by the clergy of the church, and some were the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Parafial Council (the parafia managing body composed of the Church leaders) addressed its concerns, saying that "it wants to transfer costs to the Council", although the Council did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent to the place.
Part of the paraffin also complains about the lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Rekin injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning for about half an hour he dived with his friends when he heard a call for help. Immediately with a group of friends they sailed to the boy to help him pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited by the homer’s capture, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I’m being bullied!
I've been bitten!"
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around the perimeter.
"I began to cry out to everyone to escape the water: "There is a river in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Children's Hospital in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had already been observed a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the thigh.
In order to conduct the investigation and for reasons of safety, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noticed that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's network plans to expand its activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network throws a glove at shops such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing cosmetic works that are stylish to the goods house, as well as specially trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetic market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly developing despite the downturns in the fashion industry and the household goods, there will be more regulation in 11 online shops with cosmetic products.
The return to the cosmetic industry results from the search for ways to manage the area previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network doubles the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3,000 items. In the range for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees products also receive more places and separate areas similar to these well-known Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products for making Boutique. From now on, most of the articles will be friendly to the vegan, which is increasingly required by young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in the southern part of London, and the second will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the later period of the year.
The frequency of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will be more and more recalling goods houses, because the network is trying to fight discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos's network points in hundreds of shops and has introduced a number of Habitat's network points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food items and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganise cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has ended with a defeat.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company from Boots. However, the cooperation was completed as a result of a conflict between the distribution of revenues from pharmaceuticals operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 patents by Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for $125 million three years ago.
According to Lloyds report, it will contribute to the plan by introducing an extended luxury brand offer for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and nature of cosmetics works to improve customer impressions.
We have invested in special training for employees to help consumers during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and a friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the way in which they are making purchases."
Peter Jones "fighted" after Holly Willoughby resigned from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Dan TV program, was "fighting" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from worth 11 million pounds of his lifestyle brand to focus on newly linked cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand offering accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through Instagram.
An urgent decision to leave the successful lifestyle brand and focus on the newly associated collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby has aroused Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "fighting", when a popular television shower announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting in his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds there will be no time to dedicate their March offering accessories and household articles to Truly.
The company was previously compared to the Gwynet Paltrow Goop brand. It also had to double Holly Willoughby's worth 11 million pounds.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave the brand Truly by Holly Willoughby 37 years old at Instagram Peter Jones left the United Kingdom, returning to one of his summer houses.
Says the source: “Marka Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to her and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In the Marlow Store, the goods are ready for sale."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation and one of the biggest success stars in the UK can cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products, including accessories from candles for clothing and household goods, and will also lead to further delays in market entry.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years have maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp set up Truly in 2016 and Peter Jones, 52 years old, joined them in March as president.
Couples spent their holidays together, and Jones included 40% of the shares in the television production of Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the owner of the I'm A Celebrity program at the ITV station.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The President joked at the criticism of the media caused by the attention that some considered to be "a failed husband", as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump submit so much?
Trump said in a hilarious voice, saying to the TV shower:
"I didn't give up."
The president noted that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "analogue response" from the United States to the early activities of North Korea aimed at disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Unem had had a positive effect: they led to the completion of missile tests, helped free hostages and return to the rest of the American soldiers at home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking to Kim Dzong Un.
"It is easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing out with a finger to the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia have wreaked havoc on one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of Lombok's population, the authorities have not announced food disasters, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support. The situation is therefore difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Food Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pala, to see whether international organisations should be allowed to help.
In the face of the constant shocks in Indonesia, the country is completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although in the province of Aceh the shelters have been built in case of tsunamis, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastline.
The absence of any siren warning against the tsunamis in Paul, despite the warning, was likely affecting the number of victims.
Even under the most favourable conditions, the journey between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Food bubbles make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on Lombok Island, goes with the help of the victims of earthquakes in the city of Palu. However, reach the goal will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesian infrastructure as the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds on the roads and railway lines.
However, in the face of future elections, the administration of the President shall be in a position to deal with the lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure from the country's religious-based tension. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people have died, and tens of thousands of people have lost their roof as a result of the struggles between Christian gangs and Muslims using machetes, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge gets a discount gate in the game from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss from Chelsea in the English Premier League, winning the 89-minute Saturday game played at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a dose from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate at 1:0 to the detriment of his team.
Before giving a shot in the direction of the remote gate, he put the ball on his left leg.
The ball pushed high above the penal field towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she entered the gate, leaping over the falling Kepa Arizabalaga.
“I just tried to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to take it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot”, Sturridge said in an interview for the LiverpoolFC.com service.
"I noticed the coming Kante, I took the ball and gave the shot without any further thought."
Chelsea ran 1:0 in half of the match after the Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Celestial Attacker pushed the fifth ball to Mateo Kovacitia and then ran towards half Liverpool.
Kwačić quickly accepted the injection in the middle of the thigh.
Then he made a beautiful play on the front in the courtroom with a return to Hazard.
Hazard led the defenders and left footed in the direction of a long column of arrows, which passed through the lifeline of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will compete with the Naples Club in the team phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton at the UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832 people
As reported by the Indonesian Food Disaster Agency on Sunday morning, the number of recent earthquake and tsunami victims in that country increased to 832.
During the conference, the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported that as a result of the Friday earthquake, a total of 7.5 degrees in Richter's scale, many people were imprisoned under the rubble.
The city of Palu, inhabited by more than 380 thousand people, is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's memory before the British Parliament's last victim in the dispute about "writing history again"
Removing the monument would bring justice to the Taliban's recollection of the destruction of many English cultural and religious forgetfulnesss by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to write history again".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Since the ongoing debate on the elimination of monuments was a matter of time before the Westminster Palace, the issue of the status of Oliver Cromwell was a matter of debate.
The illustrative actions during the English domestic wars were neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe because of the actions of his forefather Thomas centuries ago he was determined not to punish Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the Memorial shows how this policy was welcomed in the 19th century and that for many it is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “By many people Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than at present – as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, of course, in this case the monarchy.
The assessment of the relevance of this finding is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as the Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and remembered."
In China, there has been a fatal disturbance of the farmer by the pig
According to local media, a deadly attack of pigs on the farmer occurred at a trade fair in the south-west of China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a cut artery near the creek at the shop in Liapanshui, in the province of Kuiczou.
The pig trapper prepares to carry out vaccinations in the dam on 30 May 2005, the city of Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
According to the report, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found a man's body and noticed an open door to the nearby well.
He said there was a large blood request in the bread.
The tissue section confirmed that it was about 250 kilograms of pigs that were fatally disturbed by the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and directed," said a man named Wu quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The materials from the surveillance camera show that Yuan came to the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that during the gathering of evidence by the police, the request was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the family of men and the trading authorities negotiate compensation for death.
In the past, cases of swine fever have been reported in humans, although they are rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal injuries.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about 300 kilograms of pigs drove the farmer to the tractor, and the man's wife was able to pull the animal.
After eating a pig farmer from Oregon in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told the CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood may lead to brutal behaviour.
"They just want to have fun.
They're so interested in nothing... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains after the storm of Rose cause heavy rainfall in the south-west part of the United States
According to estimates, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, heavy rains in northern Mexico and the south-western part of the United States are causing heavy rains.
Huragan Rosa runs at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 east time he was given category 1. He was then 620 km south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast, on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, it is beginning to form as it is heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the mass of wet air to the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in parts of the territory of Mexico.
In the next few days, wet tropical weather facing the coming down will lead to heavy rains in the South West of the United States.
In some places the rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, displacement of pollution and possible precipitation in desert areas.
Vulnerable tropical air causes falls from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour anywhere. This is particularly true of parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even from 5 to 10 cm of rain is foreseen in some South West areas of the United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical falls, sudden floods and severe changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, we are strongly advised to move on foot to the desert.
Clouds of tides can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms with storms can cause local storm winds and dust movement.
It's coming before it's gonna bring overloads of local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
Rains of a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small movements of pollution and road hazards.
It would be the first rainfall in this rainy season in the region.
The tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday the rainfall will occur on a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, the rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and last until Wednesday.
In October with cooling in the Arctic region in the whole of the United States, temperatures may fluctuate. However, in the intervertebral zone there will be more heat.
It can lead to severe temperature changes at small distances.
A good example are the weekly temperature differences in the central part of the States.
The differences between Kansas City (stan Missouri) and Omaha (stan Nebraska) and St Louis (stan Missouri) and Des Moines (stan Iowa) are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, summer temperatures may again increase.
In much of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to warm early October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the north-east.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of temperatures occurring above the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people were watching six television stations involving Thursday's hearing of candidates at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980's.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regular programmes to inform about the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the senate judicial committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had observed her in a state of ignorance and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said, however, that he was convinced that such a situation did not take place.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even higher than that given by Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of TV stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, figures have not yet been available.
In addition, Nielsen tends to have difficulty measuring the visibility of people at work.
The number given is similar to the viewing of the American football Cup games or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to a report by Nielsen Fox News Channel, whose representatives strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, she had the highest visibility. She had an average of 5.69 million views during the interview.
On the other hand, there was a 3.26 million sights ABC station.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key feature of Friday's events.
In the morning he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the recording, he screamed at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to get into the elevator in the hearing of the Judicial Commission.
Flake with her head down for a few minutes was listening to the unmistakable opinions, and the whole event was broadcast by CNN.
"I'm standing here before you and asking questions.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have the strength in the face of so many women" – he heard from the demonstration woman.
Before closing the lift door, Jeff Flake said his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the commission hearing.
Later television stations continued to broadcast events awaiting a vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate.
Flake said he only supported the nomination when he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, which the minority of Democrats were charged with.
Flake was convinced after some conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republic would not have the votes required to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated the FBI proceedings on the charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit of using it for its own good
In a weekly survey, the Prime Minister of Theresa May accused the European Union of criticising its abandonment plan for the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In addition to this report, the Foreign Minister of her Government, Boris Johnson, who presented Theresa May on the title page, attacked the plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU could take the duty on its behalf, calling it "totally insane".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Diteon Simpson suspect of LSU's murder
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the colors of the State of Louisiana (LSU).
According to a report by the police in Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and put in custody under a second-degree murder charge.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS-related station WAFB police officers found these glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson DNA on them.
The police informed Simpson that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
As the detainee reported, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued an initial report that led to the death of the head and neck.
The police command expressed thanks to the State Police Search Group, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the nearby residents for helping in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Aleva, director of LSU sports, thanked the local authorities for their "workability and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A measuring 198 cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball in LSU.
In his last season, he scored on average 5,6 points and 2,6 games.
On Friday morning, basketball coach from LSU Will Wade said that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde.
"It's one of the things we're always afraid of," said Will Wade.
Dust emitted by the volcano reaches Mexico City
The dust from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the national food disaster prevention centre restored the inhabitants of Mexico to the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre has noted numerous riots and shocks.
Published in social media, the pictures show the front wheels of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in the areas of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the earthquake of 7,1 degrees, which occurred in Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
First police officers with Catalan separatists before the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of older demonstrators supporting Catalonia's independence with preventive police forces. That day thousands took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the upcoming referendum on the Catalan session.
The group of masked separators cast eggs and powder by police officers. The dark dust clouds usually took off the streets full of tourists.
It also came to an old age in the later part of the day. In order to stop the fight, the police used a stick.
For a few hours, the group supporting independence scandals “We do not forget, we do not forgive”. The opponents of the session shouted “Let Spain live”.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people received medical attention due to minor injuries caused during the protests.
After a year since the October 1 referendum, tension is not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid have considered them illegal, there is still reason to celebrate for the desired sessions of the Catalans.
The majority voted for independence, but the frequency was low due to the wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people suffered injuries last year in brutal olds with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday night, a group of supporters of the independence of the region decided to prevent demonstrations supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, but a change of course was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence anymore.
“Last year we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we are stuck in the point of no exit," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the supporters of the Catalan session have difficulty continuing. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to leave or await the arrest in connection with the role played in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old telephone-protesting police-supported mechanic, said politicians on both sides of the dispute are inciting conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced the will to start in future elections to the European Parliament.
"Admission to the European Parliament in elections is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested several times as a result of a car crash in the Londonderry home.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 a.m. British Time (BST).
Commissioner of Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At a certain point in the direction of the car, a shot could also be given from a piece.
The Mengi Gate ensures the victory of Livingstone over the Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingstone was to win the team
From this season on, Livingston Club Extraclusters made Rangers in isolation, giving Steven Gerard a second defeat in his 18 matches in the position of the Ibrox Park Club Coach.
The door of Dolly Mengi proved victorious, and Gary Holt's team moved elsewhere in a table occupied with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team remains unvicieved in this season at the Premiership. The team will meet with Hearts leader next Sunday, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier, because already on Thursday, the Rangers will be visiting the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA European League.
Livingston is extending the series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt didn't fail to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed a few occasions against undisposed opponents
The team run by Holta should have been running a lot earlier, as the team game has contributed to the range of problems.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot himself in the light of the gate, but he couldn't shoot the goal.
The masters allowed the Rangers to play near the gate, knowing that they could endanger the rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's the way a decisive gate fell.
After the release by the Rangers of the free team Livingston found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendza, who won a goal from within the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they could not force the defences of the economy and did not make any more problems for Liam Kelly.
This scheme was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's door.
Scott Pittman's sample was gunned down by Allan McGregor's Rangers' locker, and Lithgow couldn't get into the light of the next permanent fragment for Livingstone.
The Rangers continued attacks in the court of Livingston, but could not take advantage of the situation. Two executions were demanded after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton's variable and one hand played.
"The Phenomenal" speech of Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingstone.
In his opinion, they played a great game, again and again, beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost did not change from going back to the extraclass. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a great organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worall very careful throughout the match.
The range is too large for the fight.
Although they have great moments under Gerard's leadership, they have not maintained their standards in the match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once did they get through the defense of the economy. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to the Colony
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of the upcoming controversy of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, and visits aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After meeting Erdogan, he went to the Colony, where he opened a new, huge match.
In this town, the largest number of Turks live outside their homeland.
As the police indicated, for security reasons, a 25-mile crowd gathered in front of the sanctuary was blocked, but the president's electors gathered around to see their leader.
The hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions that prompted the visit of the policy called by the hero by part of the Turks living in Germany and regarded as autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker died as a result of a car crash
The driver was killed by a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the busy crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British Time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle and the rescuers arrived.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a bicycle occurred on the street of Children Street (a distance of about half a mile from the site of the Saturday accident).
Metro police have reported that officials are working on identifying a dead man and informing him of the occurrence of family members.
Roads closed and bus tours organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin: Six officials reported injuries as a result of confusion
According to the authorities of the premises, six officials reported injuries as a result of interference in the penal facility for men with high level of safety.
The HMP Long Lartin penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) and continues.
A special unit called "Tornado" was called the eight prisoners in one of the wing of the facility.
On-the-spot officials reported minor facial injuries.
“ Specially trained personnel were involved in the operation of the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officials reported minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our institutions, we are convinced that the responsible people will be sent to the police and can spend more time in prison."
The HMP Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to a report in June, the head of the establishment had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October of last year, prevention forces were called to the facility because of the dangerous confusion in which workers were attacked by ballad bullets.
The sudden floods caused by the Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial effects on areas covered by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression will reach the state of Arizona. It is likely that it will occur at the beginning of next week. The remains after the storm of Rose move along the desert plains of the South West, creating a threat of sudden successes.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the possibility of early hits on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to a forecast Tuesday, Rosa will cross Phoenix directly. On Monday afternoon, rainfalls will begin.
National Weather Service in Phoenix reported through Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression 320 km away from Phoenix.
Huragan Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona state border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict falls from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach up to 15 cm.
In the rest of the desert areas of the South West, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Kotlin, the rainfall will probably range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside areas at risk of sudden precipitation associated with Hurricane Rosa may be relieved because the region has been fighting drought for some time.
Although the floods are a serious threat, part of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where droughts prevail.
As the weather.com portal reports, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of Arizona's area competes with the affected droughts that belong to the second of the highest categories.
Huragan Rosa arrives first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to move with Hurricane strength, reaching speeds up to 137 km/h. She is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at speeds 19 km/h.
Hurragan is pumping colder waters into the Pacific Ocean, causing its weakening.
It is estimated that it will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfalls in some parts of Mexico may pose a major challenge.
The weather.com portal has said that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the north-west part of the state of Sonora, falls from 7 to 15 cm, although they can reach 25 cm”.
Then the Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. On Tuesday evening it will catch up to the southern part of Utah state.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is the very abundant rainfall in the California Peninsula, in the north-west part of Sonor state and in the south-west desert areas of the United States," National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that the rains cause life-threatening floods and pollution in the desert and muddy lavas in the mountainous area.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on the charge of attempted murder of a 16-year-old found wounded in the county of Somerset.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, about 4:00 p.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital, and her condition remains "stable".
As the Avon and Somerset police report, one 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested at night around Radstock.
Officials ask for contact with all persons who have access to records of the event.
Trump stated that Brett Kavanaugh "found the bottom line and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugha is a vote against the indisputable and repulsive proceedings of the Democratic Party," said Trump for a century in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "recognised the hypocrisy and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the convention. He firmly and emotionally denied the charges against Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago when they were both teenagers, the man allowed himself to be sexually assaulted against her.
Ford also testified during the hearings on the allegations made by her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "Americans could be convinced of the brilliance, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support from one of the most remarkable lawyers of our time, the law-teacher of great social merit," he said in front of the crowd of voters forever in Western Virginia.
The President did not simply refer to the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in the case of half the Presidency of the elections.
“We are divided by five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
I do not start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I continue to fight to defend our great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are developing a policy of "resistance and difficulties".
As one of the assistants of the Republican Party's important policy told CNN, the first key Senate vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
As reported by the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died – many of which were kidnapped by high waves breaking through the beach – as a result of a severe earthquake of land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the beach to take part in the festival city. On the way to the beach they hit waves of up to six meters high, taking many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis were the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat occurred yesterday, the people staying on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to tsunamis," said at a conference in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian food disaster agency BNPD.
"The Tsunami attacked everything on their way, taking cars, clouds and houses," he brought Nugroho. Then he added that before reaching the shoreline, the food moved to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them were saving their lives by climbing the trees.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and damaged bridges and water-covered swords are seen in the aerial photos published by the food disaster agency.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, there were a number of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the widespread fifth earthquake of the earth was about two times as much as the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement found that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, could have been affected by tsunamis.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that the impact lay hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He then added that the bodies of the victims were found under fallen buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
Nugroho said that fatal victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Pala, in the area called Dondala, which was near the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugroho, the communication "was completely paralysed", which is why there are no reports from the province of Dondala.
“There are more than 300 thousand people” — you can read in the Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteer organisations go to places affected by the disaster.
"Now we can talk about tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," said the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism due to the lack of information about the impact of the tsunamis in Palu. However, the authorities reported that the waves had come immediately after the warning was issued.
On the amateur video available in the social media, you see a man screaming out of the building trying to warn about the coming tsunamis of the person on the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall broke down on the shore, robbing buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Earth and tsunami earthquakes have caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, making it impossible to communicate within the Pala, which in turn has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to the military, transport aircraft were launched using Jakarta and other cities, but people evacuated still very much need food and other basic items of the first need.
The airport located in the city is open only for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for people evacuated in Pala.
Over 800 victims of tsunamis in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As did Doseb T. Sinai, Director of the World Vision, the staff arrived safely from the province of Dondgal to the city of Palu and found shelter in the homes of the homeless in the area of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although part of the groups is slowly beginning to carry out aid, there has been criticism that the travel to Paul is impossible for foreign humanitarian workers with a wealth of experience.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and personnel abroad can be initiated only after the national disaster site has been declared.
It's not done right now.
"We are still officially dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian spokesman for the Red Cross.
"When the government considers that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not happened yet."
After two days of the fifth earthquake and tsunami in Paul’s palace, friends and families of those who have died are still alive, hoping that their loved ones will find some miracle among the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paralysis team, trained two missing paralytics participating in this month's Asian games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other prisoners at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced pilot, I am coping with my own emotional burden," he announced.
Gendon Subandano told us that within a few hours of the arrival of the satellite community information about the crash of Roa Roa Hotel was desperately sent by the WhatsApp communiqué to athletes taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked only by one gray hook instead of a pair of black hooks.
"It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26 750 USD while filling cash in ATM at Newport on the Levee
According to a police command message in Newport, on Friday morning the thieves stole 26 750 USD from a worker in Brink, who added cash to the ATM at Newport's trading center on the Levee.
"The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to fill the cash," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a published communication.
Another man "run from the back to Brink's employee" and stole a purse with money to the ATM.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not report how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thief are asked to contact the police in Newport under number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
As he announced his intention to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself, "A person known earlier as Kanye West".
The 40-year-old music has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change occurred before a visit to the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that during the artist's performance he will present his new album pt. Yandhi.
He will be replaced by the artist Ariana Grande, who, according to the authors, has given up "for emotional reasons".
The West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only short of his present artistic home, but is of religious significance.
"It seems to me that "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Holy Scriptures it means "Ty"," said West in an earlier period of the year, talking about the title of the album with a radio presentation about the pseudonyms of Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
First, I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – reflecting all of our good, bad and embellished traits.
The album shows us who we are."
West was in the midst of other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West collaborator, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with the connector, without the connector and with large letters.
Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador undertakes not to use military against civilians
In the pre-50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty years of the student demonstration, the President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) committed himself never to using the military against civilians.
On Saturday at the place of Three Cultures López Obrador promised "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened at a time when left movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people living in Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance to students, as well as by creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities for young people towards criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of research on artificial intelligence
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and an artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple groups, along with an increase in Chinese activity in this area of the United States should double the cost of research in the field of SI.
Attention is drawn to the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various government agencies in the United States, although the United States does not have an official SI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan that by 2030 they wanted to be the most innovative state in the field of artificial intelligence.
"At first, we have to double the budget for research on SI: all the other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In his report this week, the CNBC also said that double funding could double the chances of further breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of the company Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China, known as Face++.
In the 1980s Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University for the creation of the SI system, which won the best American player in the game Othello. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee has recognized the success of previous US government technology initiatives, such as the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the Field of Defence (DARPA) competition for the most interesting work projects. He has also asked the question about the deadline for the next edition of the competition, because he thinks it will help him find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to make great efforts to obtain government grants.
"It's not China that we get the best representatives of academic environments, but corporations," Lee said.
For a few years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I think that people with artificial intelligence who have achieved a doctor's degree in science should automatically admit a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the artificial intelligence of the next generation.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Science Foundation (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of the academic institutions in a way similar to the American National Foundation of Science and other government organizations that recognise American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense launched a Joint artificial intelligence centre, which will be involved in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the creation of a special commission for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA also reported an allocation of USD 2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing over USD 100 billion annually in the study on SI.
At the same time, the American initiative to create the National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward from month to month.
Macedonians vote in referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in the referendum on the change of name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow for a few decades' fight with Greece, which is blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and therefore called upon the country to join the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the title, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority living in Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the frequency would reach the minimum level of 50% required for the referendum to be binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU as a result of the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say that it is worth paying the price for joining Macedonia – one of the countries that has emerged since the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. The EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver of Georgia from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament's members.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no unusual events have been reported by 13 o'clock.
However, this hour's frequency was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016. At that time, 66% of the people in power voted.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanevski, an elector from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in a referendum on the change of name of the country to open the way to membership of NATO and the European Union.
Prior to the building of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set chairs in front of the tents distributed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with a head cut, not back door," Kawardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, at which the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will talk about changing the name of the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He stated that the vote on 'yes' was a 'confirmation of our future'.
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in Sunday's referendum, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote.
70% of the respondents said they supported the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The defeat of the referendum would be the first major part of the policy of the Western government since the fall of power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City defeats Brighton's entire defense and wins the gate
Sergio Aguero and Rahe Sterling sent to the house the defense of Brighton at a Saturday meeting of 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was played at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The door opened by Aguera in 65 minutes seemed childishly easy.
The action began with the use of a cane in the middle of the Argentine attacker.
The footballer chased three of Brighton's defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four Brighton racers.
First, he grabbed one of them and then chased the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English attacker immediately gave the ball back to Aguera in the criminal field, which beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's locker shot to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero fights the strike," Coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
We were lucky he got the door at the time."
However, Sterling provided a blue first single lead in the Premier League.
The door he's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero got a ball deep in half Brighton.
He sent a great injection to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant column.
The attacker of Manchester City directed the ball to the net just before she got out of the car.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim in the UEFA Team on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning Rockies
After losing his chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer, he didn't have to take the lead.
However, the loving rivalry of Scherzer hopes to take place in Sunday's meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies retains the chance to perform in the play-off phase. Currently the team has one win more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
Rockies can count at least on a wild card if they win a fifth meeting against the Nationals result 5:2. However, they still want to get their first title of the division master.
“Although we’re playing nothing, at least we’re going to go out on the battlefield, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the presence of opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why shouldn't I take part in this meeting?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the start date for the Sunday meeting. However, the team tends to expose Scherzer in the first composition.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth performance in the first composition.
The right-hand team swimmer from Washington records the results 18-7 and ERA 2.53. 300 times eliminated the bats and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not simply refer to his appointment to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the frequency of Republicans in the case of half the election presidency.
"In November, we are making all the achievements that have been achieved.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are divided into five weeks.
Although I don't get started, I'm still very active, and I'm always defending our great candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We have to deal with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to take power by all possible means, they are vile and evil.
They do not care who is injured, and they have to be wronged in order to gain power and control; this is their goal, and We do not give them that.
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of "resistance and difficulty in the work".
"It has been very good to see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad, mean, unpleasant and unfair".
The president referred to the Senate Judicial Commission, calling on the name and name of the American senator from the Democratic Party of Diana Feinstein, which met with the crowd's loud applause.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak of the document?
"Uh, listen?
Her body was fatal, it was the worst body I've ever seen."
The Working Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant to those who express their own views
When the members of the Momentum organization in my party voted for my bribe, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Working Party, who have been told recently that they are not well-known, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the application for bribery was based on differences of opinion between me and Jeremy Corby.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and, like the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders in these matters.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of parliamentarians of the Working Party from the Nottingham East, it was possible to read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years I have served as a Ambassador to the Working Party most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee seemed that way.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place differently, and the promises of a "more hearty and gentler" policy have long been forgotten as they have ever been remembered.
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Working Party. Each opinion is assessed in compliance with the party's leadership.
It all began soon after the position of President of Jeremy Corbyn began, and colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change my direction and take positions that I would not agree with before, and they were concerned with issues such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public talk, regardless of the content, I am faced in the social media with attacks that call for nomination, deploration or abandonment of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the attention I give to my address is rather political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexual or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to a daily agenda with injuries to others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Working Party should support a culture of tolerance.
We are, in fact, no longer a group of people with different views, with every proposal for "voice of distrust" and every change in the rules of choice of the party's world view is bound up.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to fall back on certain issues and then everything would be "okay".
But that's not why I've taken care of politics.
Since joining the Working Party 32 years ago, as a result of Margaret Thatcher's neglect, which has led to the breakdown of my school class, I am trying to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need, as well as the local councillor and minister.
I've never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East district knew my position and knew about the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported the fifth proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the wishes of wasting time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the president of the lab in the face of Brexit, which will harm the household, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both the members of the Working Party and the others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat to the withdrawal of the nomination or the practical political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with their beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Air vs. Melrose 38:17 – Unbeatable Air again on the top
Two late applications could have caused a final result. However, there is no doubt that the Air team has won this extremely interesting match of the Scottish extraliga.
The team was first placed in the table and remains the only unmanned team.
Finally, the distinctive defense and better use of the opportunity led the team of the economy to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his subordinates.
"The current games have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeatable, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We need to pay tribute to the Air racers. They used the opportunity to show up better than we did”.
Air left for the 14th minute after Grant Anderson and Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to balance the result when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused chance of climbing.
The climate increased Air's driving after being thrown out of prison just before the end of the first half. First he got the application, and then he took the chance to raise, getting the score 17:5 for Air.
Melrose well started the second half. Patrick Anderson's application raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then the game was stopped for a long time because of the serious conjugation of Ruaridh Knott. The contestant was removed from the noose. After the restoration, Air increased the driving after the application of Stafford McDowall and the raising of the climate.
The captain of the Air Blair Macpherson team has received a yellow card. Melrose has again taken advantage of his number: the use of an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin has reduced driving.
The owners took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for crashing the climate without a ball. MacPherson got a fit on his back of the approaching defense.
The climate took advantage of the opportunity to raise, and then he was able to increase the result right after the game was resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the executioner and enabled winged Gregor Henry to get the fifth application for the economy.
The Still Game series star starts a career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of the restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis at the popular BBC station site. He performs and co-sponsored the series together with his multi-year comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the next nine seasons will be the last in the series history.
According to official data, he was the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, although the informant of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the "developmental gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The Sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the Bolivian Sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the base of the military in La Paz.
There are blue flags coming from public buildings.
“ The sea is ours under the law, ” says the U.S. Navy of Lake Titicaca.
His recovery is our duty."
In the absence of access to the Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century stock conflict is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps the largest of several decades. Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's judgment. It is due to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are disuniting. The residents are one-minded, optimistically set up and regarded as a beneficial virtue," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will jointly attend the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that the organization with headquarters in The Hague will recognise Bolivia's claim and after decades of non-profit talks Chile will have to join the negotiations on granting independent access to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will be the next year's debate on the re-election struggle, also gives hope in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a positive decision for Bolivia are small and that even an appealing decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office at Headquarters does not have the power to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also noted that it will not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Zárate said, the Chilean expert on international law, the International Court of Justice's decision will be issued six months after the submission of final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its goal for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been initiated by the current Bolivian administration," said Paz Zárate.
The inescapable rhetoric of Morales has deprived the Chileans of any remnant of good will, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the present situation.
In the case of both countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree with the view that the decision-making process was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relation to relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end the 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — was using access to the sea as an element of political play.
"The pain never departs from the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to cope with the past."
North Koreans claim that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments appeared at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be at the end of the suspension of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri claims that "frozen" is as if there was no lifting of sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign a declaration without prior taking concrete disarmament steps by Pjongang.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjonjang is seriously addressing the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security-guaranteed measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows indicate the appearance of the newest big lines to cover their heads in clothing shops.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, we have good information for you.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's fashion designers presented a series of crazy, over-the-counters covering their summer collection for the year 2019, which styled during the Paris Fashion Week fashion week.
The unusually unpractice hats were on Instagram this year. Those designers decided to present their insane creations on the run.
The distinguished work of Valentino was a huge bee hat decorated with a wide, purple round flowing head models.
Other oversized accessories included ambers decorated with gemstones, magic hat, and even pineapple — but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of personal masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many colored masks had a covered mouth and reminded Hannibal Lecter more style than high couture.
One creation reminded the equipment to dive with the tube and the glasses, and the other looked like dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that huge hats can reach clothing stores.
Uncumbered hats follow directly to La Bomba, a broken hat with a width of 61 cm, all of which were already wearing – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand behind this unusually impractical hat, which passed through the social media, presented another great creation — a fragile beach bag almost as large as the model worn in the bathroom suit.
The roasted orange bag of raffia, finished with raffia frogs and decorated with a white leather handle, was distinguished in the collection Jacquemus La Riviera for the 2019 season during the fashion week of Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, said FEMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in shops the following year — because the designer has succeeded in making such an impact, it would be difficult not to use the demand for superfluous accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills required for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018 they were able to praise the results of further remarkable exams, individual support and collective success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
The schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) with over 30,000 students throughout Scotland aim to provide the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, which they have chosen career paths and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a school-friendly learning programme, we see that innovative languages are still popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another person in a language he understands, then it will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages take the lead in league rankings, with the highest rates of distance in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages gained a higher rating of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received a higher A rating in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, language learning, such as subjects for selection, is carried out in the same extent as that of STEM subjects (strict sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the framework of teaching programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
The 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that the lack of language skills of candidates was 17 per cent due to difficulties in job vacancies.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for the start of a career.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong skill, such as learning another language, will provide a tremendous advantage in the future, regardless of the course of professional development.
The possibility of a direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adult British people participated, 75% of them were unable to speak in a foreign language for good, and the French language was the only language whose percentage of people using was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding appropriate employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classic innovative languages, while others will learn the languages they consider to be the most important for Great Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interest, there will always be many languages in independent schools to be taught by specialised teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, business languages still play a key role in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
New languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a large choice, diversity and level.
That's just the way it is.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James debut in Los Angeles Lakers finally met.
Luke Walton, Coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James was playing a Sunday pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one but less than 48", Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
The team reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James is probably playing a incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to participate in pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Selective Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of elections tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia.
This is the first of five of the polls planned by the Trump, which will take place next week, along with positions in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with the vote confirming the suspension of his election to hold his office in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support in the upcoming elections in the government half-way, as the Republics may be threatened with a loss of control over Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is it going to be tonight? What time is it going to be?
The election of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
The West Virginia Trump election event will be followed live by the Internet in the YouTube service.
Trump will probably talk about the weekly hearings of the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the expected vote in the Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum of one week, during the FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral elections is to support the Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
So President Trump's five-week campaign next week is aimed at "mobilising volunteers and volunteers to assist Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives" — Reuters.
"Congression is such an important point in the President's timetable that as the hottest season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," said Trump's campaign spokesperson, who did not agree to his name — Reuters.
Today's election at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey who is losing in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Team shows the spirit of fighting, keeping hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the foursome format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The collapsing gap is a completely invented sport concept, but one in which athletes really believe, and the most in such races as these.
So what's their difference at this point?
"They've run six points, and now they've only run four, so I think we have a little distraction," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has four points, while it is still twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel the wind in their jugs and have worthy examples to imitate, especially in the form of Spieta and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could be commended for getting three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
The screams on the whole throat that was a sign of excitement became louder during his round, hiding the key pot and winning the match when he and Thomas got two sticks in two blows.
His reflection on the land that won them with the result of 15, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still at stake.
"It is enough to focus and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these athletes.
18 bucks to win.
The only players who have won more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and didn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't count the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, as well as that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could mark a potential European team victory on Le Golf National.
It would be best if they were playing at different lengths at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the early fourball hero when he and Alex Noren were saved.
Gods and doubles on the front of the Nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole from which they would never get out.
There's no one to help get out of the hole on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant advantage in the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a cut in the fight, in which some, especially in the States, have doubted.
Europe with a result of 10-6 includes driving on the final day of Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after winning the 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — took the lead, referring to two victories over fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current Le Golf National score to four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorna, trying to maintain the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, won a non-profit American team in the early form of fourball, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States has put on greater resistance in the form of foursomes, winning two matches, but could not defeat.
To maintain the trophy, Jim Furyka team has to get eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter who has won four points in a row, while together with Molinarim (this compound was called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which has won four points in four opening matches.
After the meltdown of Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball in a great style, they defeated the pumped Woods and American debutor Bryson Dechambeau, gaining an even more empathetic result of 5&4.
Woods, who got tired of two Saturdays matches, occasionally showed a brilliant genius, but so far he lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, and that's seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not taking part in the early fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to win the result of 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — taking positions 1 and 3 in the world rankings respectively.
However, the European team did not all come to mind in this pleasant, cold day on the field moved south-west from Paris.
The three-time main winner of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with the result of 2&1 over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and then returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with the result of 4&3 in foursome format, losing two holes opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup happened to make the team a four-point loss, starting singles, although the Furyka team would only have a remise to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, the Sunday contract seems rather unlikely.
North Korea speaks of a unilateral disarmment without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN talks that the lack of sanctions only deepens North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way for the country to unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of good will" last year, such as nuclear and missile testing, nuclear testing site dismantling and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see any concrete response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there will be no mention of the unilateral disarmament of North Korea".
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to "staged" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual action, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as it did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the summit between the President-in-Office of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim Jong Un undertook to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States representation announced that Pjonjang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls to mitigate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is obliged to "denuclearize in the first place" and to increase pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even against the signing of "war-end declaration," Ri said.
"The testimony that sanctions can put us on our knees is the hatred of people who behave towards us in a way that is ignorant.
However, the problem is that the lack of lifting the sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which he spoke about at the beginning of the week by the leader of the United States at the UN Forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months, and added: "If the party on denuclearisation was South Korea, not the United States, then there was no such impact on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when it said during the UN General Assembly that the goal of North Korea missiles in the U.S. territory is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" on the suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump Forum, which threatened to "complete destruction" of North Korea, he praised Kim Jong Una for his courage to take steps to disarm, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot more work, and said that until North Korea was removed from nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be removed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time limit for this, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjonjang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council forum: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and constant until we establish complete, final and verified denuclearisation".
Since 2006, the Security Council has issued a unanimous warning of sanctions against North Korea, attempting to boost the funding of the Pjonjang nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjonjang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea had condemned him for "setting gangster demands" within a few hours.
North Korea has committed this month to meeting with Moon Jae-in to dismantle the location of the missile testing and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He stated that Kim Jong Un told him that "appropriate measures", on which he was dependent, are security guarantees to ensure that Trump committed himself to Singapore, and that steps were taken to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in the course of adequate long rest
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all the students with more sleep to combat the growing macho culture, which is being taught by “caffeine-driven students”.
Students from the best university in the world often have no idea of the basics of care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of these types in the United States.
To create a course, he was inspired to speak about the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
"After the speech ended, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I saying this right now when I'm in my last year of study?"
She said no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, as well as improve students' overall self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said that this course was intended to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the academy where students click coffee cups, screens, exercises and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain regular sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this does not lead to an immediate change in the behaviour of students.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking cigarettes are with themselves," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride from "permanent science" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring sufficient amount of sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" for students combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even preventing weight loss, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger, which makes the student always hungry, said.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after taking part in one of his activities last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for the course for the entire campus.
The next step, he said, is asking all graduate students to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a reminder alarm when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as be aware of the harmful influence of "heavenly light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, which can disrupt the daily rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga provides Gerrard team
The Rangers suffered another time during the fight on their way to Livingston when Dolly Menga shot him to the defeat of the disassembled Steven Gerrard team, achieving a 1-0 result.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to score its first victory from the 4-1 victory in February over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won the second time in 18 matches, causing for his team a difference of eight points in terms of Leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' composition showing a lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers scored a fall in sixth place, Livingston scored a third — just for the Hibernian with one goal lost.
The Rangers may have other problems as a result of the need to address the wound to the head of Judge Caluma Spence's line after he was hit by the object thrown from the guest court.
Gerrard introduced eight changes to the team, allowing Air to be previewed and moved to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went through with the same eleven Livingston, who took the point of the Hearts team last week, being an exciting way in which his well-educated team tortured at every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored the goal in just two minutes, when this first Menga ball play allowed Scott Pittman to go with Allan McGregor's door, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed the deep drop off to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing in the defensive position could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quadrant, but it seemed as if they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly recognized that he had to drop the fine for fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on him, but Judge Steven Thomson had developed a Colombian claim.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two customs shots in the first half, but ex-Ibrox, Liam Kelly, almost worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and I weakly shot Ovie Ejaria.
While the liveston won in 34 minutes the goal of the opening match could be contrary to the running game, no one can deny that they earned it for their own effort to win it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with a deep, permanent fragment of the game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw a ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his peace, moving to Menga to just finish the action.
Gerrard did not empty the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately affected the wing, which threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting out of his position.
The Livingston team continued to attract guests to the game exactly the way they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long doses of each other.
Holt's team has been able to increase driving in the last few minutes, but McGregor has been good at Jacobs, after which Lithgow has removed the game from the dealer.
The Rangers Reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a death row when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger
And now the page of our Sunday Morning edition Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day he was born in Germany came the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, Geiger has become a part of both science and pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film, in which you had little chance of cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put in these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: "Now hear something!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cell.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise the enemies of the cell in the course of treatment.
This method is based on the isolation of the patient's immune cells and changes them to the laboratory.
Then they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, and then they are re-injected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who was treated with a vaccine, the resistance system to recognise the enemies of the cell was observed for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate the immune cells from the patient, change them into the laboratory, so that they can "see" the protein common to many of the cancers called HER2 and then inject the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer at Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very good.
HER2 "strengthens the growth of several types of cancers", including cancer of the breasts, ovaries, lungs and thick glands, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistant cells from patients and the "learning" of their location of cancer cells has worked in the treatment of certain types of protein.
Kanye West is on a pro-trump diet in the Saturday Night Live program – with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was "exploited" in the studio during the Saturday Night Live programme after he approved the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and said he would apply for the office in 2020.
After this night of his third piece entitled Ghost Town, in which he had set up a cover with the title "Make America Great", he turned against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
"As often as I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I were to worry about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the senate judicial commission on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the recording with West's output was sent to the social media by Chris Rock's comic book.
It's not known if Rock wanted to piss West off by mail.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had trouble with his hat behind the scenes.
"They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They took care of me!
And then they say I don't have an exit," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You're saying I don't have a way out?" adding: "I'm going to set up a "superman" pillar, so you can't tell me what to do.
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused the "blowing" of the public, and the members of the SNL team looked troubled — the Variety reports. A person in the study during these events: "The study had a grave silence".
West was invited to the program in place of Ariana Grande's singer, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by the many performances of the I Love it in the handling of the Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most important: Thank you for setting up your MAFII”.
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on her Twitter said that West was just "was himself and it's absolutely great".
"One thing I will NOT reward people (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "arts") who, I think, accepts and widely harms my society's ideology.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the rapper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "now formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then an artist known earlier as Prince.
A crime of attempted murder on stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
This happened in Ballyhackamore, as the police say.
The defendant is due to be brought before a court of law in Belfast on Monday.
The defendants will be examined by the prosecution.
The Star of the throne game Kit Harington raises the toxic question of manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO station series "The Throne Game".
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype hero macho, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In his interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from the throne game plan, the 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "surely", moving the issue.
“I personally feel pretty sure at this moment — where we made a mistake on the subject of manhood?” he said.
"What did we teach men as they grew up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of male toxicity may be partly responsible for television because of the presence of very male figures.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are they taught?
What does it teach on television and in the streets, making young people feel that they have to stand on a certain page to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change it?
Clearly, it's not all right with young men."
In the story he also admitted that he no longer played in any prequel or sequel throne games after the show ended the following year, saying that he “ended with battles and horses”.
From November Kit will play in the art of "True West" Sam Shepard, who is a story about the film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently stated that he considered knowing his wife Rose the best thing that happened to him in Gree about a throne.
"I met my wife on the plan, which gave me my future family and new life," he said.
In this award-winning Emmy series fantasy series Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the character played by Kita, Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14-percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, as health workers in that country do.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A determined majority of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV via sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from LGBT is widespread.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to insufficient safety during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies it as if one member of her team had disclosed the data of the senators of the Republican Party — “dangerous lies” and “theory of writings”.
The member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, dismissed the charges on Saturday as a member of her team to replace the personal data of three republican senators on the sides of Wikipedia and the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party has ensured that these accusations have been filed by experts and websites related to "super-judicial wings".
"False, lies and even more repugnant lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
Public information also included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it was replaced by an unknown person in the Chapter during a panel hearing in the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the question of the candidacy of Kavanaugh by three senators.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the post source was linked to the Waters office and published information about a Waters team member, as Hill says.
"This baseless task is completely false and it's a hundred percent lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were violated as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and it's a hundred percent lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman for the White House.
"This is the kind of denial that is bad," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, it can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
It shall not question the motives of the defendant.
He has to keep his peace for this."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The rough thing, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed “the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent charges”.
"The rapporteurs will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions that constitute a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — a Spanish parody with a weakened Red Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in every new British film has become the norm. It seems to apply in the case of a new part of the series of films of the type of action and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the screens in 2011 with the film "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-satisfaction of how hopeless we are become become the new export goods of the country?
In any case, eternally surprised, with a rubber face, the incompetent Johnny English again received a license to share — his name and name more than anything else signaling that he is a well-built, comical product for non-English views.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange charms to smoothie glamour, has a little from Inspector Clouseau, the Jasia Fasoli Sceptre, and a drop from this guy who adds one need to the melody of the lead Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson once played in forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there is one or two moments worth of attention.
I liked the scene in which Johnny English was approaching the helicopter, dressed in a medieval weapon, while his helmet was hit by a drumstick rhythmically.
On the screen you can see clearly the gift of Atkinson for the physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that at present also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Pips, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
Humorous elements seem to be directed rather to children rather than adults — I think Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as imaginative and consistent as the gags in these Atkinson films about Jasia Fasoli.
From the current assumption it is that Britain has serious problems.
Cyberhacker goes into the British superintendant network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the fear of an agent in service, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
It's the last drop in the burning spell of a prime minister who is a poppy, wasted character already and so suffering as a result of a nervous breakdown caused by lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, taking part in the role of Theresa May, but the script does not allow her to develop wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that, in order to reveal the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent — a few bad jokes when giving a mirror lesson by English.
English is called to Whitehall for departure, once again connecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the commander of the submarine — a happy but somewhat tired figure played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's party in the secret service of Her Royal Town return to action, meeting the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin, being played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic technological billionaire, who claims he can solve the computer problems of the United Kingdom — he is the catch of Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their cruise with absurd situations: the waiters dressed as waiters set the French restaurant on fire; they introduce chaos by sneaking onto the luxury yacht Volty; and English connects the launch while using the set to virtual reality to get to know the inside of Volty.
In this last sequence, all the restrictions are gone, but despite the nice and noisy performance, the whole film is very fond of children's television.
The typical average.
Like other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist the idea: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that would really correspond to his talent?
The working party rejects as if it were drawing up a plan that provides for a four-day work week for the British, for which they receive a five-day remuneration
The work party of Jeremy Corbina is considering the introduction of a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, receiving a five-day reward.
Similarly, the party wants the company's bosses to convey to the employees the savings generated by a revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, workers could enjoy a three-week weekend with the same amount of pay.
The sources suggest that this idea will "enter" into the party's economic programme and plans to leave the country against workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way of using employees to change the economy.
An older member of the Working Party in a discussion with The Sunday Times said: "A change of policy is expected before the end of this year".
"This will not happen from day to day, but the four-week work week is something that is part of the party's approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Working Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are currently not supported by all members of the Working Party.
The Working Party spokesman said: "The work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it".
John McDonnell, the chancellor of the Shadow Office, used the weekend conference of the Labour Party to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "directors without face" and "speculants" in public utility companies.
The plans of the Chancellor of the Shadow Office also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full share, because the Government of the Labour Party could make “declarations” on the basis of uncovered abuses.
It also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in corporate management and the establishment of integrated ownership funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector companies to those who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are responding to the "60 minutes" program on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their attitude
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and has raised a question as to whether the establishment of the investigation office might have led to the withdrawal of support from the Republican senators.
On Sunday's interview, Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that could change their settings.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after how did it happen when this engagement occurred, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined and unambiguous."
However, Graham's opinion seems to be cut out in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it takes a strong commitment to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett definitely denied it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of the people who are submitting could verify this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty to any extent?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that can be marked by an impressive composition of the stars and an equally impressive mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important objective of this event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international group of actors to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to this event (although it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, making telephone calls or other important actions to help raise awareness of the end of poverty eradication.
But what success can Global Citizen have in the perspective of the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case of so-called "klitivism" when people feel that they are doing something important by signing an online petition or by posting a Twitter entry?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, more than 19 million people have been "acting" in support of the action, seeking to achieve many different objectives.
It also argues that these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to declare commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group entered into 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, which already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the security measures have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and contractors engaged in "helping children achieve their full potential", which promised to hand over $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizen members sent over 4,700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, which is not experiencing, go to history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 British actions called for improving the quality of food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which reaches up to 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which sounded "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?"
The Global Citizen responded: “This will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will meet and deal with defeats.
But just as in the case of the most recent major civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that take place during this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a navy to "block" Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" flee to his military navy to prevent the flow of Russian energy to the markets, including those in the Middle East, the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner, said.
Zinke held that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States of America has the opportunity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to create barriers to ensure that their energy does not hit the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less about using and replacing fuels," he said, comparing Russia to a "knock that knows one trick" with a fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were made at a time when the Trump administration continued to carry out a mission aimed at increasing exports of short-lived natural gas to Europe, which is much cheaper for European consumers than for Russian gas.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" Nord Stream 2 project, which according to Trump made Berlin "slave" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas station, worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gap to 110 billion cubic metres, is a project of purely economic nature.
The Kreml argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project results only from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the Energy Secretary of the United States of America in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States led to a violent reaction by Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to step up EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country is ingesting our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting of Chancellor Angeli Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she's going to consider candidacy for the president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections she would consider candidacy for the president.
During her meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government. This is also the case for women in the highest position," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider my candidacy for the President's office."
At the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he is "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden expressed his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need FBI investigations before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the Massachusetts voters who chose the option "probably" said that the senator should not run as a result of a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known democratic names taken into account for the potential candidate in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press put it.
Sarah Palin talks about the stress stress team (PTSD) Track Palin during the election age Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years old) spent a year in Iraq after moving to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," said the public at the election age of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son a taboo arrest, after which she said about her son and other war veterans: “They return a little changed, return the prisoners, return, wonder whether respect will be shown for what their fellow soldiers, airlines and all other members of the army have given away to their country”.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla in Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, incitement to false testimony in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unwarranted state, as Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states and the Colombian District support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District support the legal challenge for the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a list of friends of smoking in Washington on Friday to support the applicant for asylum — according to NBC News.
The full name of the cause in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union organised in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her brutal sons from the gang" had abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salwador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has overturned the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which has allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Colombia, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignored for decades by state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle", as stated in the list of apricus curiei.
The prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants would harm the economy of the United States, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and become "the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the grounds of racial, religious, national or membership of a particular social group or of any other political belief," the session said in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum never intended to solve all the problems — even those serious — that people around the world are struggling with every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in the Pala, where the number of victims doubled in the race aimed at finding survivors
The situation was becoming more and more tragic for the survivors.
"It's a very intense feeling," said a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusuma, comforting her hot son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance will import the body.
There's no clean water."
The residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for the water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded, and hospitals, damaged by earthquake at 7.5 degrees, were quickly filled.
Some wounds, including two Haris, who had suffered spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the military hospital in Palus, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake on the ground, which shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I've been pushed into the Romanian wall." — Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help after which her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "punishing" advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial in an American newspaper that welcomes the benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere with the United States Congress, which will be held on November 6th — China denies the indictment.
Mr Trump's report that Beijing tried to interfere with the U.S. elections confirmed what US officials told Reuters that it was a new step in the escalation of the Washington campaign aimed at bringing pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating the trade war, which has led to an increase in tariffs for mutual imports.
The Chinese tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to be affected by exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump — Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, and former U.S. state governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had caused injury to American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register that China “now begins to be hit by double force by placing advertising advertising in our own free press”.
"By extending its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this there will be no voice of opposition in the street in Beijing and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic direction, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans express themselves before the mid-term elections of women with voting rights through an affair with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and armaments nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analysis warns that your members are meeting in the coming mid-term elections with a violent response, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans now officially wish to vote.
"This can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona's) efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI were enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget this morning and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national volunteer of the movingOn group -- as the newspaper published in Washington said on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesting scandalous password "Comes November", demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of the decision by the Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale," said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say that he was already tall — and that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women from pre-schools and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the Ford public notice, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republic decided to approve the candidacy, this could be met with a violent response.
"The Republican Party has to cope with a little confusion," Michael Steele said earlier last week, former president of the Republican National Committee, as NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the voting of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about the way in which the Republic has dealt with this situation and how Ford has been treated," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps in selecting Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a bit divided about who to believe in in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more support.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents firmly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent found that they firmly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of the respondents found that Kavanaugh was probably or probably lying during the testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI began an investigation into the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, who is Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reports.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominated Supreme Court showed her her genitalia at Yale University in the 1980s.
The manufacturer of the World Wide Web network plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web network, launches startup, which is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to specific information.
In an exclusive survey for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of Inrupt is "dominance over the world".
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet shop with personal data" or other POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal authorisation through data".
According to the president of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed in the project and the volunteer software community.
Starting this week, technology makers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, which from day to day causes a return to the top of all their business models.
"Don't ask for permission."
On Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a great deal to do in the debate on network neutrality.
The Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Marking the Spiritual Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which during World War I was marked as a combatant by the Victorian Cross, was taught 100 years later in his family town.
Colonel Bernard Vann was appointed on 29 September 1918 for the launch of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out he was marked by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a stone that commemorated the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone exactly in the seventh anniversary of the Grandfather's marking was "an exceptional symbolic character".
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under a strong shot from the field and machine guns”.
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "most courage" led her forward, and then, on his own, he launched an attack on the position of the agricultural sector, destroying three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to resist, but also something humble”.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he placed his sword after the parade conducted by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is shown in the support he receives from many people”.
MMA fans didn't burn all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Lead Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to watch out for the packed emotions of Bellator 206 gala and finally you can't see the main fight.
The program can be found in San Jose with 13 races, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the British sights were shocked by the change of the program to Lead Peppa.
Some were disappointed when they did not sleep until early morning hours, especially after seeing the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described an exchange for a cartoon for children as "some sick joke".
"In accordance with the Government's regulation, the content of this type is inadequate to allow it to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President of marketing and communication of Bellator when asked for transmission.
"Peppa's pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they're working on a timetable to take into account the views of Britain in the future.
"When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday sixth morning, so we won't be able to cope with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed there, we were caught up in a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical shock.
But it wasn't just a legal issue.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — to a standard quantity.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "bad" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jump, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program at Radio 4 run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular leader of this program for many years, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to the disease.
As he appeared in the program for the first time led by Laverne, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" from others because "the simultaneous love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferior value and being different is something that gives me the strength to be successful. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something valuable" so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time brown Olympic medalist has become a leading player in the LGBT community and has used his speech at this year's Community of Nations Games in Australia to appeal to a large number of countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy, able to live open, without any involvement, and thus wanted to give another “hope”.
The world's three-time champion said that a man's love — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "was surprised".
Daley married Oscar's winner (who is 20 years old) last year, noting that such a difference of age was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and father's death because of cancer three years later, "he said it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who had suffered similar injuries and falls.
The couple were the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
"Last year was the most important thing for me to get a gold medal," he said.
"And you know what? It's more important than the gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to take the lead.
"I couldn't tell him, "He won't be with us to be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died did I realize that he was not defeated," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — jumping into water before the crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best possible feeling,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — the Spring of Heather Small — that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and that continues to make him skinless.
Desert Island Discs program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11:15 BST.
Lack of Mickelson shape on the bench during the Saturday part of Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to work on his form so that he doesn't print his pen.
Mickelson, who played twice in every two years of the event, was sent to a cage by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as often happened in his case in the U.S. team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day at the top of the team and work on improving his game in order to correct the cause of his shipment to the bench.
The 48-year-old who has never given the simplest hits, even at the peak moment of his career, is not very well tested on the narrow Le Golf National field, on which the wrong hits are ruthlessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently discouraging for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, he must face the precision of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with the debuter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americas (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with the worm, the Mickelson game can become extremely key.
Furik expressed his confidence in his opponent — he could not do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, hit me on his back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's very sure of himself.
It is in the gallery of fame and has brought many into the game of its teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it turned out and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career at Ryder Cup, which never compared his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven resignations on his account.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny and it's good to have it in the team room," he explained.
“I think young players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's bringing his person a lot more than just a game."
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a high point advantage can soon be reduced
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a considerable point of view before starting a single in the last day Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a game in the field of Valderram, where along with his accompanying Vice-Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the finish line passed the shortest of possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"We can't forget that we had a great advantage in the field of Valderram; we also had a great advantage in the field of Brooklyn where we lost, and in the case of the field of Valderram we only won hair," said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave the 10-6 in the field of Le Golf National.
Time will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
You're giving it all up tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything you can.
The end will only be when the points appear on the table.
We have the goal of winning the trophy, and we need to focus on it.
From the beginning I said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who the opposite is — the best players in the world."
Bjorn, thrilled by the way his competitors dealt with the difficult terrain, added: “I would not do it better.
But tomorrow is something else.
Tomorrow they start single, and that's another question.
It's good to play with your partner when everything comes up, but when you play alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit of possibilities.
It's a message that we need to pass on to the players, so we'll get everything out of it tomorrow.
The partner must also give everything to him."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furik will expect his competitors to achieve better results alone than during the match with his partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Sam Furik experienced a great return to action the last day, being a member of the winning team in the field of Brooklyn, after which he suffered defeat after the European team did "a miracle in the field of Medina".
"I remember every word," he said in answer to the question, how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, was warmed up to fight his athletes on the last day.
“We play 12 major games tomorrow — you want to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brooklyn and Medina.
If this drive goes to one side, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle swords.
We set up our composition accordingly and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to admire tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to conduct the contract, leading Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the front half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to deal with all the games," Bjorn said about his single choices.
New German warship again late
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be used in 2014 to replace the older warships since the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to poor systems and increasing costs at an alarming rate — as local media have reported.
The surrender to use "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigate, was moved to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, referring to the words of the military spokesman.
The ship was expected to be included in the warship in 2014, but changes to this ambitious project had to be made as a result of the problems that arose after delivery.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class troops ordered by a military sailor in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will, of course, be equipped with a powerful function, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-shipments, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reduction of radar, red and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include longer periods of conservation — the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from the mother’s ports.
However, further delays mean that these modern warships, which are designed to enable Germany to react to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of the newspaper last year, when this German warship officially refused to give up the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time a warship had returned to the ship after delivery.
There was little information on the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key "software and equipment flaws" that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
In particular, there were software errors, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the older Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and restricts the ability of the Navy to carry out the war of future modernisation.
It is considered that the 7000 tonnes of ships "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the whole project — including crew training — is also a problem.
It is said that it reached a misleading level of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German fleet's force is smoking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that sailors "end up with ships capable of use".
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of withdrawal from the operation of the old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Netopris
New studies carried out on the site in the Scottish Highlands area are aimed at showing how they use the landscape in an unoccupied way when obtaining food.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these exceptional flying sugars and to help direct future action to protect them.
The research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will concern poly and small cartilage, as well as long-eared brown bats and red-neck bats in the Inverew Gardens in Western Ross.
Special registries will be located in key locations around the property to track the activity of the netope during the whole season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
The purpose of the expert sound analysis of all the recordings is to determine the frequency of signals sent by the non-stopper and the mode of behaviour of the individual species.
A map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their landscape-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of work related to the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest sites for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the Netoperra population has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which have an impact on buildings and the loss of buildings.
Wind turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, as well as beauties on flies and some chemicals used in construction materials, even home cats.
They're not really blind.
However, because of the nightly habits, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in catching the prey.
They use a complicated echolocation technique to search for robots and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organisation, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 observatory buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is still very serious.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, building control and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland on the site of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the property manager, says she's for the unstoppable ideal territory.
"Threave has a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent living quarters.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of controlling the occurrence of netopersis before entering into conservation work in possession, as accidental destruction of one building may kill 400 women and young people, which may result in the disappearance of the entire local population.
They are protected — their killing, harassing, or harming, as well as their destruction is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in the case of many species, we don’t even know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of violence while his lawyers intend to invite German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo identified charges of violence against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves", using his name.
His lawyers are going to invite a German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to a Friday report, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375 000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the charges were filed, defined these reports as "fake news" in an Instagram live report directed to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said a five-time gold ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for speaking my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm happy, and everything's fine," the baller with a smile on his mouth added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to call for Der Spiegel's magazine in connection with tasks that have been called "an inadmissible privacy suspect report," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer would claim compensation for “moral damage to the amount of the right of violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The entrance was scheduled to take place in June 2009 in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg similarly went to the football room, where he allegedly raped an analytic woman — as a result of documents filed in the Clark County District Court District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after a long time and told her that "99 percent is a good man", which was visited by this "one percent".
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it happened with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later she agreed to the extrajudicial agreement, because she was "feared for revenge" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now, because she still can't forget about the supposed coming.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret all the time" car manufacturers' departure
The Great Britain would "complain it all the time" if after leaving the European Union she lost the world leader in car production status, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "anxious" when UK representative Toyota told the BBC in an interview that if Britain left the EU without agreement, production in Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the European Union by the end of March without agreement, production will be stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, as car manufacturers say, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of leaving the European Union through the UK without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of "just-in-time", in which parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of cars produced on the order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without agreement, it may be difficult to cross-border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and disadvantages in part.
As the company representative said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without delivery to his factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said the Chequers Theresy May plan for future EU relations is "precisely designed to avoid border control".
"We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the present success but also to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4.
"Not only the Toyota declarations, but also other producers, demonstrate that we must be able to continue what has been a very efficient supply chain."
Toyota’s representation was unable to determine how long production will be suspended, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the United Nations Board of Trustees, said that members are increasingly concerned about the relationship: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The spokesman for the government said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union".
The meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again as White House is given
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed next week" due to the ongoing fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as he presented on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the possibility of involving Russia in the elections, the links between close members of Trump and Russia, and the potential for hampering the President's action of justice.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times newspaper, Rosenstein spoke about holding a hearing to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports as if he were going to resign.
The meeting date with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, and there was a shift to a meeting to avoid collaborating with the hearing of the senate judicial commission, during which the testimony was made by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump conducted a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
The Trumpa press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it can be held this week, and it can be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I'm sure I'll inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House.
The program manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by an aversion to the "hospital" television journalists, and she added: "I will not hide that they are "hospital".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President-in-Office is holding more "Questions and Answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving any evidence: "We met with numbers".
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists are able to directly ask the President of the United States questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and we have done it very often in the last few weeks. Press conferences will set the seats of such sessions, during which we can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Soluble press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why he is, acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Minister of Health writes to workers from the countries of the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health applied a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish Health Service to express their gratitude to them and to ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of considering applications for "setled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations on Britain’s departure from the European Union continued, and decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British Government has also intensified preparation for the possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery as a result of a head injury
The broadcaster of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, went through the operation as a result of a head injury in the Vanderbilt Commodores Saturday match, which ended the defeat of the Tennessee team with a result of 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the racer was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the sideline, and then he leaned on the ground," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie a side-by-side load, then placed it on the nose and carried it out to carry out further tests.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/size of injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (student of the second year released from school for a year to train his skills) plays its first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five greys, which gave him 18 greys throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher treasure charge when purchasing real estate in Britain
In line with the new tourism plans, the purchase of property in the United Kingdom will be subject to higher taxes. This means that the funds will be made available for homeless aid.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corby's actions aimed at attracting a young electorate.
The tax charge will include persons who do not deduct taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Treasure expects that in this way it will get even 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May informs today that foreigners buying real estate in the United Kingdom will be charged a higher treasure fee and that additional funds will be provided for homeless people.
This move is being taken as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate with the promises of cheaper apartments and increase the burden of more workers.
Higher taxes will apply to individuals and companies not paying taxes in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government to fight homelessness.
In addition to the current tax, the additional fee, including the higher rates for other houses and the rent-purchased apartments, which were introduced two years ago, may amount to up to three percent.
The treasure of the state expects that this move will make it worth up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built property in London is purchased by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult to buy the first house or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property, and most of the time they spend abroad, many rich regions — especially the capital — have become “a city of spirits. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in taxes, which would help young people buy the first house.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it. Prime Minister May also called for the abolition of the limits of modern housing in order to eliminate the "dwelling scandal" in Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the "no reason".
It also wants to empower local governments to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as a prime minister, I was involved in rebuilding the British dream that every next generation would live better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our beloved housing market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can equally easily buy property that is difficult for British residents.
For too many people, dreaming about their own home has become very remote, so the humiliation associated with the need to sleep on the street remains so real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become a Scottish electorate"
Sunderland Team Coach Jack Ross says his "most ambition" is to become a selectionist in Scotland at some point.
This four-year-old Scotland is working on the North-East Club's health, which is currently taking the third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that year after he introduced St Mirren club back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a racer,
But I was only able to get to staff B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched with my father the game of Scotland in Hampden and it always attracted me.
However, this possibility will only come if I succeed as a club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors were coach Sunderland, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel discouraged, taking the role of such famous personalities in such a big club, rejecting previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I will now be able to measure my success if I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In view of its structure and the conveniences it has, there is no doubt where it is located," he adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'm sure I've been successful here, only if I'm successful."
Rossa's coaching career lasts only three years. Previously he was a coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Allo to re-emerge after the downgrading to the third league, and in the next season he led the St Mirren team from the end of the fall to the championship title.
Jack Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real point of return," that's how coach Allo's position is covered.
“I really believed that driving a team is much better for me than playing.
It'll sound weird, because as a contestant, I've worked well and I've achieved a few measurable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to go through different situations every week.
They're still meeting me when it comes to the stress and the stress associated with the coach's work, but I feel good about this.
I've always wanted to train others and now I'm doing it.

Studies show that the best time for beer is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer flood caused a massive flow of customers to British pubs, but it took a wait in the restaurants' networks.
Research has shown that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, who developed the data, says: “The continuing decline and longer than expected participation of England in the World Championships have resulted in the results of July being similar to June when the turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings dropped even more.
The fall in sales in restaurants in July was further increased by 1.8% in June.
Drinkers of pubs and bars did their best — the increase in sales exceeded the drop recorded in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the burns, although not as much as the owners of the restaurant.
It looks like people were just wanted.
The sale of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman of RSM, who is an analyst in the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are reflected in the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the size of 'outside home' consumption remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant networks are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the drop in sales of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have a particular impact if the constant pressure to reduce costs is taken into account.
The long and flammable summer has come at the least beneficial moment for the owners of the dining room and the time will show whether some more moderate temperatures we had in August bring so much relief."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is responsible for monitoring sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds.
One for five children has secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has secret accounts on social networks that they hide from parents and teachers
The survey carried out among 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
These reports raised concerns that sexual content is published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that shows parents
One for five children — some of whom are only 11 years of age — has an account on social networks that they do not disclose to adults.
The survey carried out among 20 thousand elementary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to the Instagram service, in which photos can be shared.
These reports raised concerns that these accounts are intended to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students have admitted to having a "main" account, which shows their parents and also has a private account.
One of the mothers who, by chance, stumbled on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who told others to " rape her".
The study conducted in independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK and the Association Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles.
HMC's president Mike Buchanan says: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are creating their places on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Athletes Eilid Doyle, she was elected Executive Director.
Eilid Doyle is the most renowned Scottish lightball player. President Ian Beattie has defined this move as an excellent opportunity for sports managers to benefit from her rich international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a great respect for Scottish, British and world leagues and we are confident that its introduction into the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish league," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very happy that I will be able to convey the voice of athletes to the Council, and I hope that I will be able to really help in managing sports in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four gold medals in the Olympics, won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantis Olympics, and is now a regular member of the BBC as an expert, cannot be the result of a transient nonblood attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't go.
Doctors have said that time will show me whether or not I'm going to be successful and to what extent.
It was a cathartic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
Lactator advertising that compares mothers to cows stimulates extreme Internet emotions
The company producing lactators called for a storm on the Internet, publishing a commercial that compares breast - feeding mothers to doggy cows.
To announce the launch of the "first in the world of a silent lactator to wear under clothes", its producer, Elvie, published a fungal advertising in the form of a television, which highlights the freedom he provides to his mother.
She presents four true mothers dancing in a bright field of art in which to hear the words: "Yes, I understand, but I don't see a goon" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
And the referendum goes this way: "Throw them out, throw them out, feed them to children, throw them out, throw them out, I understand my masters."
The advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a baby, with their children being taken after a few days from birth," wrote one user.
Elvie's lactator can be worn under the bistonosis to feed (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can stop their children."
Someone else added, "This advertisement is completely out of reality."
Another weapon of the clip — one of the women said that she thought the song was “a fun one. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy myself one of those.
I just felt like a cow when I was taking off my food.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I'm not looking for her on the second floor.
It's a great invention." Someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun commercial directed to mothers who pull food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘blood’.
It is not intended to commend or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the movie, it turns out that women danced with lactators that were discreetly attached to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or pipes and it can be worn unobservable under the bistonosis to feed, which gives women the freedom to move, to hold children on their hands, and even to leave the house during the withdrawal of food.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Laktor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a courageous and provocative premiere.
As we put the feeding women and the dairy cows together, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, presenting at once in a fun and harmonious way the feeling of freedom that he provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie lactator hit the front of the paper.
During the London Fashion Week the mother of two children showed up on the show Martha Jakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to the camps on the border with Texas
The number of children detained immigrants is increasing sharply, although the number of people crossing the border does not change each month. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and the principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being exposed to deportation if they report after the child.
This risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the fingerprints will be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living in the common holding, who will then be transferred to the immigration office.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had reportedly been sponsoring children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been previously reported.
“At least 80 per cent of those who are sponsors or reside with them in one household are illegally resident in the country, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we keep chasing them," Albence said.
In the context of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, security officials have introduced new rules that require that part of them appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was done in accordance with previous standards.
Much will be done through videoconferencing, not personally, to ask the immigration judge to legalise their status.
Those who do not qualify for exemption will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are arrested, the easier it is for them to become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to attacks of aggression or an attempt to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious for larger centres, such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to see signs that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a camp without providing them with adequate time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already coping with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in that country has been going on for eight years.
Moual, who also plays the role of vice-premier, said that foreign forces are illegally residing on Syrian land, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
Moual claims that "the war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to "fight its holy battle until the territory of Syria is cleansed" both from terrorist groups and from "all foreigners residing illegally".
Currently, there are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria who are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian forces who oppose and advise President Baszar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moual found that the conditions are good enough for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "excusing unreasonable fear", which discourages them to return.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations for help in these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing things that should be of a purely human dimension".
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes the opposition to the political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN-led diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moual stressed that the agreement had a "clear time frame", and expressed the hope that military action would be measured in jihadists, including combatants from the Al-Qaeda Front of the People's Defense of Levant, who would be "removal".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon for the first meeting of a new commission composed of members of the governing party and the opposition to develop a draft of the Syrian military constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Commission, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "to verify the current constitution" and warned against ingestion.
Why Trump wins again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers may hope, his presidency would soon end with the removal of the office and the scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of the presidency so far".
There's no sign of seeing fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the results of the CNN channel in the primary team have been more than doubled and reached 1.05 million views and the MSNBC channel — almost tripled to 1.6 million views.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of the highest visibility, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and broadcast in the MSNBC channel The Rachel Maddow Show has achieved the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million viewers of evening information programs.
"People fly like we go to the fire -- that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the leading producer of the ABC series "Designated Survival" about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy artist and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He mentioned how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager said he'd vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he replied.
"Chaos has fun value."
Of course, reports from Washington could, like anything else shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of the integration of immigrant families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury where only the most privileged views can be allowed.
In addition, this is not just about being well-informed citizens, when you look at the panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward from secret informants while writing the book Fair, about Paul Manafort's jacket of stress for $15,000 (“overloaded pride” clothing, as defined by The Washington Post) or about the implications of the shocking details of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he does, in part, reminds the reality of the show in that every evening he delivers new content," said Brent Montgomery, Director General Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing siege and the daily returns of the Trump show (such as the attack on the NFL players or the praise of Kim Dzong Una).
You can't afford to miss the cut because you're gonna have some addiction.
When I met Mike Flies this week, the weather on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
This could not have been the case, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judicial Commission and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Cash flow from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is no wonder that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, which will now be the result of the race for one post of two congressmen, the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania will flow to the cash river.
This recently established suburban district of Pittsburgh represents at Congress a representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represented the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by a new 17th district.
Circuit maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, which gave the Republican preference and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new circle 17 began with the fight for the financing of the campaign between the party’s main funding authorities — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning hair in widely commented elections to the 18th electoral district, which took place in March.
For more than a decade, the Republican was in office, and Donald Trump won 20 points in this district.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea
The diplomats noticed that Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama, and until he was released by the partners of the group managing Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
The officials of the Department of State decided to revoke the heads of the US diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican and Panama because of "the recent decision to stop recognition of Taiwan", said Heather Naurut, a spokesperson for this month's Department.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on Salwador, which was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017, inter alia, aid to combat drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and visas for certain persons, would be very sensitive to this Central American country, which is struggling with a large unemployment and a high rate of murder.
In the light of the progress made by the international meetings of North and Central American officials, the conference was postponed at a high level, which was intended to address the safety and economic well-being of proposals from a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In mid-September, the top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus making every effort to consider sanctions against Salwador.
The diplomats say that at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence is due to appear, which is to be a sign of the invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
The three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominicans, and they did not accompany any new harsh communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesman for the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations, subject to the provision of anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analysis of the administrative environment, which also expressed itself anonymously.

Another element may be the Special Prosecutor's report, Robert Mueller, on the possibility of obstructing the measures of justice by President Trump, for which concrete evidence is currently available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller's investigation also examines whether Donald Trump's campaign had something to do with Russia's attack on American elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held responsible for preparing for re-election before the voters, and may even be tried before the jury.

Racer Rangers Club, Graham Dorrans, with optimism awaits a match with the Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that the victory with Austria, after the impressive resignation from Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until 2nd with Villareal the knee contusion made it impossible for assistant Graham Dorans to play this season, but he believes that the result will work on Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It did us good, because Villarreal is in good shape," said 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the faith that we were going to achieve something — and we got rid of the point.
Maybe we could still push them, but generally the resignation is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we were better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will get three points, but this match will be difficult because our opponent has achieved a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the kibs, we will go through and we will fight a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard because of everything about my conjunctival and the changes in the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our seats.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can keep going, leave the last season behind and make a success."
The fear of pension savings is driving women out of bed.
Although those involved in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, there was little talk about it with the family.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants found that they were talking to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with the kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take care of this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide insurance company.
What do you want to start with?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not express your will in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family where and how you want to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask the financial advisor for help: He can help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows cash to be paid for such expenses, or from your own property, if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these court battles.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake on the land and tsunamis that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims is likely to increase.
No information was obtained from the Dondgal Kabupatene, which is located north of Pala, near the earthquake epicenter of the earth at 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated from Paul.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the settlement of Dongala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebius, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017 there were 379 800 people.
When the earthquake struck the land and the tsunamis, it was the 40th anniversary of its establishment that the trade took place in the city.
It is a kabupatene (administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in 2017.
The main branches of the Central Celebius economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially on the coast of Dongala.
Another source of province income is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, over the past 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Pala and Dondala several times.
In 1938, the tsunamis that struck Dondall killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunamis in West Dongali.
Indonesia is on the active seismic Pacific ring of fire, causing earthquakes to occur quite regularly there.
Maximum earthquakes of land and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which hit the western coast of the province of Aceh on 26 December, caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the western coast of Sumatra visited a series of severe earthquakes.
On the island of Nias on the coast of Sumarty, hundreds of people died.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, there was an earthquake of 6,8 degrees, triggering tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near the town of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the islands of Mentawai near the coast of Sumarty. It caused a wave of tsunamis of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The flat earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's cabin in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction that brought fatal consequences of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no wave of tsunamis, but over 100 people were killed by the crashing buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and caused temporary difficulties for thousands of tourists.
Oldest son of Sary Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaska and candidate for Vice President,Sary Palin, was arrested under charge of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Wasilla in Alaska, the 29-year-olds were arrested with domestic violence, difficulty in filing a report and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he picked up her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in custody of the Mat-Su investigation and has a fixed bail amounting to $500.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court where in his defence speech he stated that he was "surely innocent".
There are three Class A violations on the fuel, which means he can be punished even in the year of the prison and $250,000.
He was also accused of violating Class B, which threatens to punish the prison day and the fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is now before the Alaskan Veterans Appeals Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of making it difficult to file a report and of having weapons in a state of negligence in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who associated aggressive behavior with the stress team he had acquired during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of tsunamis after earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of the fifth earthquake that visited the Indonesian island of Celebes.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not functioning and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
Earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In the social media, movies show a moment of disaster.
When the tsunamis hit the coast, hundreds of people were found at the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York demand the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which has resulted in the death of eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov said he used a rented truck Home Depot, which he drove on foot and bikers on his way.
According to the announcement made in the Southern New York District of the intention to claim the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "totally" killed eight victims and "totally" caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court record, the death penalty is a threat to both of these charges.
Several weeks after the Federal Court of Appeal attacked Saipov, an indictment involving 22 positions, including eight allegations of illegal activity — which is a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime — and the commission of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organisation of the attack required "solid planning and thinking".The way Saipov carried it out was defined as "atrocious, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, harm and loss to his family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina, who lived in New York touristally.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the South New York District ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally heard a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty resulting from the federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenbergach. Marriage was lost after two years earlier they were considered guilty of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov's court documents, which came from Uzbekistan, he did not show any conscientious objection within a month of the attack.
The police say the investigator said he was feeling good about what he did.
According to Saipov's indictment, he admitted to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, he also demanded the suspension of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
In the case of an indictment involving 22 defendants, he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders from Saipova's office, said they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to request the death penalty and refuse to live without the possibility of an early release after admission to guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought upon all the interested parties," he said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors to stay out of the death penalty.
Parliamentarian on tour says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the tour conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians must "feel hot" beating Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's parliamentarians suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
The Conservative MP, Peter Bone, told the protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit's secretary, "the United Kingdom would be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the rides to the personal protest against Brexit, which was held in the city, further stressed the burden of their deep-separated series of tasks ahead of Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is working hard to implement his Chequers compromise plan between Brexit's supporters, his opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite the opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labourers to make a choice between its proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "put out a plan from the Chequers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should become the Plenipotentiary, who should be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to do so, we would be outside the Union now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from the Chequers".
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars since then to be subject to anyone.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens change their opinion since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the Union is completely false.”
Brexit Andrea Jenkins from the Tours, who told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, please listen.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy support in general, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists who are crowding out the streets and who have chosen us do not support it.
Please discard the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: "The premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage stated that politicians taking part in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us — people — and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do it'".
Turning to the reasoned crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians on the edge of Brexit feel warm.
"We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has given us victory in the referendum on Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At the time, Brexit's opponents were marching through the city to the center where a two-hour demonstration took place.
The activist's ring was waving the "Torys against Brexit" banners after the group was set up this weekend.
Laborist activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, changed the conservatives for the security issues of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who say they can organize IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus Plan, a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to "consider seriously" the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "he will seriously consider candidacy for the president".
As The Boston Globe reports, the Democratic representative of Massachusetts spoke about her future when she met with the voters that took place on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, will apply for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who was the co-president of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 elections.
It is now said that Warren can win the Trump in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump embraced the government.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington to repair our failed government — and it also means a woman on the top.”
Arresting a fatal gunman in which a player of the LSU team, Wayde Sims died
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana reported on Saturday about the arrest of a suspect on a Friday shooting in which a basketball player from the LSU team, Wayde Sims, died.
The Baton Rouge Police Department informed of the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson at the conference, which took place at 11:00 east time.
On Friday, a shot was published with a request for help in identifying the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with firearms in his head, resulting in his death," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being in a crime scene, with a gun on his side and shot at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to a police station in East Baton Rouge County.
The measuring 1.98 m. Junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches, with the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the park, earned 5.6 points and counted 2.9 collections per game.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command enabled him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since the time that Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the command of the Mercedes team will have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service station as the first one and allowed Hamilton to drive in a pelleton's tail, which should decide on the races.
The Mercedes racer went to the box in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after the action around the circle, which led the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the internal part of the track, risking a push to the defensive after a double race to defend the position on the third turn, Hamilton moved on.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in the seventh place.
He then ran through a large part of the race because he did not change the tire to perform a fast finish and take Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth position.
He finally went to the service station at the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds, he was no longer able to speed up.
“It was a hard day because all weekend Valteri was doing a great job and becoming a real gentleman when he was asked to let me go.
The whole team gave everything to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad talk body.
During the meeting that took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump approached Senator Diana Feinstein, who held that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused her of assaulting Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Senate of Justice Commission. Instead, he said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are “disgusting, malicious and lying”.
"What could have happened is one, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger when we see people who are angry, angry, angry and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, did we not reveal" – he added, undermining the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents ran out in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein testified to the commission as reported by The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion and, in accordance with her request, I did not disclose these contents."
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented: “I tell you, it was really a bad talk of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing to defend candidates to the Supreme Court, whose three women were charged with sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take over any measure.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take over the authority and control," said the president, according to the media service report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In the game with the club Dundee Patrick Dwyer won two goals for the Giants team
The Dundee Stars Club has rested on its Friday victory in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants team, winning a rejuvenating match on Saturday at 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a double advantage after the shootings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne matched the result, after which Dwyer took the Giants again to lead.
Francois Bouchard rebalanced the result, winning the goal for the Dundee team, after which two doors shot by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third game in the Elite League season for the underprivileged Adam Keefe, who won the Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
Both teams met in this season for the fourth time — the first three matches won by the Giants.
The opening target of Dwyer fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assistant Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later Beauvilier doubled the result thanks to assistant David Rutherford.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a.m. Sullivan introduced a team of businessmen back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt matched the result at 15:16.
The Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break when at the end of the first third he gained his second goal that night.
The type of owner was regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the result of the goal won during the game in the drive at 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second quarter, Cowni and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen to provide the Dundee team with the first advantage in this game. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in the last half of the third quarter by the same racer who shot the fifth goal for his team.
The giants who lost their last five matches four will play the next match at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies helping hundreds of people on the plane escape the earthquake
The control of air traffic from Indonesia was shouted out by a hero after he died, helping to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were considered missing after the great earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the region. In the city of Paul many people have been imprisoned in the rubble.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the scattered air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air (lot number 6321) flight, which was on the runway, was safely started.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they'd hit.
He died in the hospital.
According to an Australian station ABC News spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that the controller's decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Antonius left this morning before the swindler arrived at Paul.
"This message has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities can reach thousands. The National Disaster Relief Agency informs that access to the cities of Dondala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death is still growing, because many bodies are still under threat and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
The six - foot - long [6 m] wave of tsunamis destroyed Paul, where the mass burial of the victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News station: “Ambulans are constantly importing bodies.
There's no drinking water.
Small shops are being looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing for rescue, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
It's a tragedy, and it could be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Yoko Widodo, came to Paul’s office: “All of you, please, work day and night to carry out all the evacuating tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
This year, Indonesia has already seen an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines say one person is missing after the plane crashed on the lagoon
The airlines operating the flight, which broke down on the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person was missing. They previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the flying plane.
Air Niugini reported that one man who travelled a feral plane could not be counted on Saturday afternoon.
They made sure that they and local authorities, hospitals and investigators were trying to find him.
However, they did not respond immediately to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water during the landing on the island of Chuuk, the local ships helped save the other passengers and crew members.
The officials informed Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It's not clear what caused the disaster.
Airline and U.S. Navy say the plane landed on the lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the belt.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was coming very low.
"This has helped us very much," he said.
Jaynes said he was able to get other people through the passageway to get out of an emergency flying plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy military informs that the rescue action also helped the sailors who were working on the modernization of the coast. With the help of a drowned boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea. However, there are no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed events from the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office concluded the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for many hours as a fugitive in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how using cell phone records he replayed the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he obtained data on the location of various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the ferry evening.
When the data confirmed that when Quinton was supposed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified he wasn't in town that day.
To the prosecutors' question whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck last night, he replied that he was "lie because my truck was then in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is Tellis's claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records have shown that they've known each other only a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact data from the phone, as well as text messages and connections.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case was likely to be handed over to the jury on the same day.

Another black one?
Nania from New York calls for a couple to be released after "racist" SMS
Nania from New York calls for a couple to be released from work on a racist basis after receiving a misaddressed text, in which the mother of the child complains that she is "another black person".
The couple denies as if they were racists, comparing the call to "santage".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, was clearly impressed when it turned out that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, who had been on her first day at work in 2016, was a blacksmith.
“NO, THE CHALLENGE MAN, ” she wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Faxman realized that the guff had been filled, Giselle Maurice was "shrewd" by Giselle Maurice, claiming that the heart-to-heart ninja, who is an African American, was poorly carrying out her duties, and she was also expecting ninjas from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day, and then she was sent to Uber's house.
It is now requested to pay compensation for the release of 350 dollars a day multiplied by six months for which it was initially employed with the residence, although it did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," the Post newspaper said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple is opening up the charges of racism, claiming that the conclusion of cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified, because after she was painted, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to the Postman.
“Would you trust your children in the person you have hurt, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, let's go."
Comparing the call to “sanction”, Plasco said that his wife had been born only two months earlier and was in “very difficult situation”.
"Are you going to blow something like that?
It's not too nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public opinion quickly issued a few judgments in the social media, criticising it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the books about Paddington were afraid that readers did not feel connected to the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm adoption of the book, says of the letter: “It is hard to put herself in the place of the person who read it for the first time before publishing the book.
It's very funny now that we already know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She claims that her father, who had inspired him to write a book for children before the little mouse, worked as a cameraman in the BBC, was sure his work would be rejected. He adds that after his death last year 60, the book's edition seems to be "sweet-gorzka".
About Paddington, described as "a very important member of our family", says her father was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't hesitate," he adds.
“One thing because Paddington seemed very real to him was that you almost had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, though it wasn’t your merit.
I think Paddington's success has seen less of that way.
Although he himself invented it and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life empty.
"Nad called regularly and said it's really bad that it's probably not going to come out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha will die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medicinal products given to her by doctors to maintain cardiac action were slowly discontinued and removed from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit down and wait for it to develop.
I couldn't go out, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because I was among other people.
I really needed to stick to it."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, went on board with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she was suffering.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Posts from women in mourning help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to seduce others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on Welsh Bridge emails with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help under.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed, and at the age of 18, he took his life.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Forty-five-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a good-looking cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could explain every room."
Before his death, however, he gave up his job because he was "in a really black place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and that's what he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the effect of domination."
Sharon Davis created the cards, “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if that’s all we know.
Don't be quiet. Talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
"He didn't say anything that he felt lonely, sad or something," he says.
“A few days before God’s birth, we saw a change in his behavior.
He was already in the middle of the world, when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “This is what causes a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on Italy because the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could really get what he asked for -- a time-limited investigation and a limited amount -- perhaps we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "break up" into opposing camps leading to impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican volunteers want to investigate the FBI?
All their ill will comes from time to time.
The election to Congress is already in a few weeks — November 6th — if the Republic loses its chances of selecting a particular person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already raised a phone to call the senators and have them back to Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will gain at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the governments of Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea is low
According to South Korean legislator Kim Dzong Un, seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South fell.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the United States, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 refugees were reported last year, and in 2011 - 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pjonjang did not issue a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally proposed South Korea citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than a strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to the country.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is theoretically still in war, has clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongang, where talks were held on the negotiations on denuclearisation, which had previously become a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement to try to clear the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on this issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we could split ourselves as the first," said Ri, in his speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh a " hysterical" and claims that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh a "history" and said that he is not naturally fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos delivered these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be regarded as a 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh presented to the Senate Commission on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his speech when discussing family matters and the years of his life.
He also clearly persecuted the Commission's Democrats, setting out the charges of "grotesque and coordinated attack on reputation" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelos found that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his prejudices about the Democrats.
"I think he's discredited himself by issuing these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would try to revoke Kavanaugh from the office if he received his nomination and if the Democrats had obtained the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi noticed.
"I say so: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also rule in this court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelos added that as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is afraid of possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would disregard certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical person who will expect us to say 'but it is wonderful'," added Pelosi.
And women have to control it.
It's the right diet, the months and years of pouring anger, and she can't throw it away without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
"It's quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company helped me tremendously. She said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she was nervous and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
He's still doing his own thing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are permissible as a way of getting angry for some reason because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first positions in a man - dominated office is that one time I started crying out of unspoken anger.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy that you've grown up."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated at the border of Patricia, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of self-nomination for the president.
"It wasn't a thoughtless decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"The elections were already made by seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has defined this situation as 'Queen Snow and Seven Beauty'."
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been addicted to collecting funds and has promised not to join the race if he doesn't collect $2 million.
It was a battle convicted of losing.
She discovered then that some of her favorites, who gave the man $1,000, had only 250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During a talk in which she announced that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and contact voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that her voice stuck to her throat.
"You can think I've gone through a nervous breakdown," she recalls the press reaction.
“You might think that Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my grave.
'Did she cry?'
What benefits can economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The salons beginning the economic war between the US and China were deafening and, although the battle is still ongoing, in the longer term the conflict between those countries can be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was launched this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, imposing duties on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week following the introduction of new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) which resulted in the taxing of half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Every time, Beijing withdrew in nature, raising the last charge on U.S. goods worth $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China is determined to respond to every hit in the USA and does not seem to have a second economy in the world soon to resign.
Pushing Washington to withdraw means accepting the demands, but the public humiliation of the United States would be too overwhelming for President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing played its cards well, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China by reducing its dependence on both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in some countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than the observers have so far acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, an Asian tank researcher at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, "ready" to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready to return refugees on a voluntary basis, and is asking for help in rebuilding a devastated country as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moual, stated that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our area is now more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normality, the government is building up areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements measured in their daily lives and maintenance measures can voluntarily return to it.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid under the conditions or from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe marks the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team with a result of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In the United States of America, they have already lost their sixth row and since 1993 they have not won the Ryder Cup Cup in Europe.
Europe won the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it won 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not go well through most of the tournaments, hit a ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th end of PAR3, giving the same match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of the four players that since 1979, when this first time this tournament took place in the current format, succeeded in achieving the result 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by a result of 5&4 by the lowest ranking player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world rankings, lost two miles ahead of the last long one with England's Ian Poulter, for which it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
Hispan Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight of these tournaments and has won 25.5 points of career as a European with the greatest number of wins in Ryder Cup.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is the success of the whole team and I am glad that I was able to help," said the alarmed Garcia after the victory of the team from Europe.
He's handing over his thumb to his parents, John Rahmo, who won a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, a result of 2&1.
“I feel the incredible pride of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
It's an unmatched statistics, as on one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and only succeeded Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had a lot of problems with finding commons all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played on a really high level throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing appearance of American composition, his captain, Jim Furik, said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed a few Europeans.
We're out of here.
Head pockets before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players were really good.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I can be their captain.
I'm full of surprises for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
Information about flowering in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote
The Commission's latest Florida Fish and Wildlife Agency report shows the overall decrease in plankton saturation in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of pstrocate blossom was recorded in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that it decreases.
It extends for about 209 kilometres of the coastline, from the north of the Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The excellents can be found about 16 kilometers from the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in a smaller number of places.
Zakwit was also observed in the county of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration of plankton in the coastal and coastal areas of Pinellas County, low to medium coastal area of Hillsborough, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high coastal and Sarasota County, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high coastal and Lee County and low in Collier County, was recorded.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier there are still cases of respiratory tract irritation.
Last week, however, they were not recorded in North-West Florida.
