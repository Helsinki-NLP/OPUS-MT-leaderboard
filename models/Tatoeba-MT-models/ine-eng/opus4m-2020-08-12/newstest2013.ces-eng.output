Republika Srpska's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy on the need to fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan’s Centre, however, marks such a fraud as a myth that the election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after a lightning strike.
In the last ten years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments have been declaring new laws since 2009 that make the election process or entry to the election list more difficult.
This event marked the beginning of the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, only 180 proposals were submitted for the 2011 election law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a photo identification certificate and a document on American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the election day and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the elections in 2006, no American state was required to submit a photo ID.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The founding of the Indian law was confirmed in 2008 by the US Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend this procedure to other countries.
In the last two years, proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 countries in order to force voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal certificate of identity, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens do not own, i.e. 21 million people of the age who can vote, no identity card with the photo issued by their state government.
Furthermore, there is no such certificate of identity for some five million new volunteers in 2012.
In addition, the required identity card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions concern mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 years and 20% of volunteers aged 18 to 29 years therefore do not have the required identity with the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, know their affection for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity certificate with a photograph issued by their school.
On the other hand, the same Member States allow members of fishing or fishing clubs who prefer to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, he did not require any state in the election of a citizenship document.
The first such request led to Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have adopted laws that provide for the obligation of volunteers to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit the number of votes against the Spanish minority.
It should be noted, however, that two out of three Hispanics give priority to the democratic side.
The Republican legislators in 2011 supported in eight states a bill that disrupts the voter's record on the day of the elections.
In addition, they have restricted the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigners helped register voters to register about 10 million people.
The measures adopted after 2009 but led to a decrease in the registration of new volumes in 2010 by 17% against 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for the upcoming elections in the five other states.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of African-American voters were elected in the first place, although only 13% of African-American voters in that country.
The Hispanics had the same thing.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting ahead.
On the other hand, the whites, who represented 76% of all volleyballs, made up only 46% of the volleyballs who chose in advance.
Against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters, democratic legislators and their supporters have, of course, been very important.
Democratic governors have blocked several bill proposals by their veto.
In order to stop the validity of the most controversial laws, even the Attorney General of the United States was struck.
Some of their damage has been limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 countries have adopted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card.
However, the newly introduced rules make the exercise of the voting right more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics are talking in particular about the presumption of approved laws and consider them to be a clear attempt to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the voter's assembly needed for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to announce that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Discovery of prostate cancer: to complete the examination or not?
The PSA test led to faulty results, which were wrongly negative or even wrongly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
This has all added to the weight of men who have already so competed for the investigation to go at all.
Let's have a look or not?
We asked for an opinion from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high level of contamination between individual groups tested is therefore difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality among patients who had been investigated and those who had not attended.
This study also demonstrated after a 12-year derogation that those who do not go to the examination have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend a 50-year-old examination or 40-year-old if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
They are also men of African American origin.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are inexhaustible.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the safety of its type of cancer, offer possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not have an impact on life in the long term, and focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men diagnosed with cancer do not treat them because their type of cancer is not aggressive or life threatening.
Instead, we will propose active surveillance and, in the event of disease progress, we will offer them treatment.
More and more often and more precisely, we define the criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which do not.
However, I recommend that the examination be completed.
However, it is important to consult your doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, a Movember tool has been created to assess for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the best way to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone had stopped smoking, this data would have risen to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for Canadian cancer research.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer disease causes heredity.
Some percent also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers is decreasing.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
It's an enormous loss to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million chickens in Quebec today," the head of the speaker, André Beaulieu.
Exciting data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death to cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fleshness and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat stomach and limb cancer, kidney, mucous membranes and joints.
"Registration shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the fat stomach," the report adds.
Survivor
That organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to ensure that the same rules apply.
Preservation of meat by fermentation, drying or salt may lead to the production of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report reports.
Vitamins
In recent times, various scientists have focused on the connection between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet come to a clear conclusion.
Studies aimed at vitamin E are inseparable according to the SCC.
Although one of them says that prostate cancer risks are reduced, another study says that it is increased.
Nor has the effect of vitamin D on cancer been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Dropping the investigation doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs's Bouncy Examined
The announcement of Higgs' likely discovery caused a legitimate riot in the summer.
There is an opinion that this bog is part of a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then it's the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "minor" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - which has not been empirically observed so far.
However, physics has not so far ruled by the fact that it is Higgs' boons.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very much like the Higgs Boon, as predicted by the standard model.
The new date published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto is more than confirmed, but all data is still missing in order for us to have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it's Higgs's boons, because the risk of error appears to be small, and let's see what this is about.
In this world, there is a totally unquestionable law that says that two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will get hurt.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it shows that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusivity principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantity state" - this "state" almost literally creates some of their properties.
They also divide the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or farmers, who properly observe Paul’s principle.
And on the other hand, the boons move, according to anarchists who don't care about anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be at the same place at the same time.
These boons are further divided into two groups according to the device (including absolutely amazing), which is The Parchment Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: the Messions, which we leave without notice here, and the "force particles", with which great natural forces are spread and with which Higgs boons are probably connected in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bogs are not as exotic as they could be thought to be.
If you read this article, it's because of the box with unusual Banality: photon, or "parts of light", which is the "bearer" of electromagnetic forces.
When particles with an electrical charge accelerate or change their direction, they "distribute" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a treasure thrown into a fisherman.
This "disruption" will result in electromagnetic waves (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but photons - and thus one of the boons, "power carriers".
More stable fields
So it's with the Higgs Bounce, just because it's just that it takes a different field, the Higgs field to show up.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its excitement it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as in the frozen level of the fisherman, which will only disappear a very large balloon.
For this reason, it is necessary to use both a huge part accelerator and an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with touching connections is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field are again appropriate to explain the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
Therefore, not all particles or all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not -- a piece of paper, for example, will never keep on the ice.
And it also pays that the Higgs field does not respond to all the particles: those who do so have a certain mass, while others (such as photos, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak's asking, what are all these researches that bring us?
From a scientific point of view, it is the confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to process any inconsistencies between observation and predictions of the SM.
In addition, a few physicists literally want to find them, because the smaller difference could open the space of "new physics" and heal some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has so far enormous deficiencies, does not provide any explanation of gravity (ooh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe mass (ooh!).
However, the CERN has not so far shown any such opposition.
Replies
The answers to these researches in your daily life and Mrs Novak's life can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be no.
Look: At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser advancers in Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work was causing.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physics of Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where a laser was found in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser paddle (previous papres were pulsed) in 1962, I've already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the laboratory".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may also come out of all the tools that surround research.
For example, Aunt Willard Boyle created a small light camera in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This camera, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course it doesn't mean that the activities around LHC have to change our lives, but it means that man never really knows...
Palliative care - the best way to get out of life...
By means of its Commission on the Right to Death, Quebec has recently been involved in a puzzling issue concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue early and at the same time the draft law is coming.
There is still much work to be done in this key area.
Le Devor magazine tried to look at this issue in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégia.
The prostate cancer that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," she says without emotion on her bed in Victor-Gadbois' palliative care house in Beloeil, where she arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he says.
The disease has done its job: Unrelenting weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
She looks at the delicious breakfast and agrees that we can help her eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop with him, bring him drugs, offer him a bath.
He dares to die a common death.
"My greatest desire is to get rid of that passage, he humiliates me," he confesses.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"A man's life is taught that men are wet," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person," says a psychologist.
According to a number of people involved in palliative care, the main moments are played in the very core of such return.
Patients who come home with Victor-Gadbois' palliative care are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is up to three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide so-called "treatment" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it is the worst fear of dying "inhaled with full consciousness".
But the disease has enabled me to discover my children.
"I have many children," he adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in my life," she says, and then she lets us plant her breathing device.
Yet he still looks forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the Victor-Gadbois house, a group of volunteers provide body care with food.
It looks like a palliative care that comes in unless you can't do anything else anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec there is one bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very small if we realize that we're all going to die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, he can be given brandy or peps, according to taste.
Diabetics don't have to watch their sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night they took Mr. X.'s beer, which he died later that night.
This morning, he'll have his son's beer for his father's funeral.
"We help patients as close as they are," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
Victor-Gadbois's house goes after each other for days, but they don't like each other.
Next to a 30-year-old man who is excited about his last meeting with his family carefully exposed to his pillows, while being attached to his honor, a tragically sixty-year-old man dies surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children after he has tried every opportunity to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer up to 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who come to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care intended to alleviate suffering as soon as the patient reaches the final phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Treatment Society, specialize more less exclusively in the care provided to oncological patients.
And this basic inaccessibility of health care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specialising in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, there has been a manifest sign of palliative treatment peaks, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they report their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure access to quality palliative care for all people before it is possible to agree with euthanasia.
According to the report, she recently experienced a patient who had spent 14 days in extreme pain emergency without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hopes of Hélène Richard's survival were already quite minimal when she left for advanced chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending treatment, she said she's sorry I stopped fighting, she'll tell us.
And then she told me it was over!
No All-Power Care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who want to die are grateful to their healing doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative fever has soothed their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the Director of Palliative Care in the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are being treated for pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of your life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which the patient will succeed until the end of the day, whether aggressively or permanently given sedatives.
It cannot be said that we do not accept this part of the suffering.
A patient we do not relieve of pain will have an ever-increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
Sedatives who are not given sedatives always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to relieve me of my pain."
The implementation of this report provided a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Great real-world scandals in Quebec
Travel management officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, lobbyists of political parties and experts in the Italian mafia continue to tell what they know about the wonderful "system" in which construction, state officials, politicians, experts and Mafia are involved.
This "field" came from Quebec taxpayers very expensive, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has spread since we adopted the basic measures," ironically, Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal, said.
This led to the collapse of the 2011 scandal on the basis of a consistent investigation into the financing of road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved until after a long delay.
The Spirit News confirmed the direct link between industry, transparent financing of the parties and corruption of state officials.
"From the beginning of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport saved on the bills of billions of dollars," when some people kept their instincts to get a share on them!
The Charbonneau Commission "which has led to the demise of two elders," adds with the hope that it will succeed in "discovering the integrity of some people".
Permanent Unit for Combating Corruption, founded in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit founded in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, "Marteau's family" politicians, who since 2009 have ensured that the "currency cartel" significantly mitigates the counterfeiting of orders...
In recent weeks, a number of visits have been conducted and they have accused of fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian businessmen, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito called for a sensation by explaining the "system" mechanism of obtaining public procurement.
He himself spent 3% of the value of the contracts he had received in Montreal during these years, via a mafia who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, for which Mayor Gerald Tremblay was a candidate.
Zambito has been generous to all parties since 2000 and has spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) on provincial parties, especially liberals who were then in power.
He also acknowledged that he had organised illegal financing for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Orders with cashiers whose prices have been exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very Chilean.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it very carefully before the commission: during ten years he received a gift from construction companies, an invitation to travel, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey games and pockets worth a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for orders with the money manager in which he overrun the price.
Other public transport operators have acknowledged that they have been allowed to pay their salaries for over 30 % to 40 % of their invoices by means of false duplication.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of turning his eyes on the current budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, putting Montreal into a widespread crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, it has been resorting to the sale of real estate purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters directly in the midst of the flourishing real estate trade.
70% of the dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that it "draws into chains in an effort to understand the functioning of the system of promoted ants to stop gangrene and trap the culprits".
The process is "sick, but positive" according to her.
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but it is necessary to establish a separate investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices can not be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have cut hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly afraid of the role of "informed ambassadors" if they don't get caught up in these rats!
She estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony she adds: "I have heard that this is just a weak reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but according to it, it does not resolve the situation: "Until strictly limited electoral expenditure, dirty money from politics does not disappear."
He proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer fail; if we are to take a bold look at the substance of the matter, we can rebuild on a stronger basis and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has obscured the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that everyone laugh at him to look at their own castle...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG were at a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone to their place, or by a completely new dimension of the PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier to play games.
Everything's going very fast in football.
I'm not losing my mind.
From the beginnings of my preparation in INF Clairefontaine until after my transition to Saint-Etienne, I've always had a certain degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti...
The positions of this year are common to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me has a greater sense of winning and wants to give maximum power.
And also, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelle who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today, he is not equal to himself in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's got a lot of experience and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a calming conversation with him.
I had a number of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st Lise, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in the pen.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: we have made it very easy.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a heavy opponent for the quality European teams.
We first want to win our qualification group in front of Port so that we can play in the osmiffial response at home.
Can the PSG be in the short term with a large European club?
The budget's already got...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and join history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, the PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st league as in the last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league.
We've been missing enough in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We've collected 79 points.
It usually turns out that with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had even more amazing season.
I think it's going to happen this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to get a title, I think we have weapons available to beat them.
You think PSG media is expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us because of what's invested here and what players we have.
We accept it completely.
It's true that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something in the papers that we're counting on, it's not exactly nice.
You're asking what else people can want from you.
Of course, we can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
We've been able to play at the Masters' League.
Look at Manchester City, which wasn't going to go to the osmiffinal the second season, and they also invested big amounts!
In view of the amounts invested, it would be possible to expect you to have 15 points in advance!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille Clubs, which failed too much in the last season, moved to another stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope we can smile in May and say that in spite of all the difficulties, we have succeeded in winning.
It seems that the PSG in everything depends on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimović.
It's a good thing it's said that there's a "dependence on the Golden."
This means that Ibrahimović is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proved to be the 1st league star.
Wherever he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect people and players on our team.
And he respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly remarkable.
This also led others to increase their own level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also enables others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with French representation?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, I couldn't play the way I imagined it would.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I can also play good games in representation.
And that's what I've been hoping for from my appearance to my representation.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good place to qualify for MS.
The coach picks hard, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is Remise (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us self-awareness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't experience such a game for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negative current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and costs for processing between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as it is often true of these technologies, there is a clear political outlook here: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to a financial crisis.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euros...), as well as a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
About a thousand websites are already accepting bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars, today it moves on the border of about ten dollars (the price overview is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "most successful virtual money", "competition dollar and euro" and "period of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money as it is used as "credit" for the process in video game that a person gets or can buy (and swaps back and forth).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all networks are depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user may choose another address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a two-key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is further possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is recorded in this new transaction in this book.
It is carried out by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers that the solver, such as a temporary central banker, will be entitled to write this additional line.
This is a phase of file cutting; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, then "cut".
The goal is to find the number that provides a specific print (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be irrefutablely displayed linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the print.
If the user wants to pay double the same money very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each one has a different print.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided into hundreds of millions, so the space for the margins here is...
The difficulty of the task is also increased by an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins were removed.
"The used collina does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a company for real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB is also monitoring the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also pays for cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of ordinary accounts and proved that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not running.
In November, "great discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or a non-contact payment by mobile, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
Moreover, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where no new terminals or software need to be installed.
Just communicate an address that can be photographed and identified on the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin settles, it will take some time, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB anticipates a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and the US units should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The worst damage was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 dead soldiers, and all of them are wounded and frozen.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who deny the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek, and the Tajiks have joined them.
Now they enjoy tolerance and often help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will diminish.
The departure of the French units from the Nijrab base, which I was following from the peaks of the mountains planted by mandlons through French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and tanked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on air escort helicopters.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, their unstoppable process changed significantly.
The cable was empty this time, and the land was in the blood and fire as a result of the fights between different groups of defenses.
Their takeover over the land was then regarded as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the blackout of these peasants, who completely controlled Al-Qa'id, but their situation has not improved until our time.
Some Mujahedins, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main war evaluators of Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became leaders, powered state land that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American orders for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves, and most of them were not even in battle.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people are looking for a government that won't make thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as they leave those who have been able to use American generosity: the escape of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and related ideologies.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they knew the modern world and were interested in its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five of the total population.
The cities are full of state schools, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to provide work, and they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; televisions and Turkish shows that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her head be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the Soviet army are already renewing provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a hilly country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation according to the Western model, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so there was the abolition of the prime minister's post, which existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzáí does not want foreign controls, especially when the elections are scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and early 1990s.
No industry has been able to restore, no overhaul is working, no basic wetting system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is made, but fruit and vegetables.
It's a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
They were disillusioned with the fact that Afghanistan has enormous unrelenting wealth.
And it only made me feel that the western states were here just to strengthen it.
Without energy to process iron or copper at the site and without means to transport raw materials through the mountains, but no extraction of non-growth can take place.
The Chinese have almost left behind the Mes Aynak Iron and have allowed international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) to explore a wide Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of the imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys' leagues, French universities, French institutes, military, legal, health and agricultural cooperation, support for archaeological delegations.
Since 2009, the "earning of the heart and soul" initiative has been working on the difficult task of settling aid and military activities, where the "civic-armed steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the numerous French non-governmental organisation of a series of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in the ten mountain villages.
These work, involving a number of local workers, helped to defuse the rise: moisture, cold, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of processing areas.
What kind of memory do we have after two billion euros of military spending?
Much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, often above 2,000 m above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written applications for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of foreign groups, they wish, according to their words, to achieve indirect civil assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí joined another poker party.
While Egypt remains the most widely distributed in its history due to the declaration of the constitution, which temporarily confers unlimited authority on it, he decided to play the vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, irrespective of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text.
A few weeks ago, the head of state gave this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been repeatedly supplemented, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's depravity.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president lingers in his "autocratic delirium", continues "disobeying his word" and "deprives the right".
However, his supporters assure us that this is a means of putting an end to the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and of speeding up the transitional process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will cause the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptian text to explain the article after the article.
It is also a way for the President to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests are being rejected throughout the country.
As he confirmed in his U.S. Weekend Time interview, Muhammad Mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this rapidly organised vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "You either approve my text or let me have unlimited powers," which should otherwise end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special air yesterday, 85 members of the said constitutional meeting with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most Liberals in the vote were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was declared, they knocked on the door with the fact that they did not have the opportunity to cast their opinions.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have made their move.
In order to achieve a degree of pride, 11 of the substitutes were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further stopped by the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours of prayer when some members of the committee stopped the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly arranged.
The text that was voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, remains at last consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of the law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped that it would replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would make it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is again a sign of their good will and respect for the rest of the Egyptian society.
"Covering," the Liberals who see only a verbal problem in it.
According to them, Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which entitles al-Azhar to the advisory role of the University, in particular on matters of monitoring compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommiere, it is disturbing because "people who are willing to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can watch the beginnings of the theocracy."
The concerns of the Liberals are even more alarming at the fact that the next principal of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not broke, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, they agree that "there may be disagreements regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein are part of the religious dictionary.
Here is in particular the reference to "fiqh" [Islamic Law].
And in the future, there may be a question as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to express themselves."
Yesterday's approved text, besides religious pages, is highly criticised for the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the authority of the armed forces.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the defence budget will not be verified by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
They will no longer be banned in military courts from dealing with civilians, as the Association for the Protection of Human Rights required.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they consider to be intended against freedom.
The criminal offence of slander is retained and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
Moreover, no article concerns the protection of women, emphasising Heba Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
That word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to perform on TV last night, the event is scheduled for this afternoon.
Then the state's leaders will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel are waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, world dolls and sea from saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the size of Bible truth, modern comfort, and the inexhaustibility of nature.
AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will fall upon all those who enter this “saint. ”
And Galilee - the place of the miracles of Jesus: the turning of the water into the wine at the wedding, the walking in the water, the calming of the storm, and the filling of nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers here will go through the Path of Pain or the Way of Jesus the Cross (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, it passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God at Mount Golgotha - to the place of the cross, to the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian doll of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree from which they made a cross to Jesus ’ crucifixion was planted.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - a wall of tools, the remnant of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different backgrounds leave a list of wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Raise Path to Vertical
The destruction of the fortress of Masada remained hidden from the enemy Herod the Great in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The castle is located on the slopes in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with horrors can reach it with their own strength.
The others will take the rope to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country is the famous Hermon ski resort at 1600-2040 m above sea level, which enjoys a huge flow of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported from the foothills of the mountain by a shuttle bus.
The total length of mountain ferries is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, they were supposedly living on the top of the hill of pagan gods.
Visit the unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit everyone on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea that were found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and further some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth visiting.
In his exhibition are widely represented impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha spa museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish swimming pools with the figures of the users of the spa and spa curators from that time.
There is a unique private Ralli museum in Caesarea where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or funerals with souvenirs.
Access is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Museum of the burnt offering or the Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
Enter inside - and feel in absolute darkness.
The stars are shaking.
And the names of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they were killed were heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aqua parks, dolphin and ocean.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, bathing can be done in the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it has people bathing all year round.
By the way, the dead sea is the most unique sea in the world, located at the lowest level of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azure water is a saturated salt solution that easily maintains the level of persons who cannot swim.
The surrounding area is unrealisticly beautiful.
Take care here to undergo treatment with salt water - solanacea, and a medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the faeces, diabetes, to heal your sweaty nerves.
Touch the Secrets of the Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through them.
The references to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved a beautiful Andromeda, who then lived a long and happy life together.
In fact, tourists love towels on the narrow streets, named after the signs of the beast.
It's said that if you press on to the walls in the "your" sign street, you'll be fortunately inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesar - in the city of King Herod - you can go through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesar was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontius Pilate.
Carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
On the way it is better to take the money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekel).
City transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem a fast tram rides and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically an underground wire track.
Traveling by all types of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can ride with a seat for 1.5 hours.
In Israel the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday, according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening to the sunset on Saturday, work on markets, trades and public transport ceases.
And Sunday morning starts work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef, pastries and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, the most diverse types of sauce, cakes from the milled cherry - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no bulldogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of fed cats here who gracefully "taste according to their taste".
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Passing cats love crowded places, and they're happy to be allowed into every good thing.
Car rentals will amount to $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Indicated numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To know the country and to rest came the most citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, the promised land visited 118.8 000 Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: immigrants will save their money in language
While MEPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been frauds in the country who sell "burnt" certificates
There are 13 million foreign workers coming to Moscow, Petrograd and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the Act entered into force, under which each migrant worker would be required to submit a test of knowledge of Russian.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, tests will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to people who successfully achieved the certification and obtained an academic degree in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of Puščinov Institute of Russian Language, Universities of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, State University in St. Petrograd and other Russian higher schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centres are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing has also been supported by Members of the Duma State and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to put many times into question: what does it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
So, above all, - according to migration service representatives - it will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "child labour."
Many people today are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russia's presidency in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
The only system of organised recruitment will be able to solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in immigrants without a profession, without education who do not know the language and have no medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev's conviction - a future migrant is doomed to encounter with dishonest people who, under the pretext of providing him with a "guide" to terrible, narrow dwellings where he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and drink for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise one thing to them in their power, but after arrival they will be cheated, they will have their passports, they will not pay the promised salaries," says the chief Tajik administration of labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't give up!
The less many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to become a job in Russia admit that they do not only know the language of the country they want to become, but have no experience even with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, as is the case: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks can afford to obtain at least a reasonable basic education.
For their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, groomed, and equipped for school.
As children grow to a productive age, they must be prepared for work on the first occasion.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and humiliated."
It is true that in view of the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Only those migrants who have legal status will be tested.
If they don't have it, they won't be tested, they won't get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live as illegal as they did in Russia.
"Welcome, or Uninvited entry prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalization is also worth money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we essentially have false documents, without registration, and that we have cases of extortion.
"They require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with reporters about his experience with the citizens of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be hungry, buy your paint"
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that there were not only documents of migrants on registration.
FMS employees have already had a number of false certificates on language examination.
The forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of testing, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will become migrant workers of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to ensure a system of anti-corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities have so far been able to promise foreign workers who have not passed the tests for the first time, the time needed to complete the course of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not own Russians are expected to work in areas where active contact with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) is not engaged in the illicit arms market
The proportion of criminal offences using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia proposes strengthening the law with regard to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: there have been cases of shooting at marriages that took place without a victim, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to prevent the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which weapons can be licensed - from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee of Irina Jarovaj, which promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State House in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the path of the screws.
An open letter appeared on the network, which the authors - representatives of various social firearms organisations - demand that the law be rejected "insensible affirmation".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasili Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in a discussion with the Russian BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed within six months in 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil weapons legislation does not accept the offenders to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, there is currently a low priced weapon available in Moscow.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from competitions by officers
The "Black" arms market is stockpiled with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot pages that accept arms orders
The first of them - "army or military road," that means a weapon that was cut off during the battles at the Caucasus.
"Arms have also been stolen by Russian officials and the Caucasians themselves," Baranec says.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of criminal authorities.
The illegal "mainly" comes for sale from military stocks.
Many military stockpiles often cause explosions.
"It has been proven that some fires were deliberately founded - to cover the gap," says the former soldier.
They make their contribution according to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers.
"At present, private military companies are emerging which are not competitive on the international market and are decomposing weapons that are supplying them to the black market, including Moscow," said this expert.
Another source of the "black" market is poaching.
In particular, a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their product, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there's a mafia that organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and the Design of Public Administration.
Experts have analyzed the records of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature and the data of the public data portals on the subject of weapons.
Most illegal weapons are reported by investigators, from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "to blame official agents whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the weapons were stolen during their production, and 5% were "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the arms trades that asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the mines of black "archaeologists" are no longer bought long ago - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, salesmen drive for new shipments directly into military warehouses.
Through the counter, the interested party buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You'll order a gun with him, and he'll sell it to you through the fence.
"He will take her to the city and sell her there for 900 euros a piece with two warehouses," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the picture, and therefore whenever they start burning a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will carry out a control purchase in the case of dealers with illegal weapons," the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I've been visiting websites and blogs until there's a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Experience" platform, where there's going to be a man who would lead me to the "cat" where we're going to act together.
The price I found out most of the time
Military rapporteur Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, a salesman will tell me.-- I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him completely.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovice who asked me to make sure my daughter got out of the tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He's also giving it to me because he knows I'm not giving it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a publication stand on this subject.
The scheme has not changed according to his words.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "everything you thought".
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls a soldier.
To the buyer, according to Baranèce, they do not offer rabbits in the pot - you can try anything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - let's go with the salesman to the woods and set ourselves a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that a gun is shooting well, we start acting," says a knowledge expert.
Container on the couch
Search engines will bring you to "Contact" websites and groups where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"Just have a certain amount of money," they write in an advertisement title on the website "Buying a gun or automatic".
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sell the minor?
"Of course, without a license," the user asks Ivan.
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" -- the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a vast network of targeted websites, and people who want to buy military weapons can use a sword.
People eat like hungry fish on bait and then get coal on Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Senior Military Commissioner Viktor Baraněc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer will make the payment via the ATM.
"In response to this, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions where the weapon is hidden," says a press spokesman of the NGO "The Right to Arms" Dmitrij Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after ordering on the website, you can remain unarmed and feel behind the grids.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a vast network of targeted websites, and people who want to buy military weapons can use a sword.
"People eat like hungry fish on the landing and then get coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Macarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms, you will normally pay from $100 to $900 according to experts' estimate.
According to Dmitrija Acidova, from the NGO "The Right to Arms", you will arrange the Makarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon shall be dispatched from long-term storage funds through the medium-term storage funds of the article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7% in October 2011 compared to the period of January and made 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and expulsion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fixed-food and supermarket workers retire
Work on a well operated "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart and fast-food restaurants such as McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far no one can predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine or whether it will soon disappear.
All of this is supported by committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by a number of Walmart workers and in fast feeding systems, the aim of protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually free of the influence of the board.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, in so-called "black Friday", when America was hit by cheap sales orgy, attracted millions of people and in some cases was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some Walmart workers, who work around the world for 2.2 million people, have left their workplace and demonstrated together with the trade chains companies and the left-wing activists of multinational companies whose goods are targeted by people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything all over the world, from lungs through hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages at Walmart stores only buy themselves at work.
Availability and product range made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply because he only pays little to his employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a raise in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the company increased rapidly from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Typical worker Walmart gets $9.5 an hour, but it doesn't correspond to the amount of expenditure, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley report that if Walmart increases its average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost $3.2 billion a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than this company is paying now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will lose about $1.39 more than today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest was carried out in only nine countries, and the company should not cause any damage.
"Black Friday" in the company's sales lasted from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, her assets were made on "black Friday" of nearly 100 million transactions.
Dan Fogelman, a representative of Dan Fogelman, said in a left-wing discussion on the Huffington Post website that the workplace had left "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all "further media sensation" organised by the committees.
"Unoccupied treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's commercial houses (they in the city of progress are not too in shape, and are therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of dollars, and then he doesn't pay you sick and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York City
Currently, minimum wages are paid for work in accordance with federal laws and with New York State regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants increase this wage gradually, but only slightly, and on average, they receive their number of employees in New York at $8.90 an hour.
Nobody in this precious town has a lower salary.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Employment at "McDonald" will last almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind a desk after school for part-time thinking and living with their parents.
Only a few people are watching their main source of food or planning to stay there for too long.
I'm still meeting with McDonald employees who complain that they have to live with this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests that began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and at Madison Avenue demanded that treasurers and cooks in fast-cleaning establishments start to get at least $15 per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of expert organisations in the area of rapid nutrition.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the establishment of trade union organisations and the punishment of trade union activists by harassment and release.
On the other hand, administration is often a means of making life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult to introduce in fast-cleaning establishments for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Unmatched
This day there were loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The performance of this event was at the "McDonald's" afternoon meeting near Times Square, where several local democratic policies emerged, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said: "McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to work together to support the hard food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times magazine described, it was the greatest event of its kind in the history of the American field of fast nutrition.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were fast nutrition employees who employ tens of thousands in New York.
Whether this event will become a flash that will light the flame of mass movement is still unclear.
"I'm going to be able to cheat on average"
Among the fans of modern virtual reality technologies is the popular theme of expanded reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially across the borders of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google presented the working model of this news and in November it was announced that the application for the patent in question had also been submitted to Microsoft.
From a discussion with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Shararem Izadim, it turns out that for scientists of this company, glasses are already past.
It is easier to see how virtual objects are manipulated in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us framework, what is your research group doing?
We're dealing with man's interactions with machines, but at the same time we're trying to move the boundary of this interaction.
So far, mankind's work has been suspended in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, sometimes affecting the screen toe.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect recorder - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect recorders, because for everyone there is a very interesting possibility to manage using gestures.
- What else is in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has transferred the interaction to the physical level, a lot of interactions are still taking place on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input stream has improved (the system accepts a larger amount of data), but the output stream has not been particularly so far.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the users but also the space around them.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think about voting control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it appreciated?
- Of course you can't think of him as a hero - there is a question of privacy, because we don't always want to inform others in our neighborhood about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, in order to control the facilities in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not about confused, only of such general, short ones.
At the same time, the gesture would not be seen as a camera of the device, but as a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far he's big, but theoretically he can be reduced to the size of the bracelet clocks.
Generally speaking, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemonade box?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to take the users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on developing new types of recorders that will be able to find out more precisely how a person reacts.
These may be laser sensors, for example, that provide a relatively good deep resolution, which is very important.
- If you want to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution today, depth, or anything else?
- Actually, the current generation - that's what we can do in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, it's like the mother and the deep.
At present, all current technology is insufficient for us - this gives work to algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of images per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows 30 images per second are honestly little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betshees from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch-on camera with a adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current serially manufactured sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects a person's interaction with the machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I don't just need so much touch, but I need some pictures in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a regular tape recorder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue system Kinect, play by bending the camera position and see how it will help to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (other than Google) didn't present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that when it comes to the everyday use of technology expanded reality using special glasses, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course walking and constantly holding the smatphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be the "transport" kind of expansion of reality if it could be possible on the basis of the cloud platform to switch off any of the glasses on the smartphone, projection display and further along.
Bryl - this is a very personal device, in which there is their strength (in particular things you see only you), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also to the ordinary mortal.
There's one problem that critics often point out: there's no response!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality is the seventh one following the gap in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of material perceptions could easily become an eighth breakthrough.
One of the interesting tricks is now being used - the use of the other hand as a kind of basis for visualization.
Excellent way to record the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding fattility to these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasound pencils in the defined point, where the finger is located, creates a feeling of mass, but it's still very weak - as if you're staring at your fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects nervous endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - like taking a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running paths (not least those like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
If brain mutilation becomes a goal, work is still for many years.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are at the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is the continuation of the project "Petrogradska avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are in charge, are avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list there have already been significant figures of the Petrostadt scene, whose profits go beyond the city, they often find recognition in Europe without reaching the full volume.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known by Cyril Miller - a man dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion fairs and at the paint fairs.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are displayed, always attract the crowds.
Cyril Miller is one of the pure social and philosophical four-city artists, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is an imaginary man of the Petrograd avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets provokes smiles on the faces of citizens, increases all the mood.
He recently took the bottles into his hands and became a petro-urban bottlemaker because he had grown up to this complex role throughout his godly life, philosophy, and image.
Cyril, why are you going all over town in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I've chosen a red color as a designer dealing with looks and images.
In this world a red color represents a compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that differs slightly from gray is aggressive and induces bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on having a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevska, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, the wave of old free and informal artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonese who brought us to "Pusčinska 10", and there were no other waves.
It makes it easy for me to watch, dress, music, all genres except the word.
- And all of this came together in your art clinic... - It was important for me to feel at the centre of Petérburk culture where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995, I settled in Puškinské 10, and there was a musical-art club, a Bohemian club, a home for the Peterburk Bohém.
There were many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Schnura was brought up with the project "Echo Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang a light song, dressed in handy shirts, among them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has led many programs of Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, starting his great career, basic education, and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our workers left and our guests stay.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in print, and the special price was "People in Our City".
In the nomination of "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, so my peak ended.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristicly recognizable.
- Many of my images - these are hits in which life is caught up to time and insight.
I'll have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
The clowns are overtime.
I used to be social, it's painful and terrible today.
But in clowns, everything's out. Tragic.
I love grotesque, I love grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of totalitarian restructuring in order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focus on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't put your hand on him and you should spit in his face.
And deception will be removed by wearing it.
- We recently saw you as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who would he be if I didn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactile, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
The people used to meet in the noises, the goddess loved one, the simple other people.
Today it's all broken down into a micro community, today it's very difficult to enjoy everything.
I'm not a stadular banker to like everything.
Today we need to think about who you like.
Today every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to Stas Michael's!
- He's got fans, he's got a sexual social affair.
And there will be 300 people on the cultural grounds, and 10 thousand will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything's rusty.
I've got fans, and the main thing is that nobody lets them down and doesn't break what's alive.
When I was young, I painted images that were hanging on a wall with Falke and Lario.
I started with images that most people end up with.
Today people often get confused.
They say:Culture spiritual, culture consumer.
There's no culture of consumerism, it's obnoxious.
I'm a man of culture yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, turned down money for painting images.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: a factor through culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
During the time of the proper emperors, it was not so in everything, the emperors may not have understood too much of the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petrograd who could be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because there's a need for great experts who properly assess these experts and guide them on the right path.
Today, tastes prosper.
The same Erarta, but it's different than being honestly saying that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for another museum.
- What do you think Petérburk is?
- Petérburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's the right ground.
And on our top art works poorly.
We need cultural land, but today we have writers more than readers, that's wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
We only have a layer like this.
We need art to become fashionable things, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented through the St.Peterburk grant
Rodit Into the Universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landowners on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: How to keep your family free of stress or on a given surrogate planet?
I don't think the choice is that big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars," says a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While Mars has better conditions for life, on the surface of Venus they reach temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is possible only at high altitude or orbit of Venus... in the universe.
The question of reproduction in the universe began with a flower.
Tests on plants have been carried out half a century ago.
Four generations of game grown on a circular track is nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then we carried out the extraction of manure into orbit - very small fruit males of Drosophil.
In 1979, the hatchlings were sent into space to verify the development of the embryo in a state of ease.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the way out.
But then problems start.
"The problem is that this bird has to find resistance, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they can't find the resistance, the birds are chaotically falling and making cobblestones.
After 10 hours, freshly peeled birds came to a complete discoloration of the instincts.
The birds didn't respond to the light or the sound.
And the problem was they just died within four days.
"We let the birds out twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" flew on a round track 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but they'll only be the beings of one sex.
He's been experimenting with encounters that were being sent to space already pregnant.
They basically didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on earth, the cosmic rats were born a offspring.
However, closer to the problem of multiplication directly in the universe has not yet been achieved.
It's a hard task.
Animals, when they lose their normal environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is governed by abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The most dangerous threat was the Tereshkov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Teak flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if he'd fly into space.
Is he able to have a baby after such a year?
"No one has answered this question yet," says a veteran of the Wachtang Vacandze missile-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Téreskov's daughter was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut of Andrjan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Saví, was born, who visited the orbit twice, and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts that have been born after many years and are growing in offspring' health.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says the cosmonaut-pilot, the Soviet Union's hero and Russian hero Valerij Poljakov.
Nevertheless, mankind must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, under the conditions of zero attraction, the cosmonauts acquire the habits needed to work in open space.
Water imitates the state of ease.
Although for adults the water is either comfortable but in its strange environment, for young children it is a natural life.
Little hunters seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There's a connection between having a child on average 9 months in the mother's fertile water and then making it easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of first purchase, it will only last 2 weeks.
"It's very little for the child to forget something," says Marina Axenov's Newborn swim instructor.
In short - if the condition of a newborn is more natural for a newborn, then for women it is more natural inevitable gravity, attractive force.
In a state of stress, it occurs very quickly to pollinate the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pancreas, reduces the body’s ability to fertilize.
We can leave this to the side if muscle stimulaters function at birth.
At the end of the day, it is possible to have a baby in a special chamber in which the mother’s organism produces fruit.
"And what else?" asks Valerij Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by earth’s attractiveness, it cannot properly shape the bone or the muscle system.
Newborns on a circular track cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit, they are loaded into which they could be trained.
He'll just get rid of what he absolutely needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthy person on Earth who will be totally unadapted to the present environment," predicts the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
However, one day the time will come when the earth will become a reality and the earth’s inhabitants will spend in their shells on a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born into the universe.
Head of NKU: Control of the black system has been blamed on politicians
In relation to public contracts, Czech Republic has a good controller and quality legislation, but in its application.
In the discussion for Aktuálná.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Authority Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate the joint control of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of mispractice, Peter's approach to the so-called "swarming system" is suggested.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently said that ODS will not trouble the business with its controls - so is it prohibited or permitted?
"The law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, neither can the President of the government prevent the exercise of the authority that is required to exercise control and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Poslanek House, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was it?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is dealt with, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and even though the control is not yet completed, we have found very interesting differences - legislation in general is possible even "harder and more perfect", yet the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not necessary to continue to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to apply the law itself.
What can this project actually do for you, what it will do for you?
Such joint control could help us stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits if it does not have such a positive effect.
Economy means to obtain the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, if necessary, criminal conduct.
But by lowering the limit on contracts, we don't necessarily have to achieve it.
Maybe the system pays so much "paper" that those who want to find holes in that system will draw much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about foreign problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office like our NKU, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, such as the NKU, the Bundesrecungnungshof, which is organized as we are, also has a college, it is only in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are doing the same.
Powers are to some extent similar, however, because Germany has social arrangements, so it also has these accounting courts at the level of individual social countries - in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control the cash of the government presented to us.
Public funds that are managed by countries and foreigners are controlled there from the level of community accounts.
As for darker legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is designated as a model, but it cannot certainly be said that it is better at all.
So it's also necessary to have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm telling you again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model face a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a good thing for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for foreign legislation, which meant a new law on public procurement for your office, does it have any effect?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet evident in the control actions.
Because we're doing ex-post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We have seen this only so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new instrument of "detecting risks of non-economicity", through which we have found almost 14,000 public procurements, and we have analysed them - there will naturally be changes, because the limits change, the conditions of some types of choice are adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be more of a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that she's strict rules and won't be able to abide by them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, persons controlled are already bound by the supplier (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of the budgetary penalty.
So does the law have the value of affirming this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who will be allowed to make formal doubts that have no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how'd you get out of this?
Let's show ourselves where the road isn't going.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently said that ODS will not make it difficult for the business to control the so-called "black system" - and what does that mean?
Is the black system prohibited or allowed?
However, the law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, neither can the President of the government prevent the activities of the authority which is required to exercise control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and let it happen," but he can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the law on public contracts there are relatively strict rules as to what is formally to be done - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the best bidder is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what we think is missing.
Roads are places of brick, most of them but starry
In several places the Czech Republic has roads that are paved and also snowy.
Most of them, though, are driving by themselves, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovar Region
In the region of Karlovar, the roads were paved and snowy this morning.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but should be slightly warmed during the day.
Snowing has risen in the region and there is only a weak layer in the bottom.
However, on the hills of the Krušna Mountains there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The locations were also less visible due to mud, resulting from data from the dispersal of local roadmen.
The R6 motorways and first-class communication are now in the region with no restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges where the surface may be smooth and smooth.
The stars are also all paths of the second and third class including mountain roads.
But in some sections there are still residues of frozen and frozen snow.
Above all, more attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubic and Royal Town Country
On some roads in eastern Czech Republic there is a threat of freezing, in higher places and on the mountains there may be a snow layer caught in the communications, it informs the Directorate of Roads and Roads on its pages.
Motorists warn drivers from freezing, it can be created in particular in the higher positions of the Pardubian region.
The features can be around Lanškroon, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicals are treated on roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orli.
The sheltered snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the periods of Richnov nad Knežna and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, it is most common today to make it clear that there are no collisions.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsia, weak wind.
Plzeň Country
Roads in the Plzeň Region are in the morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing after the morning, temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be inferred.
The driver's seats must also be counted with the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
It comes from the information sent by the local roadmen.
The D5 distance is almost unrestricted, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeň and Tachovsk, there may be frozen cuts.
Communication of the second and third classes shall be damp and in this case shall also be given notice of the seedlings.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the area of Shumava.
Olomuký Country
With the snowfall on the road today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc region must be counted.
After the chemical sepsis, she stayed on the Red Sea saddle and on the road towards the Videlska Cross.
On the night of snowfall, motorists drove into the field, some three inches [3 cm] of snow, according to road managers.
In other parts of the country, the cars are mostly as low as possible.
"Shumper is in the highest position of the rest of the snow.
With the snowfall on the Red Mountain saddle, drivers must count towards Jeseník," the ČTK dispatcher of the road administration said today.
To the ground at night, their colleagues went to Jesenick, the roads to the highest places are now according to them after chemical treatment naked and wet.
In Olomouck there are roads that are unrestricted, but in Sternbersk drivers should be careful in forest areas where cars remain wet.
Oral country, Liberecian country
Right after the morning, a few difficult landings are reported by roadmen in northern Czech Republic.
In addition to several snow-snowed or ice-cold areas, the mountain road from Telnice na Knínice na Ústecka is also closed, resulting from the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero, so ice and snow are probably on the roads.In the lows, especially south-east of the Czech Middle East, there are no problems, and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The ice-creams are reported by roadmen especially from around Štěti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - through the day of rain and snowing, in the night clear and cold.
Out of the main movements, adverse conditions are also reported on road I/13 between the Usteck and the Liberian country.
The plant from the Institute at the Knínica was opened by the curved branches of trees that, under the snow, turned to the driver.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think should happen to the end of the world in a few months?
It's just one of the other scary news that we people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap we make more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to distance or prevent it from the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will organize a fully unified project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a state-wide benefit action that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
3 concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava on 20 December from 21 hours ago.
They will end about the time when the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the 12-hour time zone before us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was probably my idea, and then we made it all up with our artist Honzo August.
In addition to wanting to collect enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which this world will be handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we also created a unique collection of boots, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world that people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is abolished".
She's very fond of YouTube today, will she also sing at these charity concerts?
Of course, and that's in the absolute conclusion, if we can't do it and the end of the world doesn't happen...
All the performers sing it at all three concerts at the same time.
The Hymnas are suddenly also connected in a unique direct transmission on Czech television.
He wrote the words for this song and the main role of Jesus in the video plays Tomáš Hanák, also singing Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out most of them are interested in our cooperation and fun.
What will be the outcome of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the Barrier Education Centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the Civil Society Tap in the Jedlikov Institute.
For students of schools Jedlikkov's Institute there are regular lecturers and they are involved in activities that are fun and interesting.
The students themselves don't have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we're trying to allow them this way.
As part of the construction of the Jedlik Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to move to with this project.
There will be a number of musical groups and performers at each concert.
What did you pick them for?
We have tried to establish a programme that will address all generations, including children.
For example, Chinese, Support Lesbians, Illustrateosphere with Dan Barto, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
For more details, see www.kpks.cz.
You're planning a similar "bomb action" to the future?
In May we will be performing in Prague for the first time, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here.
Next year we'd also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we're in the United States, would like to connect it with the performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, for example, you've been out in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric car, her cars have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we're pulling a lot of cargo and a lot of tools...
However, until now it has always worked out without problems, ČSA and British Airways have been very prepared for us that I have been amazed many times.
Even in Moscow, which we recently returned from, it was no problem.
You can compare how individuals differ in barriers, public access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that everything in the east is still in full swing.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, where it is still unusual for people on the electric car to move themselves in the city centre.
It doesn't even apply the kind of self-esteem you need to give to the driver in the lift.
Fortunately, there are civil associations that are trying to alert people to the problems of poverty.
And what else do we still have to pursue a more prosperous country?
There are a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improvement and improvement are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move on their own to the public, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not too common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or freedom of expression is one thing, but only when we are important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things are really going to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Chapel is currently very popular, but let's go back in a few years, what led you to start it in 1998?
I went as a educator to Jedlik's institution, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing the saxophone, so I started an interesting music club with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ládź Angelovic says, we got a little out of hand.
But the popularity has come to the last few years, or am I wrong?
The truth is, it helped us when we began to connect with famous singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
It turns out that work that is not visible is essentially as if it didn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality speakers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to touch it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
The show business is full of things where one resembles the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken care of, and it's been going on for a long time.
Things that are isolated are very few, but I'm hoping to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a meaningful life and develop, of course, provided that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a move for them, it's a move for the whole society.
Did this success also help you to be a strong boss, as many people have called you?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic imagination and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, come to the preparation and spend a lot of time on the concerts, the excitement is quickly gone.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently the band The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it can't be stopped.
Whoever has the will and the will, has always a door open to us
The day before the expected end of the world will take place on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédé and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities connect to the telemosto at the end of the evening when the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the world is cancelled"
The purpose of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free training centre STUDEO at the Jedliksk Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is CZK 400, children under 12 have free pre-sale tickets Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency at the meeting of the Ministers of the Countries of the European Space Agency, as the second country of the former Eastern bloc (by the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
However, Poland's journey to the cosmos began a long time ago.
For years, the Poles were devoted to the cosmos before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I recall the lecture by A. Sternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pre-eminent work Enter into the cosmonaut.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltierie and André Louis Hirsch's admission to the Cosmonautique in France in 1934.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great advocate of astronomy and cosmonautism.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadovski became a world-renowned propagandist of cosmonautics, and his benefit was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the twisted side of the moon was named after him.
By 1925 a railway station had been built in Poland, which was to be operated by a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are unknown.
It is not clear whether the rocket should have been used to drive the drain or to freeze it.
Information on this drain is only known from the time stamp.
Since 1933, the use of rockets has been taking place in the hands of Polish firefighters.
The research provided the Cell of Arms Technology in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From stored materials it is evident that research has grown into a stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted by research.
In 1937, a proposal for a photoelectric landing rocket was published in the expert press by Rohozinski engineer and in the following year the work of the rocket - air torpedo and rocket bomb by the author of the Leliwy-Krzywoblocký.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war with all the projects of military use of missile technology, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory Committee) coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the war ended.
Further work by the cosmonauts after the war in the Polish press is revealed thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Poland Astronautics Society).
For the first time, there is a mention of the company in the November 1954 issue of The Problem magazine, in which four more comprehensive articles are devoted to astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, the projects of artificial families were already under way, and it was clear that space research was a perspective.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been trying to enter the International Astronaut Federation (founded 1951) and has become a member of the PTA in the autumn.
And in the following year, PTA President Kazimier Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
This function was stopped until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of highly successful meteorological rockets RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to be conducted by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on October 10, 1958.
The 1,800-metre-access rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was not exactly 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledov Desert in 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should have been able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have access to up to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring the high wind.
However, further development was halted in 1962.
Meteor-1 was developed in 1962 to 1965 as a successor to the first RM-type rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-degree rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which vary in size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket space was available with a volume of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting mass of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later are still to be mentioned.
Poland was also involved in space research in Soviet artistic families within the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The resolution sparked a lively debate among the public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
The principle of free trade and freedom of movement of private capital together with unconditional financial speculation is a reason.
With the impact of significant differences in the price of work, (wages) comes into price tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer is trying to import cheap goods to remain in the competition by "stimulating" the price of the competitor in order to cut its market share and thereby increase its own profits.
In a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer the product to abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other high economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus also the responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state is necessarily increasing.
The whole situation reinforces the absolute unwillingness of the businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensates the economic and social damage he suffered in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with a view to reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital a chance to their own population regardless of the social downturn.
This is reflected primarily in the amendments to the applicable laws.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept a priced private capital dictatorship, especially in the area of wages.
However, this is done by a system of economic recovery in the case of long-term unemployment, but by limiting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
There have been a number of years in the SRN public food surpluses for the poor who cannot take advantage of their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive wages so that they must be paid to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees in the public sector.
Practically all EU southern states have no doubt led to the same state of affairs when people are forced to migrate either as in the 19th century or to live on a hungry wage on the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually come to the country.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, or Turkey, Morocco, or Egypt, or Africa are still working for a European wage break.
It's all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capital in its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital is of the opinion that the State must not interfere with the management of the economy.
Then we need to ask ourselves whether private capital is not affected, it is now actually running politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
There's a clear answer here, yes.
Evidence is practically omnipotent and in all states there is a lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where virtually everything is punishable, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, there is a situation where state ministries for the lack of financial resources require the development of draft laws to private legal firms that are lacking in connection with industry.
These draft laws are then passed in Bundestag.
Not all come from the people as Western constitutions report, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianos describes in his part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in full interpretation and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For bribery, illegal acquisition and by means of stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were without any ban and people went to elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."The character people did not at all act about the office, so once as a result of this revolution it was eight months without consular." . . . . . . . began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in the bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to choose an energetic man." Appianos, however, thought of Pompey, but became Caesar, who turned it into a permanent democracy for self-government.
The conclusion As in the past, the present company is based on an independent preference for its own benefit regardless of the general interest.
Private capital is no longer, in its essence, capable of understanding and applying the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, just like then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort at all to reform a deeper race.
The causal of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the disproportionate liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At present, the decline in these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break with the expectation of another wheel.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites completely ignore in the future possible statistical losses in lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are now witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of economic competition at both international and internal European levels, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is aimed at political and social reforms that strengthen the state's participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos lab.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never come out of it" Sting in the song of Fragile, whose main verse in the refrene is "let's not forget how we are sinners"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no "Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were many reactions.
One stands behind Israel, argues his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue against the Israeli state racism, genocide in Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodically recurring waves of guilt killing and who is the victim, at the end of the day, Israelis, including their own right territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
This is what I want to offer our readers a view of the tire, a view of who has been serving for 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts some of them are driven by my own understanding of who the group of people is the main contributor to the events of modern history.
The actions of mankind are, first of all, the stories of the struggle of power.
In every age we can look at some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether they were always these personalities who were totally autonomously driving their steps and whether someone was standing behind their throne pointing their actions towards the stated goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and its power cannot come to life for one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the head of the funeral (if someone is still standing above them, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
It doesn't write much about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) had already purchased in the 1990s to stop linking its name to the high criminal effects in which they were constantly in the background, which always meant strengthening power, increasing wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all of the world's central banks and against countries where central banks don't fight or prepare war (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5 countries, after Caddafi's overthrow there were only four, but between Russia the central bank was subordinated to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank of Rothscheld Bank of America, began to spend his own (understanding government) money during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to destroy the Fed, was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the big economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars by the highest tower, the 33rd degree dedication of Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to remove large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was intended to remove the colonial empire in particular of Great Britain, and the third is intended to reduce the world population to some 0.5 - 1 billion people (such numbers of slaves are sufficient for their convenience and luxury and do not need so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pretext for such a solution) and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families in front of Rothscheldy is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED foundation, so that the crisis does not repeat itself as it did in 1907).
So after they succeeded in the assassination of the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to wage the first world war, the Emperor Russia was destroyed by the launching of the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, military and economically unresolved, capitalising Germany (there was no longer a need for a war to destroy the Czar Russia) and subsequently broke the central European power, Austria.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, policy bankers have allowed the latent conflict situation to be created by imposing enormous war repairs on Germany, creating a prerequisite for radicalisation of the mass of survivors and then just giving the Germans sufficient emphasis on the strong, guilty and simple solution of the proposed leader and further creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who was to fight and fight, the function of the fifth pillar, in the pursuit of a warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild Foundation of the Zionist Movement, which one saw to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea and Jerusalem as the main city (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration provided an example of the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first encounters with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler withdrew from the chain where he was originally held by international bankers or all he had done was hard to estimate, however, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration was a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs of Germany were won in World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel created a fire of war.
If the international bankers succeed in disbanding it, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be victims in the first line of the fight, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of chaos and chaos not only within the country, but also within the international dimension (let's just consider how hard people are sharing the favor and support of Israel).
Who is the culprit, and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the violence results from the infinity of violence when at first the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood?
There is a need to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are urging people to choose their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascising, international bankers of loyalty, which is doing everything in its power to break down the war with Iran, which, due to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to increase in global conflict and because of Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, which travels 20% of all world oil (only 2 miles wide) and to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new birth is implanted at the birth of a chip, which will make it a fully controlled being.
"And force all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves to have on their right hand or on the head of the cups so that they can not buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the golem or the number of its name.
You have to understand that: who has the sense to count the numbers of the scrolls.
That number denotes a person and it's a number sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, he held an American embassy in Tehran to demonstrate Islamic students and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be replaced by the release of Mohammed Réz Pahalvi, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, who was the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive outlook - throwing a chess across the board could not afford, because it would thus, in principle, threaten the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution set in motion a theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was a morning for the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the failure of an attempt to release by force.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the negotiation was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their contribution at home led to a wave of solidarity and an anti-Irrawaddy sentiment.
The debate in Iran made a significant contribution to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy was demolished, six employees fled.
After the complex peripecies, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them from Iran, while the extravagance cover story - went to Canadian passports as a member of the film staff who watched the location in the country for filming a big movie.
Combination of genres
A plan that invented an expert on "exfiltration" Tony Mendez also required Hollywood cooperation.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, a press conference was held, a fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, and the film comes from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly conceived political thriller, at the same time called "caper motion", the story of the lost piece, the horror - can be an example of Danny's series of partners.
In this way, the moods are intertwined - on the one hand, a documented sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows the iconic time photographs of events and the way in which the same situation was presented in the film - great differences in them).
On the other hand, the remote passage from Hollywood, combined with irony and a mild resurgence.
And then there are scenes from the CIA and other institutions - men in the clothes are discussing the situation at the acting tables, at the office halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has successfully relaunched his career in a remarkable way.
He became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third full-night film, after the dark crimes of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the Thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it's Afleck's first video that doesn't take place in Boston's director.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the directors' older films had increased above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows him in Arga, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets when actual events are reconstructed - the initial sequence of the drop of the embassy is effective in its transparency, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and ignorance that arise when somewhere clear moves history.
The similar effect of Affleck and his collaborators is achieved in scenes of thought (false staff at the Tehran base).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of the scenes.
He's working pretty well with it, sometimes he'll think of the reality - everything is no longer so elegant (the scene in which a dangerous crisis at Tehran airport turns the phone into a phone call in America and the honiča on the edge is quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the dissolution resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charamant in the role of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not far from the film.
Afleck's film thus loses a little dramatic movement, it's a picture that can be followed with a mild interest, evaluate the realization and retro style evocating thrillers in the 1970s.
It's just hard.
As a reminder of one way or another of living history and evidence of how exaggerated the ideas about all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but enough.
Rules for spraying balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankopopakky.com, which announces annually a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to declare a competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It led us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the law organizer of the Patrik Nacker survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women is already one of the absurdities.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote alone will then take place by the end of February 2013," Naker informed.
The contested EU regulation also requires the mandatory incorporation of biomaterials into trace materials, which is detrimental to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury temperatures only because they contain relatively small quantities of dangerous substances or the directive on the size of the blind cells, which has made the eggs significantly expensive this year.
Criticism had previously also faced a factual ban on the use of the term anointed butter or the removal of classical lamps from the sale.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of that or those commercial or industrial lobby whose requirements in Brussels usually concern some State or group of States (the Czech Republic now and the threat of veta is promoting the requirements of its banks).
Lobby loans were also due to the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and should not show an "anomaly curve".
The European Commission has, however, defended itself by only harmonising the existing disunity of national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables already in the EU have softened over the resistance of some countries, indicating that the existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be the EU last year's regulation, which requires the mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 should not be harassed without adult supervision.
The EU has been referring here to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of the deaths of children inhaling.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children under 14 years of age when smoking in pajamas.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd, then, that the rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia and must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece.
The Bankovníkopakka.com server, in cooperation with the Laissez Faire Liberal Economies Association, has appointed a survey in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdity regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU set the maximum quantities of food stocks that could be found in the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, certain volumes of preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with high pain.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for having no sea and the idea of granting grants at the request of receiving a grant.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that we had a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, there was to be full stocks that he had to export.
For the Czech Republic to continue to seaports, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission went out to join the Czech Republic in organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive the grant was offered to the Municipal Ministry for Local Development managed by Minister Pavl Germany (US-EU), which should specifically go to the registration of a request for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bilateral regulations are an exception
However, the regulations in the Member States are easily criticised, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve greater recognition, according to a number of experts.
The most important problem, according to experts, is for example to draw EU grants on projects that do not have a sign of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have used in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic is also exacerbated by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, and not always succeeds in this match.
Although the Czechs, after six hundred years of fighting with the Germans and the Rakušanys, took up the name of the fragments, but the foreign rum, whose tradition reaches us by the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as foreigners.
The name of the rum may be carried only products of trimming distillate, not of sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, the world-famous cheeses of feta and gorgonzol, marzipan from German Lübeck or parm ham have already been found, for example, carlovar sugar, peat and hazelnut cap and hazelnut.
The EU's brand of protection can also be proud of pardubic wigs and hot tubs.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Ocamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I wouldn't go anywhere.
But I can't see how the country's been stealing for the last 20 years, how the thieves are running, people are raising taxes and ages of retirement.
I shouldn't have been an ambitious politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I've been forty years old and I'm an independent non-partner, I have no other way of affecting things than running for a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've gone to the Garden.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying that I've been going to the Battle of the Garden as a result of the Senate elections.
Later I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I'd be running for president.
My goal is but it's not a function, it's a tool to make my vision come true.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we give in the house and on television, but that we will drown everyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, there are media that dehonest people and that distort freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I was supposed to say that I was paying the press or that I was Jiri Paroubka's advisor.
Let's go to your visions.
You've gone into the fight for the Garden with the same heavy and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of assets over 20 million.
You have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for guidance to be free living, it worked.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or to the right, they reject it, and it keeps citizens from doing so.
As an independent non-participator, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that without page-scattering and dogmat I can take something that's best for our country, on each side and apply it.
Do you think you're more of a righteous man or a left man?
From a Czech point of view, I think people are looking at me on the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all whether it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I'll always support any public good solution, even if it's proposed by KSCM or ODS, and I'll be against the wrong idea anyway.
You fuck if someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have talked about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have the passwords left.
And that's not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, you will be able to impose punishment and heavy responsibility on them?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side so that we can sit down.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I would ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate a substantial and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want her.
If there is a strong person who calls himself a bad person, you can press on to the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice. It was a public pressure.
On the level, I say I'm an amateur, that I'm not either a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find an ally.
I just started in politics, and I'll try to get most of the support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it's not gonna work out, in six years I'm gonna end up and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know I'm not gonna do anything in one person, so I've heard from a number of well-known people if they wouldn't even run into the Senate.
I've been following Radim Janchuru, who for the sake of the amount of work he refused.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who was exposing frauds with light-smelling oils.
I've been running with the fact that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of those who went chose the establishment representatives.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult to prosecute.
Still, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct choice of the mayors or the Heitmans.
You think you're setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the pure past of every potential party, and I don't have the money.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign. My transparent account is only 20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate private property for about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and Shkoda Superb of a million, and then I have a few million on account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyfriend's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against bad and bad.
You're driving Aston Martin, you have 60 million property and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to give your own money too much.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
I've put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that my program is probably not so interested.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign is essentially what I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't get rid of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't go anywhere.
So you're gonna keep running so you can live?
Didn't you say you're gonna do this?
But it doesn't relate to the amount of pay.
As I promised, I've partially ruined my activities.
For example, my representative will become a travel agent in spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How many of you as a businessman have you been used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400 grand, which I'm taking on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find the whole conversation in the law issue on Saturday.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example Spijkennies and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems to me happy, it seems futuristic. Finally, it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big company, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-fashioned books are going to volunteer today, are they?
Spijkennies, a location close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education across the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision fell to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges that are displayed on euro banknotes.
The success of the education offensive was not at all repugnant.
And so the city councillors knew that there was already only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wines Maas from the Rotterdam architectural workshop MVRDV, master of crazyly bold column graphs and designer of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with normal calm and at a competition meeting in 2003 appeared with five books under the cover and on the face.
And while the commission was still looking tremendously around and screaming its shoulders, Maas poured out his gifts on himself according to his size and ended his activistly reasoned speech with the words "Dear City Town!"
So this is my proposal on the book Mountain in Spijkennis, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a 30m-euro mountain was built.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and serial homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Hora books were designated by the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small gray, which has so far been unable to offer more than post-modern walk to the area and an unusually ugly councillor, whose white facade you would rather expect for milk, is richer than modern architecture.
Above all, Spijkennies now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
Long journey to the book
First impression: a reading Eldorádo under the cover of cheese.
Through the massive mountain range, however, you will discover the real space and reading passions until you reach the topography.
On all sides the illuminated interior is bright and transparent, the floors of the hot cabron and elegant street lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, the dog and the boys and the girls playing football.
And everywhere, books, books.
"There are normally regattas with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is mostly awkward and inpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We've built a classic space configuration up your feet and space for readers we've moved out.
The interior of the Hora books is widely used: there are offices, Internet libraries, chess club, ecological center and central home appliances.
Special comfort is the black police on books that are once a wall cover, once a parapet and another abrasive stairs.
Looking at the structure and smells are strange.
They even swear to architects and construction engineers to turn their heads over unknown building materials.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the project manager of the town of Spijkenisse, on a standard issue.
And so in one fresh farm one day, we ran into a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years it has been used as the root of a millimetre of synthetic matter in glass and in fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
A thin textile will last for one, two seasons and then be mature to be thrown into a large waste.
For the library was run - for the first time in such quantity - on a four - centimeter board.
The effect of heat and pressure on the so-called Agricultural Plastic (KLP) is colored in a dark, homogeneous and burdensome material that smells a little like a new car and a little like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you'll get to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters of long journey you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figurines in flower shops.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mainly of the right humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a showcase project on ecology," Trouborst says.
It warms up and cools the ground heat.
Though the books of Hora stand under a glass lid, the sun only shines within a short period of time, even in the sunny days.
Widely glued wooden beams, which stand round to the façade, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
She'll be able to handle the rest of the full automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, a first-class IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who even designates Boekenberg as "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to open a book from his own personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, optical spaces were first to be filled so far, not fully equipped with a library that currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Wine Maas.
"I think that our invitation now has a certain relationship with every resident in the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the mirror.
MVRDV thus succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of an identity in the expert jargon.
The stories of the literature were written by the council.
Whatever young and uneducated he is.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained when deciding to adopt Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaboa is thus balancing Berlin's narrow borders of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Shabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's even supporting the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to the establishment of a free zone.
That's where NATO was finally sitting.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on serious international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that it is precisely changing its foreign policy, from the policy that has been so directed by the United States to the German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They're expected to play an independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're only settled in their role, but they're on their way to "normalr" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to take an interest in national interests and attitudes that are independent of US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, whether Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large shelter in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not the elite in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays a role.
But I don't want to attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany's relationship with the United States been damaged when, in the case of both important decisions, Germany abstained, for example, from voting on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there will be a great understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a break as it was in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even earn some respect.
This signals that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made itself clear for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always been the result of American internal policies.
I think that Obama's government is probably hiding a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the darker political situation, this attitude cannot, of course, stand public.
I don't think the differences in opinions are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to bring into line its close relations with Israel and the US on one side and with the position of the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think that's what makes this very difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little simpler if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not happening.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to move things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future and will push Europe into a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany because of its relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, always when Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The impact of the United States on European policy is now constantly declining, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum.
The Germans are just gonna have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's unpleasant and it'll make them a lot more unpopular - c'est la vii!

"Protection of the Mark" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What's Armani Polo?
This conceals the name which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, he enjoys protection for as long as the actual owners of the stamps do not regret it.
And it's not even clear if the law is at home.
"For foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office who specializes in violating the rights in the Far East.
Every week, there'll be a new case on my writing desk.
A few more letters are enough for the falsifiers to sign up.
For example, from the Gucci brand, Lu-Gucci will become and instead Prada will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, perhaps manufacturers of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
The patch opens the order with the registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, one Chinese company had kept it there to protect the brand Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that also parasites in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world’s masters in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are several multi-story commercial houses where almost exclusively forks are sold.
But the patent cases are different. From the mandate of its mandates it is against the Chinese companies getting from the trademark office fully official right to use the designations that are already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That's how the women who hunt rich men are reduced.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
"It damages the trade, we have to push it away," Pattloch calls.
"The sign will clear up, the exceptional position will disappear, the damage to the image is huge."
Financial losses and court costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market, with EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the use of questionable records in the register of marks can be difficult to achieve and something is worth doing.
Control can be extended to nine years, with a different result.
Pttloch will report on cases where the court has rejected the complaint, because the name has long been a "market reality".
If the plaintiff has a bad side, he still has to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Known cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, a company that recently took over the German manufacturer of pumps to the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a symbol that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste has lost China with counterfeits from Hong Kong and Singapore who have turned the known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
However, the CCMO authorities admit that in 2010 there were shortcomings due to too little staff and space.
But last year, "the course of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to the normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objections proceedings fell by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were submitted to the CTMO, which is almost a third more than 2010.
That's a record, and that means that China's sitting behind it is running a list of new applications all over the world.
This also applies to the number of valid trademarks - they are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion juan were selected at the fees.
This simply means that each application is averaged at 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
There are a number of factors to start the dispute, as the case of Freudenberg's German family business shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
However, the Germans achieved the abolition of his illegal production of simulated car parts.
However, the falsifier secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand still.
We would remind ourselves of this because in Germany the names cannot be protected, says Hanno Wenzler, President of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CCMO also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has a right home, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight today.
We need to be careful.
Now the matter is being discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident that the matter will lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be counted. In the company's archive, they had to even look at the old records a hundred years ago to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high six-hour euro" in order to settle the dispute.
"You see what that means to us," says Wenzler.
The threat from the Far East is threatening to affect Europe too.
And that's where the simulators provide unprotected badges.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign up for Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
This business area has long been abandoned by the group, but it has been able to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wenzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise the German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "all that is worth protecting, even in China," says Wenzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
As a result, if Freudenberg in the final act of its drama is subject to the mark, then it is likely that it will have to pay the reverse licence fees on its own behalf, explains Wenzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Assault, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Congregation is tested - and in Swaziland, the orphans are delighted to have died of AIDS.
The history of the connection, which surpasses many more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's the ass: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and pancakes are looking for tats on the parquet and quickly find them.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are slowed down, Mom and each other are strained.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts his textile boots when he connects his voices with his trainy wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music session of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi is testing a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years of age, from a human genetic researcher to a homemaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each congregation voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
Unaids, a United Nations program for the eradication of AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people live worldwide infected with HIV.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 per cent of the population.
For 180 orphans who died of AIDS, in the village of Esiteni, he found Voices for Africa patronage in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
You can take over the patronage for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees children school uniforms, school uniforms and one hot meal a day in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means "storymaker" or "the one who knows".
There's no one in this room who can talk with a gas drum, just sing.
For nearly ten years, he has been practicing the congregation in this foreign soft language and sometimes brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, the village of Esiten is located in the northeastern part of the Swedish Kingdom, which depends on the ability of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty per cent is infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some of them still in simple clay or strawberries, most of them children.
More than 300 of them don't have parents anymore because they've been infected with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in a small what the wall of the whole of Sweden: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The male angina strain, which is shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not acceptable to the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland are carrying a virus of weakened immunity within themselves, and there is no reason that they die within 30 years.
This village was visited by the congregation along the way to Africa in the spring of 2005. However, Imbongi saw many children on the streets, not only missing parental care, but cleans everything: food, clothing, education.
Without an end-of-school education, there's no way in the poor country.
At first, it was still a private placement of individuals who allowed a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the congregation of the Voices for Africa, which has been taking care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, was founded almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The monkeys and the worms belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belong to the most affected group?
Syphilis and pancreas occur mainly among men having sex with men.
Robert Kocha's constitution is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilids reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are common, Chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (pulmonary), pancreas and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively small among heterosexual adults among us, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV is found in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Moreover, human papillomavir is often present among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilides infected by the Institute of Robert Kocha increased from 1697 in 2001 to more than double the number of 3698 in 2011.
The number of newly infected persons has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
It's about a dozen less than a year ago.
What are some of the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urination, swelling, abdominal pain, or chest pain.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Hazardous infections can reduce condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the origins of sexually transmitted diseases may also be partially transmitted to infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, in particular in the case of frequent contact between sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPIs and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charity gifts, and in the final order, some money is being gathered for the congregation to sing throughout Germany.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," says President Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-aware woman who can sit down.
He also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, such as some of the grandparents.
Gogo, as it's called in the tongue of old women, is the village's resistance.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were delivered to school every day in uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone go to refuge in Khanyisile, a lonely woman who pays for the company as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a school of Shirts, built two chickens and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged that many people in the village had to take a HIV test.
It's not self-evident, even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King to 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absoluteist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his restless lifestyle.
Let's guess instead of democracy.
This state's approved way of life also blames, among other things, for the spread of HIV in the past decades.
But there are also many migrant workers who have spread the virus to the ground.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
Culture is another - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchange, he travels the Imbongi Congregation once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting, confidence in the future, and self-awareness of black people who have known in the southern part of the black continent since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of the Blacks - such appreciation not only brings joy and joy, but also shed tears among many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitina, where the singers visit the children they have to patronize.
Although this village is difficult to find on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than famous.
"Go to Esitina, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is a 8733-km-air charm from here, to the ashtray singers at the Bergheimer Straße experiment, you see that the light shines here.
Messenger: NASA posted on Mercury ice
The Messenger's probe found evidence that there's ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aviation and Cosmonautics Authority (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Even though the nearest Sun is there, there is also frozen water, as it comes from three studies, which was published on Thursday by the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet that lies in a permanent shadow.
It's supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters strong.
This water came from comets or possibly asteroids that came to Mercury.
But let's not find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life get into other areas of the solar system.
probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, unobserved earthlings, are involved in investigating the depth of the universe.
From time to time, pictures will be sent to Earth, a small window to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.

One of Hubble's largest and most sharpest images: a faithful galaxy
Spiral images of galaxies become, according to their coloring, real works of art.
The collection, published by the European Southern Observer, shows several thousand light-years away the mulchni Trifid in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triclonal), because the dark thresholds of dust divide the hot heart of this star family into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonose astronomers photographed the premonition of cosmic collisions: within 400 million light years from Earth, a woman has a core of two flowing galaxies and must inevitably reach the collision.

In this clearly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only a short time after the Great War when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The remote view was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galileo, he used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, visual telescopes have been increasing - and the views that are mediating are getting deeper.
The world's largest telescope was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had an average of five meters.
There's a large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, U.S.A.
It allows you to see the universe through two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 meters.
Inside Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only mirror measures on average 10.4 meters.
The mirror Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to slow costs.
However, its average is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap way of design: the telescope is secured by a hooker at a high angle, thus limiting its mobility.
A telescope of Hobby-Eberly in Texas is also fixed in the high angle.
His peculiarity is a high increase in light flow.
This, despite the relatively small average mirror, is equal to the largest mirror view of the world.
Radiotelescopes in Arecib, Puerto Rico, search the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.

Overview of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andean.
There's a very large telescope standing here, and it honors its name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also shed light on the medium infrared spectrum.
The European very large-scale view is also planned at the ESO’s Chilean observatories.
Its main mirror is 42 meters full and is made up of almost 1000 mirrors.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of the Hawaiian Sop Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors right now, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck's remote views are part of Mauna Kea's observatories, which also look into the universe and through Subaru's and IRTTF's telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea there is to be a new huge telescope - with an average of three inches of mirrors.
Here you can admire her image.
However, Hubble's most important impressions from the universe are helping us to see Hubble's cosmic distance.
The footage of distant worlds has been providing us with since 24 April 1990.
The space telescope Kepler has been searching for extra solar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the start of the mission.
The last preparations are documented in the picture before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The space-wide view of James Webba (JWST) will be launched first in 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has an average of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies by the Great Trek.
Scientists are based on the fact that it's ice on the south of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, since the Messenger is orbiting this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that it's iced on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to go around Mercury, scientists now have confidence.

Looking for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to burn Talysh. We can call the wildebeest romantic.
The microbus count along the road with many bays along densely forested hills, streams and simple rural buildings.
It's all green and glistening, almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
However, this is the most beautiful in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is a Caucasian ethnic group of the Taliban, which is not well known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and are very old.
The final station is Lerik.
This town is haunted by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers because the road is only one-way.
The historical wealth that the land thanks to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced, however, that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Grand Prix Eurovise in May - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
He's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here's a documented life of almost eight dozen Thais from around who are hundreds of years old. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he still had a baby.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd of the Şirali Męslūmov sheep, who allegedly was 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And since the oldest man with the documents was 122 years old, the Muslim age seems to be extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
This man was supposed to be married three times and had 23 children.
So didn't Şirali Muslim in his age in a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the people flying in Central Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan, many people of high age are also living," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are very many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when matrices are missing.
Each day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Lerik are likely to experience a Bible age often.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why does he live here on the south of so many flying people?
Azerbaijani leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Taliban.
On the contrary, the director of Fatul's museum believes it lies in food.
However, the fact that just the caloric food of the Taliban, which loves meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, does not seem quite credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzayev.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young at this geographical range.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with the butter she's been struggling with.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of Mirza's sons and daughter.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical bottled "armade".
Mirza's white teeth form a perfect line and hide under the cloth a long dark blonde copy that proudly exposes her son before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"That's how I've never used shampoo," Mirzaev says.
Monthly retirement is enough
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
For the rest of my life, I haven't even bought food in a supermarket once.
Then she'll tell me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was for World War II.
But it all improved when he took over "loved father" Gejdar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that takes place around the figure of the father of the nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, does not know the boundaries of Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham.
At least old people in Azerbaijan don't have to.
Mirzayeva receives every month the pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount from which you can make good use of.
And perhaps he's right, even a long time ago, Mirzaev's kid: "Old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a big family, they're loved, cared for and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive as soon as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The deplorable demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep depravity.
The future constitution based on Sharía's law is being debated.
The Egyptian president didn't handle the five.
We have to create a transition.
"And for our success, I am responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
They're all, so far, hopelessly divided into confused opposition, because they're afraid.
Fear of "the state of God" on the Nile, issued for the grace of a powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologized that he transitionally restricted the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his mandate to "save the revolution".
However, what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor at the American University of Southern California really wants to save, is that the Egyptians don't even have a clear world.
Is the court supposed to be free of power?
234 paragraphs, which the Heads of the Constitutional Assembly with the primacy of Islamists quickly approved in 15 hours of the night marathon, are partly a source of concern.
As in previous institutions, this proposal also states that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is an interpretation and one can be afraid that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least it sheds light on the new paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in a country with a major influence on all Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it can mean that the clergy will monitor legislation, which would bring the justice to a demise.
In the draft Constitution there are many things to be interpreted
The problem is also that the civil authority of the military courts is still to be retained.
These courts served as Mubarak's governments to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, there were as many as 11,000 civilians in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, it should also protect "the rights of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is formulated on the legal side in such a way that, with this paragraph, state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In understandable words, it means nothing but censorship.
No other paragraph shall specify in writing the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the Hanobit or the killing of the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But it remains unclear what disgrace is and how it will be brought down.
There is no doubt that the wording is not "impacting people".
Is the President's cartoon or a joke on behalf of lawmakers enough in this case?
The matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal proposed by the Mursi for signature, will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" according to his own words for the purpose of human vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For a few weeks now, opposition against Islamist forces has been on the rise.
Tens of thousands of people gathered at Tahrír Square in Cairo on Friday evening and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to apply.
"The revolution has returned and we win," said Hamdín Sabbáhi, who took place in the third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, declared that the constitution's proposal belongs to "the site of history".
By means of the short news service Twitter accused the supporters of Mursi of wanting to carry out "the fight against democracy".
"If he issues a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw him down," opposition officer Jásir Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted Cháli Alí's opposition policy.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to attend a referendum, which would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood declared protests, but not in Tahrír Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Cairo University.
She was attended by many naked women and supporters of the Salafists who called out, "People demand the application of God's law."
And they called out to Mursi: 'Explain the earth!' And they said: 'The Koran is our Remembrance.'
The struggle for superiority over the symbolic capital of Tahrír, where everything began, would probably trigger a similar civil war.
Mursi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the opponents and supporters of the constitution had voiced and clearly expressed themselves.
Now is the time to let people at the election hours decide which direction the country should go.
Most are considered to be in favour of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't ever appear"
A forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, enshrines the Hafize Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-eight-year-old human rights defender and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in or before Mubarak in prison.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was beaten, convicted and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains about the "Welt am Sonntag".
The Mursi's extension of power to all three power components in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offence against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"A place for the president to strengthen civil society, actually to abolish it," he complains Sa'da.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Sa'da is also abandoned by the international community, which is following the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get him out of it.
The protestant at Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian Raffick: The Most Scenting Fish in the World?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the country's secret of success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take a couple of mature cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie for a week.
So you'll get some paralysing smell of raffica, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacy.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, a beautiful view - and in the air there is a sense of smell.
Rakfisk is a salty peach cooked in water for up to one year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it moves and starts to be cold, the Nora people here in Fagernes are starting to meet at the festival dedicated to this, as they say the best, most delicious food.
"Shrink it raw and then drink it with a glass of water," says Harvard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat little pieces of fish and drink them a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavitation rather than a raffic," Howard says.
The drink can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on a long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of very different times when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no ice creams, fish in the autumn flocked to the air-tight dishes with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of the winter, when they were well watered, they pulled out and ate - the meanings surely drowned with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norse people were forced to leave their country and look for a job, most of which they emigrated to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large amount of work, high benefits and an extensive care system.
The residents of Sweden, the old rival, who had been far richer recently than Norway, will flow to the country for work.
Raffisk is viewed as something important, irretrievable, even though the relatively fascinating part of the Norwegian past.
It belongs between the most expensive food on the market.
Even if it's all expensive, a small glass of beer or a sandwich will get you out for 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often lacking in global reports - and it seems that most people do.
The name Anderse Breivika, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with resentment.
Instead, the shooting is called "the 22nd of July."
Norsemen can hardly believe that in their peaceful land one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
According to the present wealth of Norway, one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been growing since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, who is presenting the prototype of Nordic prosperity with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes.
We're, as you say, respectful people.
Its English, as well as the English of most of the right-wing people, is completely wrong.
We don't pretend, we don't like coincidences.
Norway is very careful about its oil wealth - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money in this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading to the global financial crisis scattered money that they had not had, the Norwegians had wires in their town firmly fastened.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat raffisc," he adds with an unannounced smile.
I'm standing in the snow in front of something to eat - I'm done.
Such a bad burger is certainly something else and he's pretty happy.
But tonight's a lovely fish again.
The hotel where I live is one of many places where dinner is served and where guests choose the best or rather the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to live television transmission, where the moderator with the motel is surrounded by plates with raffic.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
It's called flattery and laughter.
A man may fall out of his chair, perhaps with an aquavit.
And maybe all those fish evaporates.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take over the office, Will Grant from BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is also in the best times, steel bans were imposed closing several key routes to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, the aim was not to prevent the arrival of workers, but to prevent the protestant from entering Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's scarf and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
Mexico led a good economic life at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderona, but the country is in the midst of a drug war, which has been estimated to have killed 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to reducing violence to the Mexican people," said President Pena Nito U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Labour Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shakes his hand with the U.S. president, President Pennette has gained political experience as governor of his country of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the human and distant state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in good faith.
The citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in the airport and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city after one of the new roads that allowed Pena Nieto to build. These roads are a huge improvement against the rough and rough roads that were here before.
Boards with its name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring a real and lasting change," says friend and political union Gabriel Olver Hernandez, state MP on behalf of President Pen Nieta, Party of the Institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was suppressed by Vicente Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, Enrique Pena Nieta is expecting a lot.
And he rejects the statement of opposition characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He's a very friendly man, very interested in the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great statesman, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that he has from his former governor many people.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the narrow streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
It is surrounded by highways in many places by the suburbs of Mexico’s capital.
And the problems in the local community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called up to help with the management of drug gangs operating in the districts, particularly violent violence against women.
In just the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in empty places next to the huge waste.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, which is much more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the killing of innocent women.
In a better case, critics of Pena Nieta say that when she was acting in the office, she failed to deal adequately with the murder of women.
And in a worse case, they charge him with blindfolding.
In the concrete house, typical of the abandoned district, Irinea Buendia shows me the photograph of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna, and suppresses the tears.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body was washed away," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of beatings on him, and there was a sudden silence.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
State authorities treated me like I was an old coward, a troublemaker, and a nun.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's so many mistakes and reminders," he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime and the new president has promised that during his office, his priorities will be priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," says PRI Olver in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about bad treatment, military prosecutor.
The military prosecutor is trying to reverse Bradley Manning's claim regarding harsh treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor tries to prove that the military Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest escape of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at a cross-examination of military Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officials during the nine months of his engagement in Quantica, Virginia, did not show any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination that took place during the hearing of the defence proposal to reject the case against Manning on account of the cruel treatment during the time of the arrest which was sufficient to punish itself was the day after Manning testified that he considered suicide in prison.
The analysis of the military investigation, arrested in June 2010, is charged with the theft of thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
On Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein passed along with Manning's form, which officials filled out after meeting Manning in Quantic prison, where he was detained in a regime with an increased threat from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards valued as "excellent" and the overall treatment of the device valued as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of maltreatment, even though officials of Manning directly asked how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems had been expressed orally and that officials who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with the commission on suicidal thoughts, which he said several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision regime for the purpose of suicide) for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards to know in custody that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy an improved quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transported to the prison at the basic maritime foothills in Quantica, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and one day he fainted for a warm moment.
He said that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was going on around the world was very appealing.
"My world just collapsed on the Arifján base, on the guy," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in small cells without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, cover, phone calls, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying was during the day against the regulations.
Manning said he always slept with the light on the outside of the whole eye.
He stated that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned on the other side of the night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges he brought in a Thursday statement concerning the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other communities in the morning.
Manning said that he was not allowed to cover his cover when counting.
On Friday's hearing, Judge Manning stated that, by order of his guards, he had determined that he had a cover which could be covered, but admitted that no one had issued him an order to deposit it.
On Thursday Manning said that last night he was forced to sleep naked because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his phone to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that that night his underwear, his phone calls and glasses were removed from his cell.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that, in the event of his conviction before the military court, whose trial is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense stated that it plans that Manning will be guilty of lower crimes and will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the essential conditions as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in accordance with the regulations concerning all detainees in custody of the maximum guard.
The charges brought against Manning include the assistance of the enemy, the illegal publication of news documents on the Internet, the transmission of information concerning national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged with all counts, he may be sentenced to life.
My crisis of Mexican-American identities
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are hungry between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico's capital, I barely broke into the dust and arrived at the immigration agenda where I faced the problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranarios" ("Cizinci").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life was called "Mexican".
It's an ethnic shortcut, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So later on, I ended up calling "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shorthand.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the word stock of the native speaker and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and set up the front line for "Extranarios."
I was thinking about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
There were common issues on the programme that are being discussed when the leaders of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is as likely that Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a European Union-like trading bloc in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he didn't provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of enemy feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to transfer half of Mexico’s territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the centuries, not minutes, the comments are everywhere.
So one minute after the U.S. representative says something critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how the Americans interfere in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will go on a war path.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about enemy feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and defeats, people the country offers, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or parent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not toward Mexico.
And even though we now live an American dream, we go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live an American dream, not a Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we know that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats and look at us as a subordinate race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is in their opinion only about failure.
If our families didn't succeed in Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And we would now not be trapped for a woolen blanket, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally travelling to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexicans don't like it.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of.
We love the emissaries of Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You'll get the best out of both countries, but you don't even have the roots in one.
In Mexico, he looks at us like Americans.
And in the United States we're considered Mexicans.
And to make the relationship even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned in my trip, want to connect with the diaspora again.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country and press on the political leader to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many enemy feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still do not like the way their family members were treated in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an unrealistic basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed indicates that every such incident is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary deals about who started it, many buildings were turned into trouble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. First, rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to have been trapped in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than ever before.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may interrupt their dying duck situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that at present there are not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the stop of the fire on November 21st lasted, the battles of this week strengthened the hurdles on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled in Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most pitiful and most populous corners of the planet, Hamas was unable to destroy Israel.
And indeed, Hamas gains influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently being controlled by its reddish rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian fraction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas can judge very well that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained greater influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas has gained strong and rich friends.
Turkey, the re-caught regional power, which was once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, joined Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Hamas's hummingbirds say that the Islamic half-month will gather around Israel, in northern Lebanon, where the party/military of Izballáh, across Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly turning towards Islam, can sit in Bashar Asad, until Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the most populous and bitter Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Husní Mubarak, a secular deputy who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the brother of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, the Israeli supporters of the hard lines come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was put back in bed in military terminology.
The Israeli anti-missile system The Iron Dome proved its price and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelites can better sleep - for a moment.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as elusive as ever. Many European countries also have Hamas vinyl since the beginning of the last cycle of violence.
And above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Even when rockets from Gaza killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel was relatively calm from suicide bombers, thanks to the wall that hit the West Bank, the main part of what might once be the Palestinian state, and the protection of Jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the beginning of the campaign on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why would we blow up those great Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their countrymen in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and knock them out when they're running their heads.
Maybe the supporters of the hard line win, but the Arab Spring can change their props.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not have Israel too in love, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defence expenditure is higher than the expenditure of all four Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
The fact that President Mursi cooperated with President Barack Obama to stop the fire is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should have a long - term view of the situation.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it creates a violation of the Palestinians' right to self-determination with the firing of a court, which one day must explode in the areas occupied by Israel - just as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Already, repression has weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographic situation is still deteriorating as the Arab population grows.
Blood spills against Gaza occurring every few years in order to suppress Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need foreign incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel will land for security.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the outside pressures at least a little more influence on the placement of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must set up to stop arms supplies in Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arab aliens must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would make for the establishment of a Palestinian state more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the UN.
President Obama also has his part to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, it seems as exciting in its entry into the process.
That's sadly short-lived.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on dirty packs of cigarettes entered into force
There are warnings for smokers and the sick part of the body on non-respect green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands.
Australian legislation on dirty packs of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and colors replaced the brand with generic olive green boxes with vivid images of sick parts of the body and the display of children and newborns who were sick as a result of their parents ’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes is the name of the marks printed in the same small font.
This is the world's deepest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by ridding them of their attractiveness.
It depends on a study that shows that if people do not start smoking at the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even in very small children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that, for example, have shown that children attach a crown in the logo to the idea of being princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a small impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation brings serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Falsifiers from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trade.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes packs from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal regarding the Australian Supreme Court laws, increased almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico had sold almost 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and was expecting new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts point out the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left for the promotion of your products, it is an on-line space for you to be where you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a research workshop in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "Average Honzou".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave himself the job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia trade significantly.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in the mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been conducting discussions with other governments that consider similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to take mandatory warning photos in 2001.
More than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have now expanded.
Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India consider laws that are more stringent.
He's got a lot of chicken in Australia.
The images have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You're just pulling out a cigarette and pulling a box back," says Victor El Hage when he buys a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack traffic in the center of Sydney, claims that the single boxes make it harder for him to balance with the gifts.
"It took me an hour to pay, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'Okay, it's over, let's close the barn'," he said and decided with his hands.
In the world of constant connection, it is not so bad to be bored
The last day of thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for another flight is quite annoying, even through the distractions of books, magazines and iPhone (not only duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are getting more and more bored.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting ways, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen today, we have no chance of being bored.
So should we support the nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'm going back to it.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that came with more leisure time.
But according to Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Levely History (History nude) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, from the first century of our yearbook.
And then there's also the question of how we define the nude.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After viewing the research literature and presenting the idea of a target group of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it".
Nausea is different from apathy because a person is not involved in anything, but she would like to be.
He says there's no force to do anything at the apatheia.
He says that the nude's core is "disturbing the process of attention associated with a bad mood and feeling of a slow running time."
Nausea can remind you a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, boring people tend to see a problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we only have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment where participants listened to a tape reading the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they could hardly notice it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or challenging task, interruption of attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "such as looking for bad parts on the factory line, the distracting music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that grinding and chewing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to spin learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor Fenske.
We've all experienced boredom ever - late my flight, crying player, especially a long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 80s developed the "Bordom Proneness Scale".
The column includes questions like: "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
With the help of these degrees, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to needing more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally not available.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers indicated that they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent indicated that they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, three percent of their parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said that he knows that "teaching is a peak time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take an absurd physical risk, play gambling, or abuse conventional substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, Professor Vodanovich said, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
"There's a way in the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy just for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him the iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn how to play or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child not only learns how to have fun, but he gains greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the nude.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are able to achieve a continuous divestment of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of having to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly understimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways of having fun when the noise turns off."
There is no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high-school student and South-East Colorado footballer, is facing a criminal charge for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding several grams of marijuana and the smoke he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in the morning he was driving a couple of friends in Lamar, on the beaches near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After finding a police officer in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for possession of drugs and equipment for the use of drugs - minor crimes for which 100 USD per fine - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the darkest weeks after the colourful vote on the legalisation of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the place than on the right.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana detention offences have already been cancelled here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding a small quantity that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative part of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and still accuse people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from the suburb of Denver, towards the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This thing is developing so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads and regulators in Washington state.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for growing, manufacturing, distribution and sale - all until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether in good or in bad, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good leader," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesperson for licensing the sale of Washington State Alcohol.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than design what might work.
"There is no real precedent for us to drive," he said.
The Washington Act, I-502, is effective on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal holding yes.
And there are closed mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to export a State directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the marketing of rope up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing licensed hemp trading than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Legal Hemp Centre, recently established research groups.
On November 21st, police chief Oates from Aurora sent his e-mails to his officials, in which he informed them that the city prosecutor would no longer report crimes for holding a small amount of marijuana to every citizen aged 21 and that the police "with immediate validity" would stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote urban laws governing drug addicts and that they would continue to bring drug dealers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorado, the temporary prosecutor Ken Buck presents a tighter view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue to complain about marijuana detention, mostly as a way to press users to seek treatment.
At present, the charge of holding 56 grams or less marijuana is facing 119 people, although many of them face another charge.
"Our office is obliged to report criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time of their arrival," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa period, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer accuses adults of holding small amounts.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to reject all ongoing arrests.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time pursuing the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the colourful volunteers have supported the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite reactions across the state revealed deep dissatisfaction between local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For periodic prosecutors it is a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the accused of marijuana detention, and local spokesperson of the National Organization for the Reform of Laws on marijuana.
"They spent so much of their lives complaining about people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first countries to turn into small quantities of marijuana into alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national drug law-enforcement testing cases.
Defenders and state authorities plan new frontiers for legalised sales and at the same time are also looking forward to instructions from the federal government, which is still planned to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will be elected.
Despite several arrests of marijuana sellers for medical purposes and of patients who use it that attracted attention, most of the federal government has left the trade with the medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going to open the door to catch a small pack of drugs, it is likely that they are opposed to the state's authorisation of regulated drug trafficking with authorised new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to the anti-drug policy of President Obama's administration.
Several colorful cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to proceed.
Before the election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana trade, although it will take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to feel in a situation where we give someone a license, and then we'll have a big federal issue of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our promise voted against this supplement.
We're looking at what the promise voted for, against what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
In their opinion, not just today's university students are being attacked.
I don't remember ever dreamt of studying at the University of Oxford.
Like my father, my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest settlement of knowledge, a modern-day-old Greek symposium that motivated two pillars of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 20th century, within two weeks of my arrival at Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed my suitcases, and met in the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up and cried.
My friends were confused.
The journal Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to the love of the students in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson said that I left because I was forced to drink out of a tight grip.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for the only reason, and in this frame of the supposed lighting it was both bigotry and barbaric: my father, who died Woodrow Wyatt, was a highly established adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it so far.
Just because the latest reports indicate that the new generation of students on the right from the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week the group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of Younger Years (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and declared not to be welcome".
They require the creation of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation has not even helped the recently mentioned BBC Two documentary series entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student political event that the Conservatives distinguished as strangers and neo-Nazis.
In the series was presented to graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) who was driving Rolls-Royce, dressed in silver clothes and had a hole in silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they are treated as "victims".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday newspaper that "Lebian influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
Twenty-one-year-old student in the history of Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is being pushed for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unfavourable", while nineteen-year-old OUCA elected president Stephanie Cherill says that in accessing members of the JCR to people on the right from Wednesday has become worse.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to good living conditions for members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I appeared in September 1986, 18 years of age and in a humiliating way.
Hate towards the Conservative side was the hottest.
About a year ago, the university voted against the award of an honorary title by former student Margaret Thatcher for the reasons of the cuts in the funding of higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also be afraid.
During the first few days of the introduction week, when the new students met with each other and with the professors, I was able to taste the chicken that was supposed to come.
I found out that not only do the professors of silence approve the adoption of conservative disciples, but they also enjoy their participation.
A policy of mining, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the Republic of South Africa has been introduced into the trees of the covered audiences.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now retired), "please transfer the first paragraph."
I've had enough of that.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake cake, was very jealous.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were moving.
I've had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your leisure time, that is, if you are not too busy with social affairs," said Professor Pitt.
I broke back into my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting by myself when I felt a slight sneezing on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who was introduced as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
Unfortunately, that's how it is.
Anyone suspected of conservativeism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Most conservative champions pretend to be laborers.
Later in the local house, I tried to pretend in vain.
I was insisting I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of philosophy, politics and economy who went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were noticing him.
I was turned upside down, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
He's beating each other, isn't he?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people like that after the harvest?
Would I have to turn into a Labourer and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years ago, they developed into a cleaner of ignorance and isolation.
The only open conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who lived in my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being the adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for his perversion and illiteracy and for his contributions to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he joined a professor at the Bilkent University of Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started traveling from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for shelter with my uninterested metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his study in Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my Communist friends always had perfect ways.
His naked eyes are suffocated.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exploited by frequent trips to London, my emotional stamina worsened.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was pressured and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of the course, when another professor of history said in total seriousness that I was "an enemy of people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was red inside, I admitted that my "parents washed my brain" and called them "old fools".
The left was only short-term.
The backbone of my Oxford career stuck my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week in Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I was screaming inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I've never come back.
You can call me a depressed weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in the educational institution.
More tragic, though, was Oxford, from which it not only took 14 conservative prime ministers, but which is also hiding to this day for an undeserved reputation of place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino's more elegant than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion design", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Nate Abascalo, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of guests to the Valentin Garavanijo exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion design", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his workshop in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signor" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honored client.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which lasts until 3 March, rescinds private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nuns, from Princess Salima Aga Chan through the Greek princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a simple cracker from the town of Vogher in northern Italy to an icon of the international "bohemic trash".
Love for the royal family is not bad.
"At least they don't beat you with cigarettes into a great blanket, as some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a great deal of fun and elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains former wife "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance rather than fame.
And yet he's a star."
Valeria Mazz presents Valentina
The designer's charisma doesn't even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
"It's been many years since we went to him for dinner after one viewer in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he saw and felt his spirit.
All the calls could make him feel important and loved," recalls the top model that started working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"It will never come out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he concludes.
Overhaul of fertility
Gravanijo's life is not a story of possession, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been converted into a special 70-metre long passage that offers an exchange of roles: the visitor changes to the model and walks the passage to observe the "obesity" of the dreams that Valentine's masterpieces have on him as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy at her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that was worn by Monica Vitti in "Night", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In the audience, the manekynek has names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentine's first is like the first love, "can't forget about him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the winter-winter collection from 1971 to 1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Nate Abascal, one of the designers.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women, because he impresses our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
"I like the colors that she uses, they make a lot of light and they give a "fibre" face.
Proportions are perfect."
Not even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina was dressed for the first time.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she wanted to be full - time and have an opportunity to dress one of his evening dress...
She finally arrived at the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentina for the occasion of a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was the red dress that had dress with bells, a dazzling animal, and a coat with no arms.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is overtime," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored designers' famous dress "very carefully... because dress is not just dress, it's also a file of memories that they have in them".
"King" mode
The Golden Grave at Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding with Paul Greece in 1995.
In order to create these silky garments of ivory with all pearls, twelve types of different parts and a trailer length four and a half meters, it took four months to work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his swan).
According to the newspaper Suzy Menkes, the largest authorities of the specialized press, these dress borders the top fashion of the late 20th century, "return customers from high society".
Valentino, who has served as an elite "savoir-être" for years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest ranking in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and distinguished by the Order of Honors The legion gathers as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, calm, adjusted and perfect view," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago for gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was perfect, time left no trace on him."
When the princess says that...
World's hardest craft: cheese carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen
Four euros are spent by the Indonesian soup carriers with their lives and health, carrying 70 pounds [70 kg] of cheese down hard stone tracks.
There are people whose work is hell, and they are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by obtaining cheese from the Kawah Ijen Sop on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
As a result, it has to light up to the bottom of a crater every day, where sulphur gas is avoided from within the Earth and when it comes to air, it passes into a solid state.
After cutting large blocks of cheese, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, it refers to them on the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the upper stone tracks.
At the top of the soybean, which is about 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes before they rise at a gel rate, because they maintain balance and carefully weigh their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the trap.
They know that any collision could happen to them, as happened to one French tourist who fell off the Kawah Ijen rock years ago.
The tops in Kawah Ien make five cents for every kilo of cheese that he loads
When they are up, they cross the road around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they are tired of bringing heavy bodies to the wagon which the company of the intruder placed at something below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been weighing more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for a pound of cheese since 1960 and has never paid its employees.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because it has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of spices, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even white sugar.
"Because we usually carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each way," explains Anto, who usually completes three journeys daily.
One road lasts three hours and is eventually destroyed, but it can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it turns out to be a negligible amount of non-human effort, it's a three-way thing he'd make on the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, 15 000 rupees are paid (1.2 euros) per day and two million rupees (167) are paid in fourteen days," explains a carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a carpenter.
There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6,2 euros) per day and his work was not as hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the soup, for a serious reason, which is as convincing in Indonesia as cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Jehovah to convert her to Islam."
And he's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing and his eyes are tainted with toxic gases.
In his 27 years, Anto risked three times a day life in the soybean of Kawah Ien, whose cheese has already begun to choose his tax, although his face is protected by special masks and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are filled with toxic gases that avoid the fungus.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open up business or study Spanish or French," he promises more than permanent English.
This nice and intelligent young man who has reached a fate could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead do the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden chair with other carriers and gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the cheese at night doesn't stop fussing and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September dark.
Even through the surrounding darkness, Anto takes a walk into the crater and lights up the path of a small light that he has attached to his helmet and buys it for his own money.
Approximately 400 wearers wear a shoulder basket with a bottom crater cheese
Although the company has a high income, the demand for cheese for cost savings has not diminished, nor has it provided to carriers working on their own plants and with such effort, any equipment.
In fact, they don't even get a share of 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photographing supplement, which together with an entry of 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) they pick out nature park watchers from tourists who come to take pictures of the soup and its human mules.
"This work is for profit, not for people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will continue to work "as soon as possible", because he needs money to raise his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the bitch was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns its throat and stings in the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and catches the ups and downs in dense exhausts that come from the cane, the ups and downs are so hard that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and wound on the shoulder caused by the weight of the baskets.
The Uainik, who weighs his body on his back, can already weigh only 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of cheese from the soybean, which three trucks then weigh the steep road between the cottages to the harmony in Tamansari 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the bitch was my whole life," Unainik declares, and opens up a wide mouth where there are several teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, 30-year-old, he also earns a drop of cheese.
Time is running out, but the constant misery of one of the world's hardest crafts is surviving from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Ilyn.
Singapore looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporeans argue that they have no children, no career, no stress and no cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a husband, you're my wife and you're a wife.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertising on menthol bonbons, but - or perhaps just because of it - the video of the beginning of this year in Singapore has spread mass on YouTube.
These phrases are part of the rap that uses local "put the bug into the tube" as a smile of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to point out the problem in a funny way.
The artistic director of the Douglas Hamilton Agency says he wanted to use the influence of music to ensure that people fulfill their "civil duty".
"It's just about the Internet, so it must have been fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had to feel that it's the subject that we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a listing party.
Many of these ideas could have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible, such as making raps to solve this problem."
1.2 Children
Whoever doesn't take it too seriously is a Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs parental leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore for population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The latter exceeded the birth rate of value 2, which is considered to be the renewal rate, in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporeans actually have more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the Marriage and Family Committee of the National Population Authority, says it's because of "better education" and "wider range of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options when it comes to life's goals and priorities, it's not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and the birth of children.
While there has been a drastic effort within the framework of immigration policy to increase the influx of immigrants as a measure to prevent a decrease in the number of inhabitants, this has led to a dissatisfaction among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, unscrupulous xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration was also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's government noted its worst election result from the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem by means of quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decline in birth rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, expenditure on health and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there have also been certain unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to make so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence the real estate trade.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and have great success in the business.
However, there is a concern that these apartments can support a young lifestyle and reflect the development of large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the development company EL Developers, claims that their "boot boxes" are sold far faster than larger houses.
"They're more popular, and so they sell for days to weeks faster than houses with a bigger range.
That's why our money flows are much better."
However, they admit that the new rules lay down clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, the conversation with Singaporeis working in the financial district in the city centre indicates that they will have little effect.
"People are still in stress, homes are expensive, as well as education, so many people are lagging behind," says a young official.
"The others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons why they are being prevented from having children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, they're finally Singaporeans who have the last word about establishing a family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is about something that has a personal character or "the area of private life which every right has to protect against any violation".
What is the privacy of a person 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things that he would certainly not tell anyone in ordinary communication?
Newspaperers from elPeriodico told five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely personal" in their personal lives and as "user name and password" when it comes to social networks.
"My greatest secret would not be published," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm putting nice pictures or pictures on the FB as we play.
I'm also talking to the famous ones.
I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish scenic photos, photos of naked people or photographs of crimes, or write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter fans.
Most of them are relatives.
There is also a mother among them who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I have set up an account on Twitter so that I can express my views and write interesting articles.
I don't know if anyone answers, I'm just giving them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone suggested to him a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teen owns accounts on the hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and on the last mentioned network admits that she doesn't know 20 people from her list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them even mentioned him, nor did he want the address or phone number after him.
"If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, it would simply be removed from their account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
These guys aren't strange experiences with what they call cyberbullying today.
"Some friends on the social network have been kicked out.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't get out of the account.
"Just activated a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish pictures known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if someone cared or just wanted me.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," they say.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in the Vichov and learning field, believes that children and teenagers in social networks need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
It states that: "The Internet came up as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the games changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital home and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, which we have to teach them, while we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we ask them to know what it is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, in age when they are not yet ripe for it".
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - balanced, at a time when what you want most is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about consequences," he adds.
According to this expert, it is the most effective way to show children and teenagers what it is private, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras names some of the options: Are there things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or, "Would you like someone to publish your photo like you did a friend?"
You know what the others publish about you?
When you mark people on the photos of the festival, did you ask these people for permission?
And another: Do everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the internet just as well as outside the Internet.
Those are the same rules.
"A person is governed by respect, morals and other principles outside the Internet and should be the same on social networks," he says.
Overview
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at the first degree and an education counselor, explains that it is necessary for parents of children to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand every obscenity, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences of setting up an Internet account.
For example, as regards age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule "not to speak to strangers".
The South America Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without a Lima Declaration, which was announced and allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
The Agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also appoint the Presidential Offices, who have initially established that the document will be published after the end of the summit, have indicated that it will be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanto Humalou in a few short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the discussion, a video from the Presidential Meeting was transmitted in the press room, without a sound, with a report on "confidential session, the transmission of the sound is restricted".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by press speakers from some governments that were present, not Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was the list of participants, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who requested more information.
Later, the Peruvian president's office sent an e-mail with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was just a statement by President Humaly, not an official document that the summit closed.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (America del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and, on this occasion, neither was the originally promised Declaration from Lima published, although pressure was demanding.
On official ASPA pages it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure transmission for all journalists, but strictly restricted the supply of information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President Olanta Humala and President Chile Sebastian Piñera met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which began on Monday by hearing the defence speech by both sides to discuss the dispute that started with Lima against Santiago.
"We will break down and carry out a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are debating today at this international court," President Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," added Piñar, and greeted President Humal with handshake at the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that the decision of the International Court of Justice was taken was published after Colombia had adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its detailed view of the decisions of the International Court of Justice which had decided on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be totally wrong.
The Summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Roseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Christina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from Unasur in 2011 following the withdrawal of then President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollant Humala was entrusted with launching the early talks and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The President read a final document informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 projects between South American countries had been planned with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Member States of UNASUR will take "an important step towards a goal in the form of a South American citizen for which the residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, better access to medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against natural disaster risks".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (Latin America) does not have a winning principle, but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that improve transport links between South America's different locations, particularly rural and border areas... to make our countries better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a reading speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its surrounding areas from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to better relations with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue that the summit raised was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is universal and has good neighbourly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation at a regional meeting that he hoped that he would meet with his Nigerian opponent Daniel Ortega on Saturday to discuss with respect the judgement of the International Court of Justice regarding the dispute on the maritime border, which is disputed by the Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We discuss all the solutions, none of them are excluded, nor a contract with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will lead the negotiations as civilised and as fully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are to participate in the inauguration of the dark President Enrique Peña Nieta.
Within the framework of the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional block.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, announced on state TV Peru that Europeans were "killing themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now there are almost one government".
In this regard, he advocated a project to create a South American citizenship that is supported by the Member States of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean community, but there are still areas of return that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The President of Ecuador said, among other things, that he agreed with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) provided that the influence of the English States would be reduced and that those signatories to the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be included.
"Those who are in charge never commit to anything, and we South American sign it all.
It is hard to understand that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an attack on political asylum provided by Ecuador.
President Correa confirmed that he did not respect this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
He also criticised the Swedish judge who asked him to be interrogated in the Swedish territory for alleged sexual offence, while "his own Swedish legislation enables him to carry out inquiries by videoconferencing calls that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he's afraid that his physical and mental condition will get worse because he's locked up in a small space without the possibility of moving in a fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, on the basis of permission to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks with London have been held to resolve the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have always been discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is running a series of proceedings at various European authorities," he said.
He said, "If the Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it's all over."
And if Mr. Assange is hearing from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or through Skype, how easily this allows the legislation there and how it has already been done in other cases, this problem will be solved tomorrow."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly does not tolerate "sub-means, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the greatest enemies of free press, we are not the weak and corrupt politicians, but the bad journalists in the services of profit, pressure and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonian countries nor bourgeoisie, do not control Ecuador", and suggested that if he was re-elected, "there will continue to be changes in the right direction and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain Paraguay's veto on membership in the Unassur Union at least in its next elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and pucisism in the rule of law", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the President of Ecuador stated that he considered it "very appropriate" to negotiate with Juan Manuel Santos, his Colombian opponent, on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the period following the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which he decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess the breadth of them in order to be overcome and it was possible to move forward."
He also expressed hope that the dispute on the maritime border would be settled, which would be settled at the same trial in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it would be right for Latin America to seek international forums, if both countries undertake to take a decision, whatever the case may be."
In relation to the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be held in the third term of office, he has noted that he considers this option "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa announced that if the election loses in February 2013, she will leave public life.
"I have never been very interested in myself, but as unfair a situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same with me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I was just talking to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madur, who says that President Chávez went for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It's not about a relapse in the president's health," he explained.
The head of Ecuador today took part in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed with calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash hit me," he tells me in memory of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "relieve a little," but apparently without success.
The boy was in front of the family's secret.
He decided to take his illness on his own and start to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43th birthday.
This is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV unit patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several fights with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little chance of treatment and a greater stigma.
At that time, no director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic with him was distinguished, "because he had a sharp wound".
Back then, having AIDS was the last of the signs of death.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know and come to know about their disease when the virus caused damage to the body and sent out an immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the world's outbreak of AIDS, or at least the first documented cases, "means a great success that the length of the life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of HIV Units at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, who confirmed this information in April of this year in prestigious scientific publications.
HIV/AIDS Specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the extent to which the immune system is affected in patients diagnosed with the disease, while better at those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells for up to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can "live without problems for up to 75 years" according to these findings, the doctor explained in the interview.
It is worth noting that the average life span of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years and, in Mexico's case, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since the AIDS outbreak.
Only in the state of Jalisco died 255 people in 2011 and until this year 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people still die from the disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how we do it at the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not exhausted the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, or at a later stage of the disease."
He adds the convincing data: "9 out of ten patients are coming when a related infection is already emerging. The only thing we need to do to be able to influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those requesting it."
In its proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio who came to have tests in a private laboratory just because he did so by his friend, and even through his low age, he had already passed the AIDS disease and also suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer disease that is one of the common complications.
"Everything will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die, I'd rather get three times a week," they say, "but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy food, exercise, taking medication."
To this day, his parents know only that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but in charge, I pay attention to myself and to another person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO to motivate today within the framework of the World AIDS Day by his witnesses who are afraid.
"Let them do their tests. If they risked, so that they know first, if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they're already diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarises the password for the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Desktop condoms
Among the health programs and ordinary citizens is a major failure, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is finding information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places devoted to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, one or two were given us before, today we are given packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are teenagers.
"What do you want?" is a regular question full of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and healthcare staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not only behind the desks, but that they be found in the dolls in the public toilets, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not the support of promiscuity.
They don't even have to "pay beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González replied on the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his period.
It's not sexuality. It's best to access condoms to those who already lead a sexual life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
13 435 cases were reported (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This is the fourth place in Mexico in new and discovered cases of AIDS and 13 place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection is sexually transmitted, 6% of the blood flow is peripheral.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV because in one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Justice, which does not recognise the restructuring of Group Vitro’s debt established by the Mexican competition, is an unfortunate precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems, therefore, that the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the streets and the stars in spite of international agreements.
The adoption of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Halem at the Texas Competition Court leaves in practice a Mexican firm without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States of America to the main Mexican producer of glass with an appeal against three irregularities.
The introduction should be made to say that while the judges of this case claim that the creditors are to be governed by the Insolvency Act of the United States, the Court of First Instance of the Fifth Period with its seat in New Orleans says that the main proceedings are to be dealt with in Mexico.
First, it would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in the event of insolvency of transnational undertakings.
For this purpose, a United Nations Model Law for the Union of International Trade Law, which is designated by the Arbitrary Organization of the American Law Institute, has been established.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the branches of the internal business structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro vis-à-vis the branches is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican law.
The fact is that Vitro’s case was not the first one to accept this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agrimex and Commercial Mexican, for which the Federal Competition Institute was responsible for the intra-tropical debt.
In addition, it is true that even after the voting of the branches, believers - who opposed Vitro in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "supply funds", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent by 37.
This data shall not be taken into account by the court of appeal.
From a different perspective, Vitro is guilty of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 - in the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company González Sady will appeal for a new hearing directly at the appeal court, so that the hearing will take place for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because they initially voted only three.
If this fails, it will require, as a remedy, a review of the proceedings of the higher authorities, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is serious that the Court referred to a document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of friend curiae, in which Vitro’s proceedings are described in detail under the Competition Act, and in which it is pointed out that the company has facilitated its adherence to the agreements signed by both countries in order to confront Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which are the rules laid down for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for both debtors and creditors.
Attack on both sides: punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall assessment
A criminal notice from the Mexican Aviation Boards against the former owner of Gaston Azcárrag Andradem, who was appointed from a fraudulent proceeding, was found to be on the table for several months, and according to the team of pilots, the auction was over.
The court in charge of Carlos Diazem Chávez Morineau has just appealed to the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the achievement of justice.
According to it, the control authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this undertaking, in which it selected 198 million pesos from the F/589 Trust Bank.
The funds were probably aimed at buying the professional hotel management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is a majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Martu Covering
In the University of the Caribbean area, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of an association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge business and distribution centre with products from "land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include the lower part of the residential area for employees from 150 companies.
Previously, the Cámara Nacional de la Industriesa de Transformación (Cámara Nacional de la Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to stand against a monumental area that would partly destroy protected areas and represent the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which was not mentioned by the government and requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Fraud Trade Agreement, known in English as ACTA, has lost its relevance, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As we know, it happened so despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of viewing it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term horizon
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect them in the short term, Homex provides the market for investment certificates of 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones to offer interest payments every 28 days.
Born Competitive
The association of leading information companies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was born with a business name Competival, which will aim to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in the business is going to be over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was involved with this solo sport for more than 60 years and was processing the whole world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was before his brain death in 2008 on a wheelchair, burned in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of younger categories, player of the national basketball league BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican basketball federation.
"I stood up during my life in basketball, including a few at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general manager of the national team and the president of the federation," recalled Reyes when visiting reporters from Primer Hora at home in Bayamón, where she has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, her faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't live up to his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and reminders of his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest movement of all the guards, those who remember his behavior in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, at the same time celebrating 15 years as co-operator or team owner.
"It was my best summer, I enjoyed it the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as the owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships made in the years 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the champions - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy was debuting in BSN.
At that time, the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and then acting at the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a grown two-metre player for you.
Do you want him?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausseau's player who became a team member and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon's victory to the championship, Gauss will contribute to the next one."
The championship, when the Los Vaqueros team played Gauss, enjoyed it, but was only far away, because in 1988 he was already serving as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to do his best and take advantage of Mincy's location on the national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United States in the 1989 qualifying Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the world's championship in 1990, where we ended the quarter, but we should have been bronze not to be the Canadian judge who let us repeat the final introduction," Reyes said.
Is the world's championship team in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Panamanian Games in Cuba, when we won gold and blew up the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that broke our bronze into the world championship.
The crew had not only Mincy, Gaussé, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but there were also the young men (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 for knee injuries.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but which has been able to win the gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team of the Olympics in 1995 in the Argentine Neuquén.
With players on the list, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and Junior Player Rolando Hourruitner, who replaced the players excluded due to the crash in the Panamanian Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rica's best player?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No Puerto Rican person has reached this level of results like Piculina.
Not about his behavior in different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's work very much among young people.
What do you consider your success in the federation to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous age of national team in 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s, the BSN national team had up to 17 men in one season.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a breakdown of youth categories by region.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too much games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit of compulsory certificates and training courses for coaches, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, declared John Rosse Ewing the world's leading role, known as "J.R." in the Dallas TV series, in which he framed a man who acted impartially and was final and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as a D.R. Oil Magnet in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in the new Dallas series, died according to the official family announcement provided by the Associated Press Agency to Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon to the cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved home city of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he loved most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the moment he died at the Dana hospital," said her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, noble, fun, nice, kind and talented and I'll miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor on his liver, and Hagman was transplanted.
The year before the Dallas series was broadcast, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent man in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life will change when he meets the attractive girl Barbara Eden playing and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedies, which were sent only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
Its effect in films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was when Hangman's championship performance was in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star peak.
The CBS series on the Ewings clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about the full emotional part when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of spectator speculations around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in tax offices.
This also helped to reach the record in the follow-up.
The November 1980 part, in which the answer was revealed, was watched on average 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most popular show in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which watched 50 million viewers.
On J.R. she shot his brother-in-law Kristin (who was playing Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant, and then he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave the city, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an unsatisfied chamois with a charismatic smile: an honest businessman and an unbelieving husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
There should be, "Here's an honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday at Hagman as someone who was "great at pay and beyond".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of people in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series broadcast TNT stations a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second series have already been filmed and the sixth has just been filmed," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no announcement from Warner or from TNT station about how the series will continue.
The father of Fort Worth in Texas was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth in 1931 to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry tried to be happy on stage in New York City, and then in 1952 to 1956, he served in England for the summer.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could harm or damage someone," the Press Association agency said.
After liver transplantation, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped God - fearing patients.
"I do them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a bit unpleasant for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew it was an insurmountable bottle: The end of the Mayan "long number" calendar, which was scheduled to come on December 21st, caught many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sandy, the budget failure that some call the "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict that Israel is enthralled into, a place where Christians who are theorizing about the end of the world will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most challenging semester he'd ever been," Charme told Rutgers University students in Camden in New Jersey this week.
When you figure out what's going on in the world today, it's like 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor offering courses about "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, an expert assistant, Barry Vacker, organizes the course "Courts, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We choose why these ideas are expanding over time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, it can blow up a war.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant in history of art and anthropology were gathered to organize a course with a simple name End of the World.
"We don't connect "2012," because we always calculate with the possibility of reorganizing the course in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Even through "dangerous damage", students must study, create projects and make final tests.
On Penn State a final test will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give students any other opportunity than to work "until the evening of the expected end of the world," said Restall.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He moved into two hours," said Restall about his high-average student course, which he applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester we received an e-mail asking if there was any place else.
The students themselves ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Brigid Robinson at Rutgers University in Camden, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
And so apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thought is just a matter of comfort or of its absence.
Will Weekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which this could be learned," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no distinguished student, so Professor, he didn't say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was talking about the Maya prediction and we're going to throw it away," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at the University of Temple from West Chester.
"Mayans have never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar," said Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that reaches back several centuries, which people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The flourishing of these speculations caused the Internet.
"Other people don't think about it," he said.
This is how it happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about any course on "the end of the world", answered quickly.
"The Philippines has no part in the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years it was about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to think that December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period at which the world will end.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Several of them said they intend to go to the celebration of "the end of the world".
"I guess I'll call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of Samir Ford's communication.
