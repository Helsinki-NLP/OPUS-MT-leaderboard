That's how I've been tracking my location.
I will note that I was not limited in my movements.

The Kazans in the Russian Championship suffered four successive defeats, as well as the refugees from Cuba.
We're going to play every game, quote Mogilev's News.
Each of us, therefore, needs to consider the causes of such failures.
Further meetings are needed to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we had known, we'd probably have made it right.
But first of all, I think we need to add something like loneliness.
I think we have a problem with this.

China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the Tibetan Bill
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called "Taibah Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated by the official representative of the Office of the GOC on Thursday, Taiwan, Ma Siaoguan.
The approval of the United States Senate Committee on the International Relations of the Bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in the internal affairs of China, Ma Syaoguan noted.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China and the related issues relate to China ' s domestic affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative draft laws, and immediately stop interfering with the Taiwanese issue in order to avoid further harm to the Chinese-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwanese Gulf,” he said.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be stopped by any and no forces, Ma.
TikTok hides uncomfortable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age
China / Reuters image
The Chinese social network TikTok is subject to videocensorship, which refers to the area of Tianianmen, the independence of Tibet or the prohibited religious group of Falun Gong, says The Guardian.
The documents published show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting the foreign foreign policy of China through the annex.
Most of the violations related to China's policies are under "inflamed hatred".
In each case, TikTok places unfavourable publications in a context that is appropriate under general rules so that the social network does not look censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China is subject to a general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the area of Tianianmen or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “declaration of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also lists from the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or state actors”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Yn, Indian policies of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kin Hee, President of Indonesia, Joko Vido, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the tape and may involve blocking the user.
Not too severe violations are in the second category: such publications remain on the website but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are obsolete and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to modernization, as well as attracting independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, according to the co-founder of the "Producer Centre" Ruste Bogdanov.
"Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the "Producer Centre" bloggers agree with the members of the Socset, but the materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdan.
To ask whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered positively and said that he had seen such publications.
With Bogdanov, the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agreed: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: a shocking content cannot be explained, discriminating statements and so on.”
But under these rules, any content that does not like moderators can be underestimated by Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, only 13-year-olds may use TikTok.
Cossette administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the nerve analyzes the person and determines the age of the person, says Bogdanov.
If the nervousness decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in the territory of WeWork.
The inhabitants of Istanbul told about the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city

34 people have been injured, ten of whom are still in hospitals.
The resident of Istanbul, Melika, admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
It was in the workplace right away.
Later it got easier, I went back to business.
But I'm so ashamed now!" said the girl to the 360.
"In Istanbul there was a really strong earthquake
I can't go back so far!
But in general, I'm fine." I shared my impressions with the politician Jailan Ozgul.
The project manager of Selin noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents in mind, but she said that the city still feels a small surge of magnitude about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of connection immediately after the earthquake.
She reported that she could call her mother, but the Internet was working “well” and she was able to send a message through WhatsApp.

And I take full responsibility for what has been done.
But everybody's making mistakes.
And the club and I discussed how to deal with the situation.
I don't think anything's been exported in our relationship.

Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by the Merchant with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communication operators with information on more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which clients were contacted by various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a sub-number.
Another 218 numbers had been blocked and, in 59 cases, there was a restriction on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Department of Information Security, C.B. Artem Sichev, told us that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted by a number replacement.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a obligation in the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank, information on the increase in the number of counterfeit phone numbers has been confirmed.
As reported in Bilaina's press release, some of the information about the frauds transmitted by the CB was incorrect: a list of the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failures in the organization's work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank was planning to establish a number base for frauds, to which the liaison operator would address every challenge to check the number.
He explained that an amendment to the legislation would be required to establish such a basis.

In Crimea, a Green Alternative course was offered in NATO
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, should be engaged in good-neighbourly relations with Russia instead of joining NATO.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-Chairman of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinetz, reported.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [U.S. President] Donald Trump, who he has heard with an acidic person, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinec told reporters "RIA News".
Chegrinetz noted that Zelenski was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.

Money is more important to football.
"Barcelona" blackmails Naimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian football player, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the move to the French "Pari San German".
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be decided without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they will deny his return.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, focused on the interesting focus: according to an agreement with the Barsa, which the game signed in 2016, he had to get 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the Forvard proved to be a record for €222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Little by little, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him even more interest for the payment period.
When Naimar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a complaint.
The Blue Grants claim that the bonus was based on the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club is of the opinion that the game was worth only a quarter of €40 million and requires the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neimar and the Barsa almost agreed to return the “prodigal” game to Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the foreword remains.
And according to Sports.Ru, referring to the insulators, the club's lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not settled in a pre-trial manner, it would exclude the possibility of the return of Brazil.
Neimar himself is so eager to return that he asked for assurance that the Catholics would buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutto to take the place of Yaanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to have two seats in the Bank of Estonia's council -- in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi's council, Andres Suttu.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laara ' s proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia.

What club will take the UFO-free Paul Mammaeva
The football player Pavel Mamaev, released last week from the UDA colony, will not return to the Krasnodar Football Club.
The former half-protector of this club may soon sign a contract with the FK "Rostov" - the portal "Championat" reports.
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of Rostov and Mamayeva are now in the final stage.
It is assumed that a contract with a 31-year-old footballer will be signed for two years with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport-Express writes that the day before, Pavel Mamaev had to undergo medical examinations in Moscow's Dinomia, but the check was not due to an "unspecified situation at the club".
Krasnodar broke the contract with Mamaev last week on the agreement of the parties.
The semi-protection team has been playing for the Royal Krasnodar Club since 2014.
With the team he twice won the bronze of the Russian championship.
Mamaev used to speak for Moscow's Torpedo and CSCA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for the Russian assembly, with 15 matches.

The man with the samurai sword tried to stay in the garbage cane
The American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after being beaten by the samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute over the garbage found in the trash.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller was buried in a garbage dog outside the empty house.
This was noted by Todd Beavers on the evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black body in the dumps.
Miller saw Bivers find and he was upset.
He thought he could claim to be in the trash, because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Bevers caught up with her and ran away with her to her house.
Then Miller took the sword of the samurai that was found in the same dog and went after the opponent.
He hit Bivers around his house.
Miller grabbed his sword out of his knife and began to wave them towards the corporal predator.
Bivers told Miller that what was happening was being recorded on the video.
Seeing the video camera, Miller ran away, but he threatened to come back.
Bevers left his body in the yard and went home.
Soon thereafter, he saw that an unknown woman had entered his court and had taken her broom, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller to drive a car without rights.
He was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardston, New Jersey, the hedgehog manager attacked an unknown woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he responded to the fact that the guests at the wedding that was held at the same hotel where he was staying had not allowed him to smoke.
Mass disturbances on three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests continues, and the more fragmented it is and the more political fill is lost.
The evidence of the fact that “mass disorder” itself does not withstand verification, but without a political solution to bring this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must be a source of encouragement to society, but it will probably leave the rapists in extreme indignation, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be empty.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 C.E. (mass disorder) - Alexei Miniello was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few hours later he was fully remanded: the CCR dropped the charges.
The past had been under arrest for almost two months, and several professional communities — historians, priests, and writers — had immediately joined him.
Thereafter, there were only two indictees in mass riots (formerly 13): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajab, whom the court had previously extended his arrest until the end of December (he was also charged with the use of violence against the representative of the authorities, art. 318 C.E.).

He also added that the usual punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures for Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time, signatures were collected on the Internet on Latvia ' s accession to the Galactic Empire and on the country ' s withdrawal from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that in the case of Bartecko, a criminal case has been initiated under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, “Public appeal for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia to be undermined”.
Until then, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received half a year's imprisonment.

Russian MVD proposes to punish police abuse on the Internet
The Russian Ministry of the Interior has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect prisoners from the spread of defamatory and degrading information on the Internet.

Will Phytoestrogens and Phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
Phytoandrogen theme studied weakly.
One of the most famous is a cognac dust.
Phytoestrogens have been studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including heart disease, some types of cancer).
Famous sources of phytoestrogens are all bees (popular soybeans alone), cloud, grass seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
It is not possible to rule out possible harm from such additives.
For example, at the back of their adoption, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the presence of too many analogues outside the body.

The hydrometer called true people's notes
In Russia there are many peoples who are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre Centre, all the notes that are allegedly working were checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted in a short-term cut.
According to Russian Hydrometre Centre scientist Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will be truly beautiful, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky were to shine bright, it would rain on the next day.
The second working note is based on the observation of birds.
It's more often said about the bats if they fly low, it's usually raining.
This is explained simply by the fact that when the humidity is high, the muscles are rubbed with wings and the feathers are forced to fall to hunt for insects, TASS writes.

Pollutants have been scattered two thousand kilometres of the shoreline.
The reports on the first found oil Fridays began on the second September.

The Russians have no reason to postpone their retirement - B. Matvienko
The speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentin Matwienko, believes that the Russians do not have enough stocks to make full use of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions by personal resources in the world is fairly widespread.
The other thing is, how much time we have to put it in.
“In my view, a large part of the population now has income, from which they simply have nothing to spend on increasing their pension provision in the future,” said B. Matvienko.
According to the speaker, the Russians cannot understand the arrangements for the formation and assessment of the pension, as “the permanent changes in this area have been completely confused”.
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything in our power to improve the size of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account national realities," said Matvinko, "RIA News".
Chapter FF stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) is to develop, there must be a number of basic principles, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the State for safeguarding pension stocks.
The Ministry of Finance announced on 6 September that the draft Act on Guaranteed Pension Product (GSP) had been approved.
Among its main elements is the purely voluntary system of citizens ' accession to the system of stocks, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension stocks of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and tax deductions for citizens.

Figgy reminded me that Sony is also creating his own movie set, built just around the Spider Man.
"It happened that he was the only super-forced hero who appeared in various filmmakers.
So, while Sony continues to develop his own happy Speedy, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who was playing the Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, put out in his Instagram account a "Wolk with Wall Street" in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio yells, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash receipt from the Human Spider film, provided that both companies would pay half the cost of painting.
But it didn't set Sony up.
The news of the possible withdrawal of a beloved superhero from the cinematographic Marvel has angered many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have been working together well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue to work together has been proportional to the wishes of many fans [the Spider-Man].
We're glad we can move forward together."

The expert told me why she had to give up the tea in the packages
A group of scientists from the University of McGill, Canada, found that more than ten billion particles of microplastic matter fall into the cup when the tea is closed in five minutes.
Packed drinks can also add bottled drinks, said the National News expert on food security Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packed tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the packaging.
Drinks don't leave at the end of the season, so they can be in tea.
"Moreover, packages don't always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it would be better to refuse to use such a drink in favour of tea for dessert, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packed tea was not only in its composition, but also in its production method, micro-organisms were heating up to high temperatures, which could lead to harmful substances being removed.
"It's nice to buy clean green or black tea -- that's the least of the supplements in that drink," said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As the parliamentary newspaper was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy, Andrey Kutepov, addressed a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Max Oreskin, and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, proposing that he take a position on the initiatives of the Federation's actors to improve legislation on support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy has provided information from the regions on their business development programmes and on the legalization of self-employed people, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SMEs development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, there is insufficient communication between regions, leading to a lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes in the country as a whole by the entrepreneurial community in all regions visited by senators,” observed Andrei Kutepo.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of positive developments in regions for the legalization of self-reliance and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (available for drafting).
In addition to the profiling ministries, the data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive authorities.
Exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could provide an incentive for entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to forward the information available to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator of the Parliament newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises are being adopted and implemented in many regions.
For example, the Business Support Centre operates in the Volgograd area, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen to carry out the certification of ready-made products.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In the country of Krasnodar, the opening agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the final budget.
The Centre for Cluster Development is operating in the Orlov area.
The Amur area under the federal project “Acceleration of Entrepreneurships of Small and Medium Enterprises” provides for the possibility of subsidization of business incubators established on the basis of existing non-state quarking centres through the federal budget.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Loneliness continues to be removed from the shadow
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to better support for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangelic Region proposed replacing the term “community” with “undertaking activities”, since this “corresponds most to the content of public services to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo area, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities undertaken by self-employed citizens, including activities relating to the separation and repair of housing, tax facilities, physical training.
The Brian region considers it important to strengthen control of poor dairy producers by means of the Mercuria veterinary system.
In the Kostromian and Magadanian areas, the concept of social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship support are being assessed in the rule of law.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be development in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be development in the form of specific bills,” said Andrey Kutepov.
The airline helped passengers to avoid neighborhoods with crying children
The Japanese Airlines (JAL) air carrier has launched a new function: it is now possible to find out where the young children will be sitting.
Now they can be avoided if they want to be neighbored.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has launched a function that allows the tracking of the places where children will sit.
When choosing the seats in the living room, passengers will be able to see a picture of the head of the child on the ground, who are employed by children from eight days to two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the little ones because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use airline services have become alarmed by the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the Juzers complained that a few weeks ago, he had fled from New York to Doha, and there were three crying children immediately next to him.
Another commenter suggested introducing “travels only for adults”, expressing his willingness to pay for such overflight.
Many tourists have noted that they are now always trying to choose Japan Airlines for their movements because they see nothing pleasant about flying near a crying child in a closed space.

There are rare archived images and footage from films on the wall of the cars.

Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the "Free of All" single picket series that took place on Friday at the office of the President of the RF in the Old Square in Moscow, transmitting the correspondent "Interfax".
The picket series began on 18 September in support of Ustinov itself and has continued every day since then.

The “sanctions” to Russia fell 100 times
The Government of the RF estimated that supplies of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 000 tonnes of product were imported from the sanctions countries in the mid- 2019 period against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period as 2013, reports Interfax.
The value of the imported product decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
This is about the supply of goods that have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, imports of banned products were offset by increased imports from the CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the duration of the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for a further period from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, the decree on the destruction of the sanctions was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein joined the list from 1 January 2016 to Ukraine.
The Putin decree on the destruction of illegal “sanctions” (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the West’s anti-Russia sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “sanctional” food in any legal manner.
As sanctions were maintained in the West, the FP also extended its response measures.
However, the measure is not applicable to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, President-in-Office of the RF on the development of civil society and human rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously called the destruction of food simply immoral, and he said that this had a negative impact on human development.
Moreover, in early June, Rosusenavár made an initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for use.
Thereafter, the Human Rights Council, with President RF, gave a similar recommendation to the Government.
