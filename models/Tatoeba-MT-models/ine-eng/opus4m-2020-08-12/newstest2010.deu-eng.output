Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
US President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to take the Peace Nobel Prize here as the fourth U.S. President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a check of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will meet with his wife Michelle tomorrow in the Norwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he made a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The couple then arranged a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will reach its peak with the ceremony, at which Obama takes the prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third person who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the price is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He has strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to contribute for charity purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme then provides a banquet with the president and his wife, with the exception of the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests being present.
Obama was at the beginning of the price very low.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not deserve the price altogether.
He also repeated that it is not only the price for him, but also for all who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this is "an order to act" for him.
Natureguard is accused of oppression
The leadership police accused the president of the Civil Society of "Natural Protection Community of Leitmeritz" of repression.
In several cases, last year he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his calls he called for money from the investors for his favor, said Léitmeritz-Police-Speaker, Alena Romova.
The president of the Leitmeritz-Natural Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting container in Brünn does not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the packaging of drinks, in the south-marine towns you will find the sorting garbage container on the step and step.
And in Brünn?
There you had to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate tones.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brunn would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councilmen are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separations in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always only dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially through the number of tons of garbage for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Maternal Square opposite the hit gans.
Mr Onderka is not supposed to be angry with us, but this is too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the waste is also not a honeycomb in other parts.
That's why I don't even like to sort out the waste.
Out of bankruptcy.
It is too far for them to find out.
I don't wonder.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the festival.
But on the Konicova Street, I have not seen any colourful tones.
Luckily, I came to the right place on the road.
But the trash was almost gone.
This is still the centre of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics are likely to keep the Brunner socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockeyliga that makes us ashamed in the whole Republic instead of buying a few tons more garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-COM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Mahren.
The "Paroubek" budget has deducted the money for pensions and sickness money
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sickness and construction savings.
But also not for public debt or international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be on the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists have carried out the salary increase for some groups, they calculated that the government is also paying the money for sensitive spending, old-age pensions or for the sickness pay. "It is only a postponement of the problems in the future, mine lay," says Janota.
The loans are paying higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose where to take, the state cash is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the state enterprise, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for her children.
For the pensions or the sickness money that has disappeared from the account of 1.8 billion people don't have to be afraid of getting this money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state fund, but much more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will increase faster and, together with this, the cost and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only to reduce the minimum or to reduce the motherhood money, as the government did in its counterfactual package.
As a result of the money loss in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing in the coming year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
This is mainly about the sections acquired in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and perhaps agreed upon.
At the very least, get what is not free.
This means delaying or suspending thirty major construction works, the creation of Europe's money is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the outflow of money in Solomonish terms - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the state is the majority's owner and then the money is disposed of in the traffic fund.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never safe and it is not an infinite source.
In the previous year, 18 billion CEZ flowed into the budget.
Each year, dividends are paid for environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is filled out, and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, under EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to 5.7% of GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and for crimes or for expenses for court proceedings, even for building savings.
If the state gets back without this money, it's not safe.
It's just a lucky game.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save the money or attack the government budget reserve in the worst case.
One hundred million are also missing for the already launched two billion-dollar project "State Fund", which is intended to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans count for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in Android in less seconds.
That is exactly what the U.S. company wants to present VMware, focusing in particular on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the mobile at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can divide them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinovas Krishnamurti reported by VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
On the market it will come in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems lived at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to be available to the customer within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains cools the hotel owners
Skeelless slopes do not only care for the inhabitants of Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter periods including Christmas and Sylvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether, in our opinion, this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Whoever wants the Silvester stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his imaginations should no longer slow down with the order.
Whoever prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes first in the second place, who can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle-Hotel owners now offer mainly weekly stays for the Silvester day.
I think they'll be trying to sell these for a long time, but then they'll have to give up, and they'll have to go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter periods are always also offered by the Ingtours Travel Office in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the Director of the Travel Office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but here there are less free places.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter periods are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are cut in a week, the Christmas night will also be sold out, I think.
Inverted and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On the day of Sylvester and at Christmas we only have a few more rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for the Silvester stay is also the Omnia Hotel at the central park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we already have about 60 percent.
A little weaker is in the middle of February, but at the time when the snow comes, the interest in the stay in the Giant Mountains is certainly also increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday, it should cool off and if it falls, it should be snowing on the mountains.
But then there was to be a reheating, Jiri Jakubsky informed of the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Knowledge
It is almost comical, with what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the wisest, repeats his predecessor's strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he exposed his ambitious Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it about the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only did he use the type of speech "as in Iraq" in the text himself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own statement: "New way forward" without going mad.
Even three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq's war-torn Iraq - as "unresponsible and carastrophic decision" in its consequences.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush Strategy, based on the military recommendations, was the only possible and so successful that today's news about Iraq no longer speaks.
The call Bushs was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more appreciative starting position than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
In order to raise the troops, he was again asked by the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinating practices, strongly criticized the brazen protections in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to return to the situation for improvement.
The president took three months, but he had no better idea, and he deceived the general with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he made the commitment for another 5,000, even though he himself initially calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the semi-supply will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements will be kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their views every day.
The political institutions, although formally founded, are only building blocks behind which the patriarchal relations will continue.
The unequal interest between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "operational state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by its volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now at the brink of the explosion.
It is believed that the little soldiers who have broken up in the cry of war over the "early home" here create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date setting for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is on the wane.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Republic.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, it is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered during the time when the United States is calling for Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only piece of comfort for Barack Obama is the fact that it remains until three years until the presidential election, so there is still enough time left for him to tackle another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer get bonus bonuses in bar
The top leaders of the US Goldman Sachs won't receive any prizes this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers if they act too riskyly.
Goldman Sachs, according to the agency Reuters, is thus at the top of the efforts to connect Wall Street's bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after having sided for the first three quarters of this year almost $17 billion for premium bonuses.
In the course of this year, the total amount of bonuses will probably exceed $20 billion, despite today's action.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue since the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intended to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today have taken advantage of the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI in Stockholm. Gustaf took over the Nobel Prizes this year in the category and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among them were the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her Landsmann Jack Szostak for research in the chromosones area.
The price for chemistry has been received by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to clarify the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatein awarded the Nobel Prize for the economy received by American Elinor Ostrom and her Landsmann Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have contributed to the research in the glass fibre area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of the acquisition of the money prize.
It consists of ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price will be split among them.
According to tradition, US President Barak Obama has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the top of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight against world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the retreat. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives early Friday the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the State budget for the following year in the form it was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the subject of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by President Radim Ochvat.
On Monday, Janoto will negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on his further stay in his office.
Under the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
However, on Wednesday, Parliament voted on the left-hand side proposals for money laundering and increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The Government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, is therefore the result of a sharp internal political dispute, so that the question of the further work of the Fisher's Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring, appears.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, has practically settled the package of savings measures implemented by the Fishery Government in autumn and that, in their understanding, the State debt should end.
Klaus, who can sign the state budget law, but does not have to, said today in the debate with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem", the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a wider consensus of the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is gray and that the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Vice-President, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong challenges".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the words of Topolanek that the state deficit was greyish, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeded the $200 billion.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatable" of the world shows a lot of the country, its struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless struggle against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-nine-nine-year-old Mandela whether he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The two-and-a-half-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the box section "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he became the slave holder, a fictitious president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for his active activity at the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and was president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeatable", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film describes a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through sport, so he decides to agree with the Rugby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him in the evening and to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transferred, and I felt that I knew what you felt, he said.
For me, it is important to be another person.
Matt Damon is a member of François Pionaar, captain of the National Rugby team, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hardback world.
It was a big surprise to him when he first met a pioneer in his house.
I remember when I sounded to the Turklingel that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pionaar in my life was, 'In the film I look a lot bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the actor's status compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" and is also discussed about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was a very good story, a very well-run film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive reviews.
Dissolved mystery of light about Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
On Norway a special light effect was to be observed of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket type "Bulva" which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army will slowly become the alpine dream of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on site at the rocket test did not have a positive effect on the success of the pilots.
Bulava is usually not started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as a "racket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This was a 13th attempt. It was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage occur on the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulva" started from the nuclear-U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the takeoff from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over the north roads was actually the damaged "Bulva".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that this is a Russian missile.
This time, however, the generality has maintained itself and has claimed that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test started without any error, the management of the Ministry of Defence only holds out six out of thirteen.
The almost 50% success is therefore the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "bulava" will fly once without problems and even ten hypersonic atomic heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the Cska Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself at 51 years of age in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic player and Stanley Cup owner helps his team Cska Moscow in the emergency, and is probably already taking part in the Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his 40-year career in 1998, is currently President of the Cska.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern a game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morals of other players, a fellow player led Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stormmer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford with fifty years and was able to award 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the most famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union's dress he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and also won in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union on the abolition of all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime, the trade union announced the strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speakers of the Hyundai Automotive Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two work stories would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work Saturday.
It is also received by the staff in the wake of Saturday's story of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed hours.
Either they can pay the overtime premium or they can take a replacement leave for it on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas celebration, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees in the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overhours of the most urgent and burning point were the demands and complaints of the trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overhours for the month of December, Vaněk argued.
The car factory employees were forced to work almost every day until last week after eight hours of work.
Upon signature of the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said Wednesday that if they can agree to the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the car factory was estimated to be about 400 employees who were self-employed because of overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged scams.
On the other hand, the management considered that the employees had to spend overtime in order to meet the needs of the car.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, trade unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, in this year they demand payment of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company last November.
Up to this September, about 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured, which currently has a production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works for infected HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections that are intended to limit the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicines.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient may be able to prolong his or her life and prevent the growth of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Imperfect suppression of the virus increase has also led to the development of resistance, which is no longer effective in terms of drug effectiveness.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with the virus resistance.
You have shown that the substances known as metallurgy are active on the protein responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
The metals are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus multiplication in a way other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists are able to develop new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalcarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature viral particles would occur.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the growth of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe the whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effects of these series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including their persistent (resistant) variants, which were obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarbons on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the medicinal products used clinically, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metalocarbons interesting links for further research on the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Budget dispute. ODS went off on a fisherman who was fighting
The president of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the following year as "gray" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS was referred to by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is likely time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the growing deficit or whether he is staying in the office with the help of the parliamentary links.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, however, with Linkpartie amendments of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to the fact that it covers the budgetary deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a reserve of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's wishes, because the revised budget is also just a less bad version of the budget.
Disappointment and insensibility
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota has talked about his disappointment and a sense of insensibility, and Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janoto had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota has signed up for Monday after the Prime Minister's government business.
He indicated that he was planning his next stay in the office.
This is why he is disappointed in the budget's negotiation.
To the extent that fishermen speak for the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or service laws.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in a position to be elected to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if a fisherman decides to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he is based on the majority left in Parliament at the moment".
Then he could not possibly count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is what is going to happen, then I will deal with it, Minister of Defence Martin Bartak said to the journalists in Parliament, nominated by the citizens' democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council in the afternoon to Brussels.
The ODS withdrew at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister specifically asked the citizens' MEPs to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be children, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not repressed in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be particularly positive for the Bolsheviking of Parliament and the destruction of everything, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new roadmap of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will drive at about the same price.
The Czech Railway terminates or restricts from 13 December some less-charged high-speed and local trains, while other connections are reinforced.
The total volume of traffic is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fares are not changed.
For example, several connection options to the capital are available to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, which uses the train type Pendolino for this route.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains are also driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (King’s Grace), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can be happy with an increase.
Two night tours will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains will be reduced on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem must now move.
This is the 15th route of the Esko pre-shipment system, the opening of which is possible thanks to rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end at the Prague-Main Train Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive for two hours.
With the pendolino, the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's bill for regional rail: increase by 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway will receive to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year of four billion krons, just as this year. Local trains provide the districts, in total, they will pay eight billion krons for it in the next year, with the state being awarded three billion.
This year the regional trains are worth 200 million Czech crowns.
For local trains and high-speed trains, the railway has again concluded a ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, which is why it may not have been involved in the price increase in the large majority of the driving licences.
There are only one day's network drive CD Net and cheap internet drive eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the running piece until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
More than 50 people were found to be released from the Philippines.
Today, in the south of the Philippines, there are 75 people, including some basic students and their teachers.
This was indicated by the Agency AFP, which initially informed only about 65 kidnapped persons.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was introduced in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 million reportedly used hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militants belong to the New Volks Army (NPA), this is the weaponry of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that called for raids between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was suspended due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23rd, which was associated with the election to the governorate, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao Muslim separatists are also active.
However, on Tuesday, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government were resumed.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwoods, comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been won by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pionaar.
With the film's film start, reactions from critics as well as the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 together with the Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time in which preparations for the World Championship are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media are alarming the world public with alarming news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to remember Mandela's personality and message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated "In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portraits the South African human rights prosecutor within his first presidential period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman has been trying to bring together two racial and day-to-day isolated groups of people and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also taking part in his role in the South African National Rugby at the World Cup, which was then won by South Africa.
For entering the race in the dress, which is almost as holy as in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may have brought people back together as a single people, led by the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, it will only show.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, for example in a recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
Burn transformers for several 10 million kroner in the Louny area
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of Ceps in the switch system at the municipality of Vyskov in Louny area.
According to the speaker of the district firearm Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire with a mixture of water foam and special solvents is wiped out.
The reason was a technical defect, a transformer internal shortcut.
No one was injured, the Havaria was in danger, according to the company spokesperson Pavla Mandatova, not the management system's security operation.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, and the damage will only be refined after the fire.
The damaged transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing like this has happened in Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The electricity supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the CEZ for North Bohemian, Sona Holingerova, because of the fire of the trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a sole operator of the management system, which operates electricity lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbished and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers with which the electrical energy is transferred to distribution system and pipeline with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura is raising a criminal record for insulting three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, today is raising a criminal record for insulting three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Mahren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tessarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interview in the radio newspaper.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the Russians, in which we have submitted the offer only to the extent that it was agreed upon with them.
They claimed that we are cheaper than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway which were completed last week.
So there's nothing left for us to resist.
Because of this embarrassment of the Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all regions that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the fine for the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I take it that even in this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Last week, Jancura reported that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which would point to the detrimental step of the district.
He told the Radio Journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year's.
He specified that he would run the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign initiated Jancura after the districts had agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the order of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura also threatened a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't deny that we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, and I know who his name is, I'm not saying, Jancura told the Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcals free of charge and free of charge
Vaccination against pneumococcals changes the habit from January.
It should be the first for families free of charge and free of charge.
But now votes are reported to be more effective for the mandatory immunization.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The medical institute is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that are required to pay health insurance.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccine
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born on and after 2 August last year.
The condition is that they have not yet received the vaccine.
Those who have already started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further reinitiation vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth months of the child’s life.
Already last year, a quarter of families immunized their children against pneumococcals.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spends between 300,000 and 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccines of children.
The mandatory injection was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause moderate torso, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children under the age of 10.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory immunisation of children against pneumococcals was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be a future obligation.
From January this is to be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the mandatory immunization would be better.
Its association has been working long-term for the Pneumococcal immunization.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very happy that we had a voluntary vaccine.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do this at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point we do not consider it at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccine has its benefits, the doctors claimed.
The president of the specialist society of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccine has its benefits.
If all children were vaccinated, then you could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been launched as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to inject their infants against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal diseases is also groundbreaking that it is paid as the first area vaccination of the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend money on prevention to save them for further treatment, says Cabrnochova.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern for the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors will then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that insurance could "make money out of sickness insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken with trailers when inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It means that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a Bagger to get into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
The AP quoted an anonymous police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior was opposed to granting any permission.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops, which have been announced in the preliminary report, against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to "stretch" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by exploding the decisions until after the election.
The chancellor is also accused of targeting low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5-percent increase in social security and a 1-percent cut-off limit on public pay contracts for 2011.
Social security concerns
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low-gloss receivers are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of emerging "problems".
The increase in social insurance - at about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has aggravated the private sector, which says that it is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase that is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year will affect about 10 million workers.
FRAMEWORK OF THE PROVISIONAL REPORT
Increase of social insurance by more than 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 % increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax credits for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government interest rates by 2,5 %
According to estimates of the office, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer at £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer at £190, while a person with £100,000 will be richer at £110.
The ministers said their target of deficit recovery by 2013 meant "hard decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would fall to 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the projected tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot rock" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit recovery and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the volume of re-indebtedness and the rate of deficit payment – have been questioned after the Chancellor has been forced to revise earlier figures.
In his opinion, the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the fall by 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt of 3 billion would be higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the Labour debt crisis said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers had failed to present a credible plan to repay this and to press "synically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They didn't matter what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be kept away from future cuts, other than in the proposals of the conservatives, which see deficit recovery faster and more rapidly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment in some disability rates next April - would expose the treasurer to the rejection of the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not reported any state details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Research said that the numbers of the treasurer would mean strong coverage in many areas, possibly in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only moves the pain later," said his manager Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's business audit firm.
"This was only the high pre-pre-trial report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Detentions of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens due to the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, and the US message in Pakistan was shared by the BBC.
The FBI said it was being investigated whether the same men were reported missing in the last month in the United States of Virginia.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said they were also looking for information about men.
Three of them are of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the prosecutions that will be brought to them and under what circumstances they will be detained," said the speaker, Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said that the Authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay, if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States "must work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing from their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Condemns Misuse in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the last 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran's earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and arranged the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old IT student Ibrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They beat me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a wrong confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty shared with him.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the concerns about the election and reactions of the government, but thus Amnesty, the mandates and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a sign in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the hangs, but it was also quite amazing.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine down.
He added, "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were awarded for the best works of art or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on mining and concerns about the alleged Islamisation of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headphones" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a question that divided and occupied the country over the next half decades and its effects are still to be seen today.
Above all, the newest book offers a wider and more versatile spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions, now offering the 5-6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Free Space".
He is a good listener, he gives back debates between teachers and students on the issues they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a councilhouse (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a zinc-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanity matters, he claims, which constitute daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly united with their Salafi opponents – prosecutors of the Purist Sunni Muslim that is in contact with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a donation and acquisition on both sides.
He is questioning the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who are so passionate about the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
It indicates that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, for their part, had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He rather recognizes a "shrinking up the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet."
The Most Trustless View of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice she marks melts with alarming speed and takes life with her, which can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have taken place in the newly opened water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their sewer water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the North, the ice bear.
Moved in the complicated history and politics of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves at hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a braver 14-year-old Fännrich to the lake, who fought only with the rifle of his Musketeer, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in a show.
Even today, zoos still typically own a millionth of the life area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore was completely green by the algae that grew in the tall hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the siege continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motorbike-run inuit use powerful storm guns to get their prey to the road.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations will remain the longest ice.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packed insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of change properly.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries revealed for the first time the confusion of the package.
In the Cold War, submarines measure the movers of the submarine.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by fearless people camping outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater islands, which are compressed when frozen.
But, beginning from the bear on the ice to the microscopically small wonders in the ice, all are threatened by the passing of the summer voyage, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infangers were among the 6,000 who landed in the Arlington border
The topless De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single crane on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Fantasists who took the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate the graves, the day was a Tribute to the men and women in whose steps they entered.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay borders on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, continue in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other countries.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crosses on the graves at the Arlington Freedhof, in the areas of the Pentagon, at the graves of the Fayetteville National Airport in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial airport for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the border.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is his way of returning some of the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution that we civilians can make to support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in warm clothing, the volunteers also walked over the extended lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples held their hand while carrying the fresh jaws to the gray graves.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is near and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 dollars to decorate this section, but the darker mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read the names engraved in stone, while others turned to small black and white slots, which were stuck in the humid sludge for those whose graves had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
It is 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Fraternity Sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. Government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consul officials of the US interest in Havana try to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special indictments have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of "dangerment".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government-friendly graffiti and statements are seen as serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to avoid prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest message was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will benefit from concrete steps taken by the Cuban government in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
Since this year, the Cuban government has allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone, which is used literally to send text messages as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government places, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman of the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reflection on Raul Castro's office as a leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, sentenced and arrested very often within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Cover Pakistani Government Representatives Plan to Send Men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this case could help discover an extensive network of terrorist applicants who would search the Internet for radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had made them discover because he had submitted comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al-Qaida leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unwarranted mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covered operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not at all discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to gain access to Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal prosecution authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of the highest urgency to submit human assets within Al Kaida.
The employers of the organization act as sponsors who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and who could be spies.
American power recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their advertising value, they are also seen as an intimidating attraction to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, as the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?," Kohlmann said.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are demanding climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more climate-protection action from traders at the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosives near some government buildings in the city.
One day, when the UN-funded climate negotiations little happened, thousands of activists migrated with transparents through the city, on which they stood in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars join the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christianesen, who said that travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with because of the already tangible effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to carry on the word and appeal to the world leader to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must now be done and there is no way around.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying bags.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to an observer who did not want to be mentioned, since he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing burned several explosives near the Copenhagen Main Channel, where several ministries are nearby.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started out as light trucks, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate trader.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he referred to English: "This is something I was not aware of".
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disrupting the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show hard-core race air
Last week, the certificates of mathematical performance were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country's schools, which produce the highest standards, the evidence shows that in the past two years, the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress than the cities that included Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) is the tough performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white quads from Washington D.C. has increased from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance climate actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American octopuses remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap between the white and black squares in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that have reached the children of both groups has grown in this time period, the difference with now has barely decreased by 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were promoted to the majority of white students, who are also powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a useful group that enters Washington D.C. for education equality.
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Washington City Council Democratic Member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs I respect.
But what scares me is that we are not nearly wasting the time and energy that we should be using for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which did not master the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that takes the lead from the kindergarten to the sixth class of games and life-sight experiences, was brought to Washington under the former Head of School Inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of students who are below the note level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and thus continue to make available the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating the city test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The aim could be to bring about political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
Of course, as with other city school inspectors, the point is that she is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we establish a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closure of the performance climate is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to about 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey said, who came to an agreement last year with his teachers' union over 185 days per year, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and blinks a moment when looking at the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green grass.
Gracielas parents have barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was sheltered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the other octacles of the group who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38,690 per year, was more of a fearsome visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit the children on their three-day tour, and now they have taken full note of the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of hispano-Americans terminates the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role among the country's workers.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and a sense of success in their home.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of confidence in American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you consider poor income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a high-speed switch - and makes more than $300 million a year available for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 treaties concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been hampered by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has attracted the discounts.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly seated representatives of the U.S. oil multi in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq finally opened its doors and instead of US companies, Asian and European have opened the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will long be no further offers in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to have been avoided by American oil companies, analysts said, to engage more strongly in Iraq, which holds the world's third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
In some cases US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, had significantly lower wage costs and took more risks because they did not have to pay their shareholders.
Exxon mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been on the side of technical advice in recent years.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said oil minister Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the greatest of the world's economies and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its partners and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies selected for the award of the contract issued tenders which were then compared to the fee per barrel oil which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
A top deployment planner for Al Kaida was killed this week in an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border in Afghanistan, as reported representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were supposed to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, which hit their vehicle on Tuesday near Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless stem belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of the Pakistani civil service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran into the scene and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism claimed that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, leading terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the bold nature of US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as a given one also includes planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had risen quickly in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained better connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not at all reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who had been killed since September when a similar attack on Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has fallen from an average of six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN envoys in Kabul to retreat
The leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, ending a stormy period of office, which was driven by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
One departure is when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which should start in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian assistance to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not undermine his office, but only one agreement reached in March 2008 with his family to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now proceed to ensure that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he's getting better at looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives said that he had taken into account the Swedish-Italian stafan di Mistura, who had recently conducted the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously conducted UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had charged him in September with preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all the charges, but he also said that Galbraith's charges - which were fired - "have undoubtedly added damage to the mission, because there was already a great deal of skepticism in relation to international interference in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the UN leadership to allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who contributed to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the Circumstances of UN recruitment regimes had undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules have been so designed that since May, he said, I could only set up one person.
This is a disaster and must not go on like this.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be suspended "significant additional sanctions" over Iran because he has not participated in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and took the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there is no good choice, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lies on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is unpredictable to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also concern the average Iranians.
He said that "a package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected by nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer tribulation" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House speaker, Robert Gibbs, the US government joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must rely on "believing" consequences if it does not comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In its discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to restrict its nuclear programme and reject a substantial part of its stockpiled uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US Government has urged this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran has seemed to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have never done in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31st December as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those once called 'depressive sanctions' by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated allegations" on Thursday by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they were ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the vast Kurdish region of Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to reduce the potential of conflict to prevent delays in US plans from lowering US troops by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to destroy Kurdish concern over the upcoming withdrawal. US representative Gates quoted Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government as saying: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that told them that "Mother earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as a government official in Shanghai, who, by the low birth rate and the older population, suddenly began to change this summer, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, Wang, 31, said a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, retarded single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when this policy came into force, the UN said.
Division for Population Questions, while the number of population groups aged 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated people, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older almost 22 per cent of the reported residents of Shanghai were outlawed, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples in the creative age of babies need to "help reduce the proportion of older people and alleviate the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
In the Constitution of the country, anchored in 1978, China's one-child policy should perhaps be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy must face enormous financial penalties -- up to their three-fold annual levels in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical claim of natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to drive out.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Institute for Population Research, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a single child partner.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July to start an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
The posters, which taught families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who comes in question for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to find couples at home and cross information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Dissatisfied reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the external areas of Shanghai said that there is a delay in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications are still available per month.
disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Family Planning Committee of the municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want children anymore.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legal.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a slight health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West consider one-child policy false as a question of human rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we're being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their disagreements.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to know that everyone has taken care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we don't really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For middle-aged parents with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and for this you have to be selfish.
The age group of today 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes enormous demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-supported climate conference -- which has so far been marked by wild possums and mutual debt -- has again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which for the next 40 years marks an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, while industrial nations must bear the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas management has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiations that is starting in time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive next week in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specific UN working group for this purpose, extends beyond the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can overcome global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large-scale countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policy makers would be involved in.
The process will provide great flexibility, says John Coequiyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has referred to as "the whole".
It shows the basis for a possible agreement whereby industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its assurance over the next three years to provide $3.6 billion per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
On Friday, however, he brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The US climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger threshold countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is leading a tougher line with China than the Bush government's representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger thresholds and taking action, so stars, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by those outside.
Star delivered his opinion an hour after Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that it was either "reasonable" or that it was "most irresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States of China would not help financially to master global warming.
As the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake, break lines have been established both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle is also related to the saving of individual economies, as well as to the saving of the planet, while China and the United States are committed to taking more courageous action because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for those who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone beyond this, to resort more aggressively to bringing the countries with a very high greenhouse gas tax into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game in which a new economic leadership will develop, says Ulate, who also acts as regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the talks would best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft of the agreement early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensives of the small island states "are exerting political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and are demanding measures from the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrive to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, are disembarking their aircraft and heading through the streets of the Bella Centre for Meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cover claims that will be negotiated next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into the convention center every day and perform night shows, where they make fun of the countries that betray and sell themselves, and drafts of contracts are handed over by hand instead of by e-mail -- are already a challenge.
The intensity is only built on: Almost all important ministers are now here and will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen from Wednesday.
We come to Oberliga," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the feeling of Monday new
On Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an entry that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras and lay 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then be on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to a faster, reliable international rail network and connect the large areas of the Mediterranean, northern and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the shift from aircraft and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic on the streets.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network could still draw the brakes for inevitable planning battles and concerns about environmental damage.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line to connect London with the West Midlands will be run with a five-metre playing area in urban areas and in places where environmental impacts are at stake.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-west leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped line guide, with a single high-speed line leading to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a turn west of the Pennins would lead to Manchester and Scotland, and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first partial route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today over an hour.
The drafts offer the train the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would mean, again, that there would be a need in London for a final station on which 20,000 passengers could be delivered per hour.
In view of the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be built to withstand the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains had to change from high-speed lines to existing railway lines in the north of Birmingham, thus continuing the travel time between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is a crucial turning point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the train, a guide for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers arrive for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading under-house member of the Conservatives, has taken into account thousands of pounds per year for the costs of an Orangery, which he could build in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that under-house members had to live "from lesser ratios", has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to be able to build an oak workshop at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to take into account the additional interest income to the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The members of the Home have approved the applications at that time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Leg, who conducts a review of the expenses of the Members of the Home. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not yet cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the household, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a publishing checkpoint of the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked, during a recent examination of his previous mortgage agreements, to take account of the increase in borrowing by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released him last month following an examination of his expenditure from the infringement of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds per month from the last year by March (1,500 euros) in return for mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which is close to the total increase in the financing of the raise of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stageless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to apply for 1,250 pounds (EUR 1,400) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the sub-house after a Undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the edition scandal that members would live "from lesser ratios".
"In essence, it means when you work for the state, that you have to live by lesser ratios and how S*****e is treated."
He said, “I have given my money to my garden, and I demand it from it—a little from it—just as it should be.
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The Parliament member, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil trader, was attacked for his expenses for the first time in May when it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he concluded with the Fees Office that this could be viewed as "an excessive demand".
As a protest in Duncan's race, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds over three years (EUR 4,500).
When asked last night about the higher mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Law to the increase."
He added: "There is no debate on deviations and overlaps or a deviation from the rules or similar.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be even cleaner and clearer."
Comes all your believers to admire Brighton's beach cottage advent calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest huts every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free sparkling wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Howe, is an honorary spiritualist of the Chichester diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and celebrate.
The idea of the beach holiday calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and lively place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Ten thousand people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday and in Copenhagen to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands of organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force by 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what these demonstrations show is that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, had broken windows with plaster stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-anxiety policemen attacked immediately and without regard.
The police have reported that, according to your estimate, between 600 and 700 people were arrested mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitters, who had already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has strongly criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still detained on Saturday evening in the streets", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in the seating position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Centre, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the expected speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators are affected by buses and trains from large European cities, but also by many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first tour in Copenhagen in the morning, as you are following the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue seasons" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a recovery of ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say we have time, Angelique Kidjo said, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, where you can walk, as never before in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the Globalisation Critics has approached the environmental organisations.
The European MEP José Bové, the shape of the Globalisation Critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific space, where there are many islands, which are particularly endangered by the warming, has given the start fire to the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and had heard Bandanas, in which you famous the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, some hundreds of demonstrators have taken place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva some people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia chose its president, Georgia complained that it was a "string" here.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, which took place a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as its own, Tbilisi complained about the "strange".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of the South-Ossetian territory, another Georgian sessionist area recognised by Russia.
The polls closed at 5:00 GMT.
The polling took place about 58% hours before the polling station was closed, according to the Abkhazia electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the former President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, said that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceive it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After having separated himself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who chose to go to a polling place in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large paintings on which can be seen by the Russian president and the government chief Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, district chief Beslan Archba has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small feast to acknowledge the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazian autonomy.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements that were reached with Moscow last year, as those in Abkhazia Russia left behind the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Inter fall in Copenhagen
Ten thousand people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time, have arrested about 700 people, at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, have demonstrated in the afternoon in the Danish capital, who have received delegates from 193 countries from 193 countries in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the center and have not tried to interfere.
A stage was set up to welcome the expected speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with back stones and hammers began to hit the discs, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-anxious policemen have immediately attacked you and attacked you without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these extremely violent splitters, who have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered an injury from a patchstone in the child during the incidents in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles were burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in the grip," said police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who traveled by train or by their own vehicle from German capitals, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the blue raincoat, formed themselves in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go on the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition from the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more : we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that flood, there are streams of water that can run through, which has never been the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalisationists has approached environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalisation Critic José Bové said against AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organisation Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christiansen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turned to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has triggered demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the street, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the "Netz der 350", several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the fields of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lyceans.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel stated in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Sunday" that the subjects' geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the high schools, even though they are not necessarily taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have all four hours of the week and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this beauty must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientist," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who felt about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal at technical high school."
On Saturday, an ICOP survey published in the Humanities revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of deleting compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also lack this project, as well as the left and some representatives of rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question about a restriction on the philosophy of Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they considered to be the victim of after the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister indicated that they were subject to an appropriate examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination in which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they conduct practice during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Superiore"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen summit : this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" had to face at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday.
As one AFP journalist observed, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conferences, at which experts every 15 minutes turn to the public with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
"Among the experts, the twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he said.
"Climate heating can be talked about for hours. However, the core objectives can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely only with the help of film.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience would appreciate that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school side from 15 December.
The next Ernest Day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, planned actions
On Friday, the unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes for which payment was suspended for budgetary reasons were transferred before the Christmas Day.
The 2nd Chamber of Prisoners ("FO Penitentiaire") called on the employees who had no service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday before the Criminal Service to pay attention to "the theft of what is behind them".
The 3rd CGT Penitentiaire (CGT) called for "to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overhours, nighttime and Sunday and holidays in December is marked as "disgusting and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penal Service and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime was high in 2009 and not all were expected in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As announced by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing payment in the coming month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep and modernise our criminal enforcement system functional," the Minister of Justice explains in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the criminal detention facility to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime attacks, does not happen again in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore lower, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary pressures" have to be met.
"It is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO trade union in Marseille feels and announces to boycott "all assemblies and calls" until new directions.
"The staff is not going to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours from October are still not paid in December. This is also true for their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes Auvergne also threatens.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us without more staff being set up, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," said the CGT Trade Union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says UFAP Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama is the view that he distributes Christmas gifts always better than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend the first night with his family in the White House with his family, has announced to TV teacher Oprah Winfrey that he is always sharing better gifts than he is getting himself.
At a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening over the channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holiday in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama turned down her husband's claims about the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful last year," she denied the president.
"So please," he slyly complained to her and pointed out to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an uncompromising atmosphere with the famous TV moderator Barack Obama had so much support during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as children.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he had very rarely seen, had brought with him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas night and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"Before much later in my life, I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operationed, RTL confirmed that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-opened on Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found "damaged by the operation of a tape recorder", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, so his production company in Paris, which added that these damages had required a new operation.
However, the singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and reported that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, however, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 hours had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL was added.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "comes from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker was operated at Parc Monceau's international clinic due to a tape incident.
The surgery planned over several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments against RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was against RTL on Thursday to think that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured you that you need "no worries" to make the rock musician, since he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was a mistake to put himself on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is blocked".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laettia, the singer's wife, and he was not particularly concerned about this.
However, the concern for the singer’s health has been growing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later it was generally surprising that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer OP", which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on in detail. Fans and journalists have not come to the conclusion that the singer on stage had a struggle to move.
Only in mid-November did the people surrounding him have to demente a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short train: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m Freistil, at the Euro-2009 short train in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane withdrawals were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record stream was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Surprise over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in the swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec., in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane trailers that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations ended their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, at the end.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he completed his second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
United States : Countdown at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars estimated
A Roman tombstone, calculated by French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday over its value, according to the artist Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century to Christ and has always been valued with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of dionysus are represented in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the sale of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far offered to do," says Sotheby's spokesperson, Dan Abernerthy, against the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was almost 300 years old in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family home, and then it dived a piece for play with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Emile Zola Heritage", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and of the fresco "Rugon-Macquart".
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been postponed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the defeated Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soils as no longer compatible, after this line had refused by the Putch government as unacceptable.
After a phone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, it seems to indicate that there is a consensus on the possibilities for carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa explained.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane operated by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of Mr. Zelayas, was returned to his place of departure.
The Potsch government wanted Mr. Zelaya to be "despite" and ask him abroad for political asylum.
The President-in-Office refused this, however, because he wished to return to Mexico as the welcomest official head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to move me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to give up," Mr Zelaya said on Thursday to Radio Globo, where he has often reported on words since the beginning of the political crisis that has taken place in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and enjoy ten years, here I have my guitar, added the defeated president who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa, under the attack of some accords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not contain a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking any country for asylum at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur Canal, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, as he had stressed, would only take place as President of the Honduras people.
The rumors of an exit by Mr. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the defeated president, who had risen to the Brazilian Embassy and had gathered around them, thereby strengthening the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putsch government.
This, according to his estimate, manifests the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was defeated on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organized by him to prepare for his re-election, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested for treason, and he will be charged with justice, according to the Putsch government.
The President of Putsch Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to release Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo, although recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street on the Rise, U.S. Trade Balance Feeds Optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high, American trade balance sheet figures testify to a price relaxation of United States shares and their partners: Dow Jones has added 0.67%, Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the figures at the closing point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 68.78 points rose to 10,405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190,06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor ́s 500 index was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various economic sectors, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are particularly focused on the figures of the American trade balance sheet, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated an increase in deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The major innovation is the increase in the overall volume of trade, particularly in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, Christopher Cornell commented from Company Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers has been "falling at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of public bonds at 10 years of age rose to 3,482 % compared to 3,432 % of the day-to-day, the profitability of the loans at 30 years of age to 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % of the night-to-night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power pipe out "Dammen in Weiss"
On Thursday, several hundred Cuban-owned partisans have beaten up the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Day of Human Rights and have also avoided another broadcast, which has temporarily caused a good dozen dissidents to be arrested.
For the forty women in Weiss, married women or close political prisoners, the government's partisans under Raul Castro were spit out on the open road, just as they were at the footpath in the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Södner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There's Fidel and Raul!" the powerful partisans scandalized the dissidents with raised fists.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "woman in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the evening before, where there has been no injury or arrest.
On the other hand, in the port district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents, who also opened the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civil policemen, a reporter of the AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, police officers have been forced to enter civilian vehicles, forced by the government's partisans to resort to violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As observers for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "woman in Weiss" has organised an unauthorized march for the "Prayer for the Release of All Political Prisoners", whose number is estimated to be around 200 dissidents, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003 from which 53 sit behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime's opponents as "Soldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
It is a rarity to see the Cuban television about the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary" reports.
Cuba, led by a Party of the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defunct rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion.
Crazy guy kills eightties with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday afternoon, at the main business time in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), a mad man with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five others.
According to the first figures of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 18-year-olds for unexplained reason in or before a pharmacy at the Boulevard Jean-Jares with two knives and this, according to police reports, was under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is said to have suffered the consequences of his injuries by a police syndicate Alliance in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacies, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triesigers, attacked and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, since, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police station.
The armed man who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police reports should be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by accident: a thirty- and a forty-year-old, with the last of the two heavy ones.
The scenario stayed in the dark at night.
He had been armed with two meat knives that he had crossed behind his back, said on site Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Union Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passersby, including young people, should have tried to bind the crazy person according to the witness reports of the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the triples with a green west.
Three young people tried to step in.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
At the Boulevard Jean-Jaires, at the height of House 61, two city policemen, including their chairman, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, such as police data.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them into the first aid facility and noticed a tearing wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-six-year-old, was injured by cutting wounds.
Finally, state police officers arrested the man who did not carry any ID papers.
Nanterre's State Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the district reference of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police (SDPJ 92) with the case statement.
The crazy guy was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been found to be judicial.
A police station does not prevent it from being delivered to a nervous facility.
According to another police source, six police officers were able to tie him to the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of surprise" such as "all spiritual confusion of this kind, in which the forces set themselves free during the march".
USA: Polanski's lawyer is calling for a re-arrangement of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to prosecute his client, who is currently in his residence in Switzerland due to a seat violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", brought serious procedural errors in the second district of California before three judges of the Court of Appeal in 1977.
I am calling for a sentence in place, Mr Hummel said before he added that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "has left a cold one running down his back".
According to him, the - now dead - judge Rittenband, before he fell into trial, discussed with a state attorney who was supposed to have told him, Roman Polanski earned a breeding house -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski: Pursued and Wanted), especially by the instigated state attorney David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells had stated that the authors of the documentary film had "refused".
If the Court of Justice refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel is asking for the conduct of a process which would enable him to provide evidence for his arguments.
The prosecution, on the other hand, repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a debate on the abolition of the assets of the accused cannot be seriously taken into account until Roman Polanski appears before the court.
The 76-year-old director was fled from the United States in 1978, even before the publication of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
The Deputy State Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who is a possibility of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
According to her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a pardon and thereby despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make their decision known – even stressed that "there are other options to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the imposition of the persecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear it by being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind the grids, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and ends without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a price in a market that was between better than expected indicators in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available when closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blickxilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain that way by the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, "which have contributed to improving the market view of the robust recovery of the economy", said Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months behind each other and far more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, compared with 73.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's Index Preview.
However, the indices have been blocked by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, so ''the sectors affected by the economic situation are pressed down," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has fallen back.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the 10-year-old savings loan increased by 3.540 % compared to 3,482 % and the 30-year-old loans rose to 4,497 % compared to 4,492 % of the day before.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday will go beyond the last curtain to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this in front of a billion television.
While this great beauty fair, held for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, has already taken five of its tickets to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut off in the course of their African stay as Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model.
This was a real waste of pleasure.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Kap Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and made every amount of experience!," said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 17 a.m. (15 a.m. Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South Africa's summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscoverment of "surprising landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, encounters with the press and Safari, the miss now concentrates on the competition.
Inderin Poja Chopra hopes to enter the steps of Priyanka Chopra, which has been elected 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as succeeding Aishwarya Rai, who has been elected in 1994 and both Bollywoodstars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizer, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates defiling in traditional ways and not forgetting, in the bathing suit.
The presentation is presented by a TV moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beautiful queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world to receive knowledge with little to exceed heart and pride, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they cost with the bike and the local kitchen.
However, quite exceptional was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, their most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise something more for this event.
I've got people I could probably never get close to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised by Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
News about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been there for a few days in the hospital.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (MEZ 21 p.m.) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would be "fastest" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a tape record incident in Paris on November 26th.
The singer was transferred to an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by doctors from Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a tape operation in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to undergo again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school event at the French high school of Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer has heavily charged neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were told he set up the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
I have heard that a trial may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "is too fast and this has been travelled with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as totally unproblem, which surprised me very much, because I had already two tape operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he became aware of RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsburg to resorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has been condemned several times because of failed operations and not to be forgotten because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medical Chamber, referred to him as "a man without scruples" who has "regular" responsibility before the Board and "everything other than recommendable" is.
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not call for bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
At any rate, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been going on since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear from the point of view that it is too short to continue the tour on January 8th (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) is energetic and calls on the New Centre Party not to use its seal anymore.
The Party Alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's party MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under the threat of a judicial prosecution, to no longer use this seal on a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to reflect on his efforts, he had received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand as the first such brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la privété industriale".
However, the business record of the UDF's friends, which was monitored by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they had not been able to make themselves available and placed a deadline for the Minister and the MP, under the threat of a judicial prosecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to them.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal ++, the Party Alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 Bureau members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You probably also believed that you have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material and on the start page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, explained the UDF's company and called on the party NC to "remove the name UDF immediately from all material and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was asked "to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal claim holders".
If you refuse this, we will bring complaints against you to enforce the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stressed that "UDF "has been a complete political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends "have taken the choice" to leave this 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement as it had already done other 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The New Centre has therefore no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française) according to the signatory.
They continue to recall that the last UDF 2007 Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business centre to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "was he at the time he applied for the brand name, no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way from the lack of the interpretation of the acronym UDF in order to carry it out for himself.
Furthermore, you should be aware that this indifference is on the best way to turn into a crime, and the strategy of the NC is ironic: "It appears to us in politics as well as in life that it would be more desirable to name ourselves instead of trying to come out of the anonymity by using a fraudulent name on which one has no legal claims."
Business Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether he, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claimed, had used a weak moment of the eighties to absorb some of their wealth.
On 15 and 16 April 2010, the 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible for exploiting weaknesses before the court, a penalty awarded with a penalty of no more than three years and a fine of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will in fact be a process in this case that is worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mothers and daughters fatten and at the same time have the tugs of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire in hand.
However, the 15th Penal Chamber also conducted a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, conducted jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's successor and principal shareholder has so far refused to undertake such an investigation, particularly not under the conditions laid down during the investigations by Nanterre's State Prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to submit a report before 10 March 2010, explaining clearly whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be subject to these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me George's Kiejman, explained after the negotiation.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Mayers, Mr Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very pleased with the Court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he has manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of using her mother's weakness for years to reduce donations of a billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
On your side, Liliane Bettencourt had always objected to being manipulated by the photographer, whom she viewed as a long-standing friend.
Although the Court had to examine the admissibility of the appeal brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the plaintiffs led the lawyers to a large family bench on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt appealed to three of his client's letters sent to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she suspected her husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre State Prosecutor's Office is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because in the last few days a court of inquiry has refused to initiate a judicial remedy against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and does not have any forearms.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Court has now decided to issue a judgment after the proceedings for the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers took place.
Manager's Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Learning?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French company, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution said: It is "values" that are added to the staff that determine the best way to hang on the consumer products of the technicians at work.
By giving the customers in the center of the company the marketing revolution has given the strategies of taking over the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian experiment products separate factors to hang the customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of the employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicide at France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the culmination of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more decisive than those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "from all the parties involved (...) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach"; it claims from the employees an action which totally contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would allow employees to put the company's concerns at the same level alongside the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal polls, as the questionnaire submitted to the Orange to its payees, encourage this revolution in relation to management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in view of a new situation, the whole thing is finally getting to the point of doing it first and foremost, what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
By intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioral theory that was recently reactivated by the U.S. "Neurosciences" and which was unscientificly widely disseminated by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to act the "Hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution that is necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any discussion or practice of the management: for the recipient, the undertaking for the company is only possible if it appears clearly to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a pre-specified doxa that allows them to estimate what it perceives of the company, which offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, companies' executives can control, predict and prevent their "social performance" and place their Human Resource Management in the right.
They thus create a fertile soil that is conducive to the smooth development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "right war" brings Obama Lob to the right
U.S. rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech on Friday night in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Prize defended the concept of "true war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had ridiculed Obama's award on October 9th praised the President's speech this time, following the example of the former Vice-Chairman candidate in the 2008 elections.
I felt as he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that she herself had brought the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war to the language of the memoirs published in her essays.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives welcomed, who acknowledged in particular the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts I have felt this speech completely and even historically, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former Member, who was seen by some as potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "Chairman of the Left", which reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not afford a prize for peace if there was no use of violence".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and editor at Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does it", he "talked like an American president", when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falke of the era Bush, described the talk on the National Review Online website as "weary, high-end and inspirational".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return to the forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacrer can simply justify the innocent, he warns.
However, the pressure on the measured left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which is still the view that the Nobel Prize was given to Obama early, described the claim itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The Oslo speech "provides a roadmap to manage international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote driver: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the provision of Christmas nights
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Union and the Tlf - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an end on Friday to an agreement that ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement launched on Wednesday after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 till the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "has added a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holiday at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase of 4 % for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9 % for the highest pay groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're just starting small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"But there will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLV president Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "hard to admit these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase of 170 euros per month is for the low and between 100 and 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "an acceptable compromise" in this regard.
The Agreement also provides for an increase of 3 % in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport undertaking in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the 13th month period and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes on employers in the amount of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to draft the revised budget for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government demands "an identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the Tlf allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies associated with this organisation and subsequently to be applied in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole state of the profession.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, insured bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Group called for a "trafficking trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to disappoint the Gans-Esser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complained.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "threats the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders on this weekend, unions not satisfied with RATP's proposals
The disturbances on line RER A, France's largest high-speed rail network for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), which continues to await strikers with their demands for payoffs.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced the passengers to move around.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the major businesses technically".
The RER A line passes through the Paris Balling Room from West to East.
The section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre and Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost no one during the poor traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human emotion on the train tracks, as the inhabitants of the island of France had adjusted to the situation.
As early as the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less than otherwise, especially due to the lack of gymnasiumists.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide care for passengers by officials and law enforcement forces, pointed out that there had been no congestion at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Skin came or drove over the Saint-Lasare railway station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers took place again, while the results of the meetings with the leaders on Friday afternoon were reviewed as "necessary".
The RER Director proposed the specific development of a protocol for RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they demand a long-term paycheck.
The CGT felt that the RATP itself put its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership was "not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled to be held on Monday for "a comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows to the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership that so far refused any discussion during the strike and drew closer to a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to line RER B after a prior announcement by Unsa and independents.
The associations are demanding a salary supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents). They also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line who have years of professional experience refer to a gross wage of EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 as well as a salary supplement of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for shift services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed by the immediate demonstrations in the Kurdish Community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the Government extremely difficult, which is trying to reach the Kurdish Community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been taking place for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kilic, the decision would have been reached unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to hold the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and parliamentary Mrs Aysel Tugluk, were excluded for the period of five years from the political scene.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than act as partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the Turkish Attorney of the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdulrahman Yalçinaya in 2007. He accused the DTP of following the "guidance" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that the PKK is "no connection", but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court functions between the Government, which is intended to oppose the Kurdish Community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to secure the support of the PKK through the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP's leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks had led to clashes with the police.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
When the demonstrators began to throw Molotow cocktails and stones, they used tear gas grenades and water pumps.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkey claimed that the court's decision would "further deepen the despair".
"Turkey can't clarify this (Kurdish, etc. editorial) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the conclusion of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It is obvious that you can take care of a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known as an attack where seven soldiers were killed in the north of Turkey three days earlier. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snow breach can come
A really cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
Especially so that his employees can test and master all vehicle technology.
At the end of the week, it could be this far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
As soon as there is a surface-covering cut in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-trains with large-scale vehicles will disappear, Brauburger explains.
These include main roads such as the New Way and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with cases such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES service begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be sprayed in maximum three hours with moisture salt, which is better held.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the trade starts".
It'll be hard if it cut only at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattered vehicles".
Only after, so that it does not continue to cut, are the transport and unlocking roads, which are also part of the Council-Beil road, in the row.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the people of the FES will make their way, points of danger and transitions.
For all bicycle routes, the FES can usually not take care of itself.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in mind, says Brauburger from 22 to 4.30 p.m.
Since it is on these fast slopes, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the current is on its way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The Paths of the Dinosaur
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-feeding dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters big animal walked on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with bicycles and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangäa supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaur, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the relationship, the expansion and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in the North of New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unparalleled for deposits from the Trias, reports Team Member Randall Irmis of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they brought together the remains of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary finding: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, usually you only find single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current opinion, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these ur dinos is most controversial.
For example, experts are discussing when the axes split into their three main development lines: the meat-fed theropists, later known as the Tyrónosaurus reg, the Velociroptor and also the birds known as the "Lang Helse" four-boned sauropods and their relatives, and the plants feeding the Ornithchia (bird-bean sacurs), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original therapist.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications of airbags, as well as the descendants of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive therapist with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had airbags and light-duty bones, it is likely that the common approach of the two groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers follow that the Ecks first appeared there.
As a result, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which were still a single mass of land on the Pangäa Supercontinent.
The fact is that the team, together with Tawa, gathered the remains of two other, not particularly closely related therapists.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrant background, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also objections freely.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His view could be distorted because in South America there were just a lot of primitive Dino fossils left, while there was hardly anything to be found on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the Reptilian strain to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, it is still formidable.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the aerosols and with many other axes.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border between the Trias and the Jura died.
History of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There might have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever at all.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Trias and since then a shadow cloud was tempted: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are the University of Cambridge, the Uni Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Professors from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University hit waves worldwide.
278 professors and students of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarity with the Protestant students at the Campus Westend.
In a declaration written in German and English, they 'disappointment' the police action imposed by the Bureau.
President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the education course to be accommodated last week because walls and works of art had been embellished.
Five students were injured.
The damage, according to the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police team".
Space is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and is linked to the content.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary speech.
The teachers demand the immediate imposition of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, it says.
Protest Authorised
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi Secretary of Youth Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the President and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but not an understanding of vandalism, according to CDU Land-Designer Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw this as SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalise the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared up.
The Left has tabled an application that calls on the Minister of the Interior to report on police action.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered as a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded place for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today the municipality is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley" with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre.
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds have contacted the Frankfurt science centre Riedberg - with the uni-institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt by planning agent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focal point will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to walk on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large companies of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the "socialist plan city" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green Town") received its name from the forested mountain landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be used high enough.
For the sponsors of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will collapse the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade into unhindered construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with rails ending in the middle of the city were then considered as transport fossils of the 19th century, which functioned like brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took enormous amount of time to turn locomotives from rear to front.
Get in, keep out of here, keep going - so let's go.
For this reason, the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station located about half the way across the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being dealt with, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have found that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and Bavarian capital to implement the deep-sea.
However, there has been no problem of entry and exit since there have been modern turnabouts with motor vehicles and motor vehicles on both sides.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now approaching.
National and municipal politicians have carried it out.
The train also carries the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project can still be justified in some ways.
There is a new city space that - you think of the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 80 years old - was attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was not the competition of the cheap pilots.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction line does not run for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also involves many other railway projects.
Good six billion euros are to be banned in Swabbish.
That's the official number.
Experts hold 10 to 15 billion for realistic purposes.
It stands to reason that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and points of stress in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the good 180 kilometers long route through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track in the time-lupent tempo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake lock.
The Rheintal route will be the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment of the airport
In Wiesbaden, the government has made it clear whether it will go against the judgement of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in the revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legalise the over 400-page VGH decision, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Landebahn in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the national government, shall not be compatible with the statutory protection of the population from night-time flying noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th whether it is against the judgement in the revision.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to abandon a review of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this is to be regarded as a "word break".
It's damn hard if you can keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir on the FDP polling logo "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the rejection of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "rights and trickery".
A precise legal review takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal resolution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
So, as they represent the opposition, the statements of his group have never been a night flight ban.
U.S. banks pay back help
The crisis-stricken U.S. Grand Banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) to a blow.
And the Citigroup also plans, after a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, to repay state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been lifted with the adoption of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of managers' bonds and the establishment of high fees.
The Bank of America had made good $19 billion of fresh money available to investors on foreign exchange loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own cash box, which was filled, among other things, by sales of parts.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday morning: the moneysprays have helped over a very difficult time.
The financial house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to get rid of its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion heavy increase in its capital, CNBC reported calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their help.
Quick Select
Then everything went faster than thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender from the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night the board wanted to vote over the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF headquarters studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender of this - officially in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in preventing ZDF's agent Markus Schächter from further harming, and this proposal should also not be passed on to the Governing Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächer, with his proposal to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, failed in the Governing Council.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a fall for cowards, a expected one.
Because the majority of the Union members of the Governing Council had signaled to the election weeks before Brender did not want to confirm his office.
The opposition to the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch was organised.
With the argument that, under Brender, the ZDF's broadcasts would have lost its share of power, he refused another term of office of the high-profile chief editor.
So until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was cast.
In the last few years, even 35 state courts have been involved in the debate, which considered the conduct of Kochs to be unconstitutional.
He didn't take advantage of it.
For Individual
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, teaching and romance.
After that, he worked in the Southwest Funk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey changed to ZDF, first to "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 Head of the ZDF Foreign Policy; then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender's election, which was still elected by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday to the journalist of the year.
Koch's counterpart to the Governing Council, the Rhine-Palestinian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF state contract in such a way that the intruder's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded the withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a smart chess game to the board by criticising the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this record of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both nominees without face loss for the Chief Editor's posts and the Board of Directors, without suspecting the appointment of a party.
In the party's mathematics, Frey is nevertheless considered to be the left-wing liberal.
Study Distorted
Success for the students: After one year of the education course, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the students' workload should be reviewed and "a realistic and representative measure" ensured.
Policies and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural standards for Bachelor and Master Studies more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different country rules.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Ministers of Culture and Uni Rectors have carried the flying word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: "Every module usually closes with only one test," it says in a 30-page paper that should partially re-regulate the admission of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the test burden", said Reinhold Grimm, president of the Accreditation Board, a "error development" should be offered a content that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "study" is to be "the crucial criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "necessary student involvement in the choice of
Events" would be avoided.
Students would have "the right to receive playrooms that enable and promote their own initiatives".
The rules should apply to the approval of new but also to the verification of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – however, which means it will take until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout the country and are subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries to "improve" so as to influence the agencies that the bulk of the substance is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In each country, universities and universities have already agreed on appropriate measures with the Ministries of the Land.
As the only country up to now, Rheinland-Pfalz said additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are primarily intended to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as inspection and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelty of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design should be more flexible and the recognition of performance certificates should be ensured at other universities and access to the Master should be facilitated.
By the end of the year, all studies in the country will be examined on their feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition had again disputed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Government of Juso University Group called for the development of education policy to be no longer "closed doors" for ministers and university directors.
At the latest, after the course of education, students should now also "interpret a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the president of the conference of high school directors (HRK), Margaret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture who discuss a joint reform paper with the HRK.
The Education and Science (GEW) trade union did not go far enough: it requires a legal claim that enables every graduate with a Bachelor degree to access a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that for today's generation of Bachelor students there will be enough master's study places tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, according to GEW CEO Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set up a significant number of teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves on the free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost uncontrollable..." says the beginning line of a poem by Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in Romania in 1951, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's bookstore before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
During a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, he arranged for a significant extraliterary view, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror of its security records".
Apparently, Söllner left a statement in which he received his cooperation as IM for the Romanian Secret Service Security in front of Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German language award in 1989.
The applications had begun as a matter of urgency, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner said, "so someone who hasn't resisted security's harassment."
The Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his unparalleled literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania is shocked by a case that exposes the origins and downs of a political system based on monitoring and observation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after this state of knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner's confession by literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He's got him in everything for him at the time "outside", says Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, however, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for security hospitals, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, as you can imagine, are being speculated, and in some cases they may also have known which name is clear behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu, and even Walter.
Unlike the very procedural view of the Stasi acts, the treatment of the security surveillance leavers is still very widespread.
A systematic clarification has been delayed and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Development of the Security Act (CNSAS) was founded in 1999, but the issue of the acts has been rather restrictive.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the acts.
The fact that the influence of former security members in Romania is still very high was demonstrated after the Nobel Prize was announced to Herta Müller, in which a former security chief from Temesvar said no more than the winner.
She's got a psychosis, and finally she's been interrogated only once.
The infamy of power here thought to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with blind debt, is a matter of inevitable importance.
Why only now? Who has been damaged? The sincere reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter is more determined by the pressure of knowledge than by guilt and shame.
To the Genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Attachment Champions League
It seemed as if an adrett-dressed outside servant came from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sportsman had distributed Goodies when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic kit of the equipment, went up to a busy C class a quarter hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive glacier was allowed to drive because of the foreign city he was still in.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself too - alcohol was not in the game, and thirsty before luck the 55-year-old was as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is going on.
Or it's just the right thing to do.
In the words of the Swiss only three days previously committed: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be confused by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "a lot more important task" is ahead of Sunday.
Then, in Mainz, it is necessary to repeat the king-class performance in the League every day.
And put all the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates through Marica (5), Tresch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Ellipsis
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hingames 16/17. + 23/24 February/plays 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the brilliant body of the Babel successor remained.
Not only in the supposed health bringer, who had given the uninsured Stuttgart profession in the short time confidence, commitment and fun play.
I went to the players and told them that they should think of their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, soul clumps Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe that under therapist Babel had no longer had any effect.
He invented a certain magic, said Babel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been considered possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break of injury due to his dynamics, progressed to the best player in the square, tried to describe the identified " phenomenon" with the verbal "fresh wind" and the way in which the new president works: "He is a man who is demanding and demanding discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
At Babel, it was evidently lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, the Sports Board warns Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs constant.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful to overestimate the victory against a weak and totally exaggerated defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 if the evil awakening had come, Khedira gave thought.
And the sports board Horst Heldt recalled that although one season goal has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months of celebration was at the events of the weekend, which were freshly relived in the form of a TV interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt counted Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had presented leadership weaknesses to the board and had decided to change the training on the pressure of pubertying fans.
Even that his free day was deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and dissatisfaction.
Lehmann's statements were "moved by pure selfishness", Heldt stepped back and announced consequences for the finale.
You'll probably be no longer friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the preparation of the dissolved training team, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastic hat.
WM-Fight in Weight
Hot Duell in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson Worldmaster Vitali Klitschko always provoked again with words and gestures.
After 12 hard rounds, however, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the Court of First Instance was delivered unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains World Cup champion in gravity.
The 38-year-old WBC won the US-American Kevin Johnson by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after its comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't fit with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, twice he had to be beaten because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meter big Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The 11 centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced before the duel the end of the Klitschko era, always withdrew from the world champion's battles, so that Klitschko could not reach his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats only rarely hit the world champion.
Meanwhile, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, which went over the full distance of 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided for some worms in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He policed Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who can't do anything right.
At the weight, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also won in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of exile, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "wBC" belt, which he had to give up without fighting.
This year, he was involved in his title protests Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight, I only got a hit and I was physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt, however, wears the British David Haye after it was able to dethrone 2,13 metres of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Apparently, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Falls
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the customer's business.
SPD and left require clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious mistake.
The minister said on the death bombing on two tanks trains of September "scientific the truth," Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD message "Daysview".
He's been lied to.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Group for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report which NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the cargo carried out, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured according to the Nato investigation report.
Green, SPD and left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express himself immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of the targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Chancellor, Federal Defence and News Service have approved this new strategy, Mr Trittin and Mr Renate Kunast requested.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not influence the concrete use of the Federal Defence in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts also arose regarding the representation of the Ministry on the grounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and fully informed of the background of the tank cluster attack.
Officially it had been said that they would have denied the existence of the Nato reports and provided the Minister with sensitive details.
However, in the context of the two top officials, they pointed out that they had even pointed to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a dubious document by Commander Colonel Klein and a field strike report.
Wichert is about to have asked in a letter to clarify the case, reports the "Frankfurt General Sunday News".
He has not received an answer so far, that is.
The Ministry did not comment on the proposals on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Day's Committee of Inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens in bed, everything's fine.
If we are in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can safely give ourselves the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in growth see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered to be crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as specials.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mental illness or in drug abuse.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, make sure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality disappear.
Traumatically altered state of mind can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case wahn.
Even if triggers and effects differ, the visions of mysticist Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of intrusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the equilibrium of the neural cores of the brain – all in front of dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine – is impaired and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and unusual thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The context of Vahn and Dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle described hallucinations as a form of dream in the vague state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of Irish with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the insanity, madness, mind changes of such."
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. became a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
Gravity has no power over him anymore, he floats on the roof of the room.
He's feeling a step.
Behind him are flying devils with bloody, distorted phrases, toothpaste.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Sound, evil voices drain out of walls and radio.
He can't bear it any more, the voices that insult and politicize him.
Henning T. removes two cables from the stereo system, binds them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the deck.
He's going up to a speaker and he's lying around his neck.
Jumped.
The snake's getting loose.
This should be a lesson for you, the voices cry out in a drumming chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is called schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deep despair, he says.
The truck images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common post-depression disease.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, victims can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they are in a superior condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is the voice - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate importants from minors, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors for a flood of ideas and fantasies that create deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, obstetrician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning for it.
At the same time, he drives into a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenia therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the pictures are cruel reality, excluding awakening.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the mental and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The usual thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats Capriolen, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic setting for schizophrenia, but twinning studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in the case of the brain.
We suspect that neuronal brain maturation is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s virus disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But there is still a puzzle in how the neural system is disrupted, which is not manifesting itself first in many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the disposition is present.
hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmission system.
If our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others give out money for drugs to get, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Kasten.
Whether wear images are found to be pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of position.
Box has been collecting reports about hallucinations and trouser appearances for ten years, in the last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and thyroid trauma are often included.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself is hallucinating to healthy people.
Hallucinations, so boxed, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when the brain areas in which mental perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, love or other mental conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the high school.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
In the break it may occur that a slimy boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When he answers, the fellow students are surprised to see it - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They're holding the shy girl for a sloppy day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boys.
Am I crazy? She sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other truck pictures are not real and disappear again.
Nights are most frightening
Often the truck pictures are also a load.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations for all others hearing and visible at the table.
At night the appearances are most frightening.
If she is waiting in her dark room for sleep, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the phrases or the girl with the bloody cuts of arms and legs arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone.
Parents and friends don't tell them anything that would make them crazy.
In autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Last year, she lived with Abitur and lived with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in Internet contact with the psychologist box, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Vann is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a journey's pull, he is very likely after a while of hallucinations, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is under-worked and it takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish affected people like Sarah K., wearing pictures and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to arise, so they seem so real."
Also nightly dream images are considered boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mental health is capable of recognizing their portraits as unrealistic.
The box therefore advises its patients to evaluate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our highly conscious world, imaginary experience is usually pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creative – vague is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called oneuride experience form, a special form of the traumaticly changed consciousness.
Oniroides are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams that the experienced person considers to be real and that he cannot in the future be different from the state of growth.
Consciousness of oneuroide occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality by a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is happening in imagination.
An intensive form of sensitization and meditation in an unbearable situation that enables us to be able to design ourselves, not to fall into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The artist Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzevertel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years of age when his consciousness takes place after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation on journeys for days, while his body is condemned at the intensive station for mobility.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the eagles, which produce blood-derived drugs.
When a Greek is dragged on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean Mafiso.
It goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal journeys differ fundamentally from every dream for Clauses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are far more obvious to me after years and in the accompanying details.
Even more clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is exploding the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
At the end, oniroide, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite rich as well.
The snow breach can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new publisher Callen is an intermediate solution: Long-term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children are 27 years of age and have the will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only after that.
The question is whether they can do it.
It is not possible to provide 7500 employees with their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This also kills the children and the company.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the Board of Directors from January and named Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Call has been a member of the Board since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after Jürgen died, the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, therefore, there is no family member at the top of the edition.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of calls also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that family companies are not safe before the fall: "This has always affected families that were entwined by a search for capital that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no "world power dreams," says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political president of this country, as it was Springer, nor do I want to play with 'Time' in the world league, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other companies such as Hedonai, which provide for an entourage with lasers; Spaxion, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that produces more than 130 different tea varieties through its teahouse.
To enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours rent the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are just a few of the possibilities that the spaxion offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the most recent facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, by the way, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thereby provide them with a complete personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
Then show you various videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and exercise) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
If, after training your body, you still want to miss the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments to recover hair speech, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalised way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and so it is once again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their fixed clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the Silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. Of which you can only abrate.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that participates in the endesa with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the actions undertaken by the Government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we have a picture of the neglect and closure of some of our main production works," said the government president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain in the future, we can see a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than EUR 3 billion for investments.
The Chief of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the Government's efforts to boost demand, in line with the plan 2000E, which applies in cooperation with the autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the Chief of Government , this plan allows emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6 % , which in turn led to a "strong increase" in authorisations which increased by "40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Automotive Fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal der Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors are presented their brands.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all just earthly items related to the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
This allows exhibitors to find accessories, spare parts, components, materials accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines, which the collectors and lovers will be thrilled with.
Among the companies that will participate at this fair are among others Cásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurants; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Qualification tests in the Auven region

A skill test with classic cars and motorcycles is also carried out on a specially designed race track in the upper part of the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and drive system, baptized in the name i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 is highlighted by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the operation of the vehicle, the comfort, its steering behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
In addition, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
For further consideration of the unit, which consists of the instrument table and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda is red and blue with a variety of buttons and switches in the visible colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further saying that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, are of the utmost importance for German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than adequate comfort to allow four adults to drive too easily by car.
All of this comes with a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and drive system is now only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its gross comfort in walking and its low consumption, even though in Mazda the most sold diesel models are mainly.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the pilot is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series's equipment focuses mainly on the driver's track switch (RVM), which eliminates the dead angle, but also on the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal mirror, the table computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air-conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chromed 17-inch flags.
Furthermore, this version also includes, as if it were not yet equipped enough, the Premium package, which contains for an additional EUR 1,500: in addition to other elements, especially the Learnable Bixenon Headphones and the Sound System BOSE with CD charger.
Error
The Mazda3 2.0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not lay many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model, however, is a slightly high price, which is between €21.770 for the Luxury model and €23.270 for the tested sport model.
In contrast to this high price, however, Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest pass.
A premier with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls the red carpet of the sensitivity to Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, decided for a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can read only your emails without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it selected Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of an iPhone's flatrate.
After the company saw the success of this, it placed on the market two new devices: one that is meant only for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limits, like its American counterpart, but it has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to ignore all the data in order to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of rooming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but in my experience you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
Repeated criticism by the European Commission on affordable roaming tariffs for all of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you're always afraid to read your emails and that's right.
That a small device like FonPeek (but it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have WiFi) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other queries on the Internet is included.
No food and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and only one time, that is, when buying, is paid for, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a shopping option with life-long internet access as it already offers the Peek in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
Except I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the time of Barack Obama's entry as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this colour and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his undoubtedly second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: above that it was almost the same color - a brilliant green yellow - the dress consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the fabric they are made from.
At the opening of the office, she wore a top dress and in Oslo a modeled saddle.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half paragraphs and for the second time a narrow model, but gold colours.
Also, the hair was different: the hair was high on this occasion as a hairline, and on the previous occasion she was wearing the hair.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
This results in the study "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career prospects on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are serious differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not women work and if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract will be more mothers and more children.
On the contrary, women move with firm employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years of age after intercourse, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who relate to them and the first child has only achieved much later.
Auverdem also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar of reception,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is much higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary education or higher education, were on average 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, according to their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with primary education are already married before their first term of employment and have their first child, women with a secondary or high school degree are changing around and are only looking for a fixed term and then getting married and then getting their first child, Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also the widely known advertising discussion "Because you are worth it".
The leading performer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actors at international level, will become another famous hanging sign like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before them were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Milloaire").
In men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptions: Patrick Dempsey ("Gray ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox ("Lost").
The award of the UK fashion industry
The British in the fashion world have an important word to say.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was selected as the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures by Fernando Vicente) the three-fold X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither fears nor enlightenment.
Auber, that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: joy in contrast to unholy fate, moral without guilt and innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an alluring poetic humour, without any sense, like the knife sounds that would almost kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, dragged her whales into her arms, in whose flesh the emotions were united by the break of marriage with the pleasure of regret, a spiritual privilege in which it was to come to heaven on the path of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, one has to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbers are constantly trying themselves again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a comical causation.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a property owner of the county and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testify to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry, which was taken out of a bridge from that person from Munich, so that his echo would go deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this on a journey on which he fled before himself and with a speech full of violence against the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: My Lord, I beg you to do everything in your power to finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are embellished: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a slow life you find delights in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depressions in her bag.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotician, whose literary talent was still much bigger than their madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin-Santos do than try to implode Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet’s intention when he did not bring Baroja into the arms of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides the glory of that man, to destroy him so that he might put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada last week, as suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed by her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we got out of the animal house and weighs just six kilos, and then from this sky they missed him two steps and hurt him severely.
Our excitement cannot be taken for granted because it is not understood where the spasm is supposed to be at a cheap attack on a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
In addition, the stabbing attack that a woman who went for a friendly walk came when she wanted to justify these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a mad man attacks a dog, he may also be with a woman, a child, an older lord or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place in a normally quiet town district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog's been healing all day.
Of course, we have returned an advertisement in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our excitement over the incident has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal fun, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helm use especially among the younger motorbike drivers, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative seeks to draw attention to the importance of helm use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "is far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day", and further confirmed that they also contribute with other actions pedagogical and informative character to bring this goal closer to each day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase poster to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed to the development of ever safer products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles.
The sale of small trucks is increasing again
After almost two years, the car market for small carriers finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 % in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are thus at least the first growth after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, depending on the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer association and the Ganvam manufacturer association.
However, these good figures are only to be taken seriously at the moment, since the reference data used for comparison of November 2008 are a particularly bad marketing year with a 60% decrease in sales for the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles that make up the retail market include: passenger cars, pick-ups, small carriers, small delivery cars and lighter small trucks/cars.
Moreover, the same thunderstorms still remain in the sky, which most of the demand is brought into disrepute, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the bulk of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that are in almost 100% of all cases engaged in the purchase of a third-party financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the result of the reverse cash flow of the credit institutions, must include further factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the slowdown in the poor economic situation.
In this scenario and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to buy if they want to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam recalled that it was absolutely necessary for the State to pay particular attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Automers Association prophesied a similar year for the year 2010 as it has just been in the past, for which it accounts for a sales failure of 19 % (in the case of passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support in critical situations in the case of brake controls is now mandatory
As at the time of the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it now happens with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems need to be compulsory provision in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, and for the rest of the vehicles a deadline has been set until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's action is aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents because of their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake handle, which detects the system on the brake pedal according to the brake strength applied by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to enter the brake pedal and half of them had not been fired with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, with maximum force, the braking aid enters the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance which a vehicle has to withstand at the time of braking.
According to an EU study, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every 4th accident could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (over radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant shall exert maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel work team in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to see that the party concerned has already agreed to each single point of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be submitted until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that in the next few days a decision will be taken regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising, then, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American autobuilder to make this decision as soon as possible.
GM agrees to contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skype sports car, which has the Russian group Converg back cover, is becoming more and more demanding.
If no such buyer should come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to suspend Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
On the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and made it really easier to make it 80 kilos, so that it now only brings 1,275 kilos to the fore.
In order to create something like this, they refused the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a mobile roof with manual drive, so that one could save 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "lost" another 15; by the exception of the air conditioner again 13, by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, further 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sports bacquet seats again 12 times and with the light 19-inch flags five times.
Then, thanks to the abandonment of the audio system CDR-30 again, less than six kilos and through the exchange of the door handles through grips of fabric, the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling PDK drive, the test ride was carried out with a vehicle with 6-way hand drive, mainly on the smaller country tracks of California, on mountain tracks that really provide very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the note without tattoos.
However, the weight loss has nothing to do with the fact that he would no longer be so sure of the strike.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives a sense of greater security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to make his muscles warm at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the command to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he's told. The car does everything we tell him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as accurate.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all directions of taste
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as by a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time in the panamara.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, regardless of whether it is out of the stand or when it is re-accelerated.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and even though we found some of these curves ice in the morning gray and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it is said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it is rather rare and has much more than just a small improvement in the boxster ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics and an opportunity star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck hardness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basque Country gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many successful players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 when he visited the complex football field of Maccabi Electro and thus comes to the first place within his group after Mirza Teletovic's spectacular performance, which was with eight triples of the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant incidents of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a heavy dose of use and teamwork, even if they waited until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blues, who sat at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four bodies of the Vitoria team had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to realize that they had come to the field with well heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava decided to play an internal game of Barac and for the game of Elijahhu, which was received on his return to the team with beeps and applause, which is his home, to extend its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter already knows that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Despite the obvious advantage of the break, however, the game was not yet decided for long and the Maccabees wanted to remember once again that not everyone won on their field, and thanks to the ever-increasing "hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a couple of matches to get air back, and one of them suddenly came the Mirza Teletovic's pistols, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the display table showed a restorative distance from (54-67) which the host could decorate at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were bloated in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had truly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, who did not give the best of their team and tried to give their team back three points of strength from the line (70-77).
However, and even though splitter was set up because of mobs from the site, Ivanovic's team did not give up, and even though the Israelis recovered well in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Infringements prevented Unicaja from being offered the Styrene
Unicaja lost a lot in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was in a game that was marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the hostile team, which is perhaps one of Europe's strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusia could begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blended the host with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the union Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis found that in the 13th minute 22-20 the ad had shown her favor, the minutes in which, due to an action, it would almost have come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and its superiority over both parts of the game, while leaving England Joel Freeland because of an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez suffered significant consequences at Unicaja.
Among her players in the inner field and the Lithuanian previewer Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A retrieval hunt was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks on the team of Olympiacos, which in spite of his loss of 19 and even managed to compensate for the difference of the game published in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which again led the leadership within the group to collapse.
Unicaja tried to remove Robert Archibald from the many accidents and discharges of the shot wounded during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31 minute thanks to the spring management and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was hope for 66-57 again.
However, it was actually impossible since the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja had to be beaten and the leadership of the Olympiacos had to be withdrawn.
How much should you earn because of your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary due to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of properties, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn because of their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the user's salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. The user is provided with a Facebook form to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week, after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid" on average, explains Trovit responsible for the product Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has by its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros that a Spanish earns.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net amount of 34.247 Euro in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 Euro in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11.592 Euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 Euros and that of a worker with 15,667 Euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Honduras capital, confirmed to TV Globe that "Mel" had to leave before that date the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27th, because his mandate expires on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the former presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the election on November 29th (in which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed to recognize Zelayas' refusal to recognise the status of an asylum-seeker politician who wanted to be forced by the "de facto" government under Roberto Micheletti's chairmanship.
Thank you very much.
After the most daring days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a natural future.
The assumption used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to release the liquidity free hand at interest rates that move around zero, so that banks would buy assets to cancel out.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are as good as finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to shift some sand into gears, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox acquisitions, and we will be witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The fluctuations in stock exchanges and differences in company bonds are increasing, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to take their private risks into account and the debt of the State is increasing again.
One is now looking again at quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area with regard to Germany.
Spain had so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new review below regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not harmful to silence the moral risk defenders who once again tried to raise awareness among the world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, as they had lost the devastating effects of limiting loans to the loss of jobs if they had actually decided a new day to thank the action.
Nevertheless, what is happening in Dubai means a tribal war between the Emirs to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been foreseen.
A government that denies public debt, elections and a new government that pulls at the same strain.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus to allow a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens to take on the obligation to maintain the stability of the state funds when it comes to the need for overcrowding.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some fluctuations on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish were to be further increased, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutions to anticipate their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings do not promise a long life.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, even though at the time "preparation in driving" is said.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, took the lead yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave some points to the press about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion Euros and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not amount to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that there should be no more investment in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020, the issue will change and the performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the preconditions of other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy adopted by the government is in line with what his company has called for, did not want to say anything against this law about how to create incentives for national carbon consumption, which is exactly the opposite of all the political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, it is clear that in spite of some "individual" assumptions, the President of Iberdrola called it.
As far as it is concerned, Galán believes that the investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, since it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will have to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "handling" of Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the baggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is set up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation for the creation of an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona competes with Hightief and Bouygues for his first auto construction in Australia
Actiona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German High Court are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Actiona to establish itself as a construction company and a railway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project in accordance with a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and construction management.
In view of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion in Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 billion), with three consortia, mainly from European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Actiona, the consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which is again part of the ACS), the also local building stone (in possession of the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises powerful construction and privatisation, but it has to overcome a barrier that applies, since it is only through the purchase of a local construction company that has access.
A strategy that is followed by the so-called High or Bilfinger companies, in addition to Asian references, and which has to be followed only by the Spanish builders.
Even ACS has achieved access to this market only by its participation of 30% to the highest level, the owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Actiona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well-known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the extractive industry.
Among other assets, it has already established its largest wind mill park (192 MW) in Victoria and is leading the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's disposal facility with a budget of 700 million.
Its aim is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branch construction and infrastructure.
The underground runway, which will be supported by the infrastructure office of the city of Brisbane and which will be connected to the North Link (north torpedoes), aims to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the traffic track in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometres through the tunnel.
The roadmap issued by the city administration provides for the award of summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this route is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic mute system and a complex exhaust system.
The government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia gives high priority, which yesterday signed a contract with the Government of 154 million, again and again significant orders.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable through its own subsidiary Lighton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received 129 million high for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has provided its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers long for a railway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the award for construction work for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experiences in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010, and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
This contract also allows for two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies who have submitted their own competition to the race, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalties over 63 million for France Télécom due to the suspension of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of France.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and trust programmes for consumers at the regulatory edge.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 due to the handicap of its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was even increased because the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore become redundant again.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened up an application side in order to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions on the Internet.

The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed a source of income for the football club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since, which brings them to the third and fifth place of the football clubs, which have earned most of the money in the league.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
The Champions League of UEFA not only brings glory with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the large associations.
According to UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Women's Club is a third place in Europe, which has earned most of its money by its participation and the only one beside the AC Milan who has won the trophy three times.
The fifth place will be held by the incumbent Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992.
The list includes Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who received most of the money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that were able to take money through the Champions, although it has more title than everyone else (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini is in, is counting on revenue from the Champions League of 1,090 million.
From this money UEFA 413.1 million is available for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualification round (including the Atletice de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million due to their bluish presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is still a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided one (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the fourth final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, which receives 5.2 million.
In this way, a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million on fixed incomes.
With his victory, Barça won the European Supercup in August of 2.5 million.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337,8 million are provided.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
The master of last year receives 40 % of the allocated money, 30 % of the second, 20 % of the third place and 10 % of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in salt
The group Nouveau Rumasa had been able to secure details about the purchase offer of shares yesterday, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share paid up to ten years and with a interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects Sos's real rating.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a 15-day period to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV claimed that it was not informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
In the end, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to transform its management.
In an attempt to remain on the edge of possible purchase warrants and the judicial sources of his former manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit.
A decision to become the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created item, which is directly supported by the Chair of the Group.
This is all but free of controversy, because the company has become a court-martial because of the suspicion of redirection of more than 230 million from Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves further capital over the next month.
With regard to Salazar's credit, the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the relocation of 212 million without their appointment.
CNMV approves the public tender for parenterina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paternina last October.
The Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions of the law are complied with and therefore the contents of the declaration submitted, as amended by the last 2 December, can be regarded as "adequate".
CNMV has also announced that this offer for acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 Euro per share, which is again 8.95 % of the company’s capital, which consists of 6,142,786 Euros in shares granted by Madrid and Bilbao.
Auverdem was further informed that 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the end of the invitation to tender and whose price of Federico Paternina has been determined in accordance with the law.
New vehicle monitoring programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles that have been converted into an accident are dragged into workshops where a reviewer has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
Not a single accident is the same as calculating the costs for the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000 per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
For this reason, almost 100 % of respondents use these types of systems.
The service providers for accident and recovery assessment collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solara Group, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for monitoring and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is everything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it is being co-operated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is increasing to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been placed on the market than in the last fifteen years.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the company will start working.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the thousands of vehicles has to be catalysed and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intellectual" graphic image on which different parts of the vehicle can be "clicked".
If this is a very sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is soon ahead.
If this is a less useful car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with complete information.
Among the exclusive models they have, for example, information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet running on the rails, there are more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work there simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge information flow allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the car in Spain is Eurotax.
Audex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the review of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily provide an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution to prevent accidents for the investigators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the repair times or the painting prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive it will be for customers who rarely use it, up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 Euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audex.
With other products such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it went from the mounting band only on the basis of the vehicle identification number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle drives, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which you can provide for vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be used because of tires in the workshop or how many of them had developed into a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimates, which is also intended for reviewers, providing the same type of digital images, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.

Disposal of automobiles on the Internet
Last October, the Solara Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of automobiles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85 % of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value added, with the possibility to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service applies exclusively to professionals such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, garbage shops and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle registration number has been registered may no longer ride the tramway, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-approved even if they have been registered after difficult authorities.
Cost proposal of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost proposal.
The easy management of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified according to the vehicle identification number, a graph of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, prices or discounts and then print the cost proposal and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller is, however, not a check tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that this does not include the estimated working hours targeted at the workshop.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further payment.
Currently, the company Audex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for the car mechanics for a long time since you can select a door with it, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
