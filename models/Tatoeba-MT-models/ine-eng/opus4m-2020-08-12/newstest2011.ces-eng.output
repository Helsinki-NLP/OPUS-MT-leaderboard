ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugarcane
The new ČSSD city council will have to overcome a certain language barrier, according to all, in order to understand in the Prague Council and in the representation of their old colleagues from the ODS.
Dník Aktuálně.cz members of the new board of ČSSD "taste", as they know the notoriously introduced slang that emerged on the council during the last years when Prague ruled the present coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which the Prague politician introduced during the previous era of the Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situation and cause in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new counseling concepts are not too familiar.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novelist in Prague politics," responded to the "Kmotrovský" dictionary test as an adviser to the culture of Lukaš Kaucký.
And as far as the political veteran was concerned, so did counsellor Karel Brezin.
Maybe the term "golf cave."
"It's the only expression of what you introduce to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't know the slang in general."
From the dictionary, which the daily Aktuálné.cz published this June before the ODS election congress, she chose the edition of six examples, mostly those that are notatorically linked to the Prague magistrate.
The socialists were supposed to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the sugar shop", "bitch neck", "the betrayal of the main city" and "treasure".
Three of the councillors agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to lead the Prague school in the future - promised the first conversation, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor Petr Dolinek just refused the test.
"I am not going to solve this thing at all, and I will not appreciate how the citizens of the democratic community are doing."
"I now decide how we will understand within our programmes," he replied.
As it has already become clear, Councillor Lukas Kaucký would not have understood, in the title above, that it is about the influential entrepreneur and friend of the spokesperson of Bem Roman Januskov.
"Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucké and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, and he immediately adds, "But I know it from the news."
"I'll have to pay some language courses," he jokes.
The Golf Cave then decoupled not only the Matador Karel Brezina, but also the environmental advisor Lukaš Plachý.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachém is aware of where to find this character - is aware of the meaning of the term "to go to the sugar shop".
"I mean to go to some Prague company," is the Plague close to the dissolution that this is the residence of Janousk companies.
According to Brzezin, it reminds us that knowledge has been drawn from the news rather than from the use of such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test frequencies, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've been working with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes the names are used short and the names are combined," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský, whose parties are nicknamed Hulda.
"I was called Bríza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina admits.
Newspaper.cz tested the name and works.
The council Weinert is for the parties Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, Deputy Miroslav Poche, who has warned himself of fraud in sponsoring the party, has a nickname "Playing".
Surnames are also the only thing social democrats admit in an internal speech.
The Huldus is not pleased with the Huldus, but the daily Aktuálně.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague President.
"Doctor of the Tourist Law" may remind us that Petr Hulínský won his title at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "magic", she published the brochure
The women declared in Burkina Faso as witches have several common signs.
They're more of an older generation, they can't get involved in work for health reasons, they're free and they don't have kids.
The one who becomes a witch is sent into isolation to keep the rest of the village safe.
"This fate can only be very rare."
"They don't even blame young healthy women because they help with work and give birth to children," describes a sister who is aged in a special house in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, more than a hundred women, whose community has grown up.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information brochure that should help the witch hunt to limit.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," noted Die Standard's newspaper.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, who lives next week with Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died 20 years after three women and two men tortured her, oiled her and burned her.
The case was informed by the BBC server.
The plotters claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was made up of oil that is used for ritual anointing.
He paid off after the group wanted to get out of a woman's bad spirit.
The isolation of "magic" supports people regardless of the level of education they have achieved.
Dinik Der Standard quoted Burkina Faso's twenty-two-two-year-old businessman as saying, "People's fires have always been dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso a witch hunt tries to soften the government, in Gambia, he was attended by the president himself last year.
"The Gambian President Jammy broke up his aunt's extensive hunt for witches, who were supposed to share in her death and try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"To help, he called on the shamans from nearby Guinea, who, following police, soldiers and the President's personal protection, violently drove randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the Canilai president's farm," Amnesty International reported in its report.
On the farm, people had to drink a herbal medicine with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released for freedom.
Bakal's tenant: Tops in stones, higher rent signed
The older subsadite man stepped out of the door of the client centre of RPG Apartments "ochlobarona" Zdeněka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under surveillance he carried a file and a new lease in it to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who are in execution of the penalty.
All three of them just took off their rent.
Instead of 3500 months from next year, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And it's not hot water there, and it's got to warm up with petrama (stone for solid fuel, late red). "A man's finger in his son's new contract, on which his signature has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half-inflicted and half-inflicted.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Society, which has designated new lease terms as "unfair and immoral", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7th, when it publishes instructions on how to deal with them.
But the man has his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," it's dark.
Island becomes a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year's, a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are waiting for non-market rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
Havířůvska's waiting room RPG is one of the four in Ostravska and is already full on Tuesday at nine in the morning.
The security agency and the trigger device shall immediately stand next to the door.
"Rent 2011", lights a special button on his touch display.
One knock and a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already on a big display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're in line in half a second.
After a while, the rent comes to ask the older couple, but the raid in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rentals.
Most people have come to solve common problems like other - requests for repairs, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new leases are received in Ostravska in mailboxes by most tenants of a total of 44,000 RPG portfolios about half of November.
RPG Apartments in letters suggest an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special booking for new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs for a week, so it's just running," the labs are responsible for the rescue after a moment of weighing when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former top apartments are local exciting themes.
Before the elections, he was taken by the vice-president of Parliament and the island relative Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, and even now he is filled with local newspapers.
"Twent years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't change my toilet board either," says the man in the introduction.
Most employees still come to see if they can get a discount from the rent if they sign up in time for the RPG in the special offer.
A half-dollar discount on February's rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
Havírův's "deregulation" overrun, but the questions are definitely not counted.
"From the 360 customers yesterday for the 2011 lease, there were only about forty to fifty people," the workers estimate for backup.
The RPG, however, proposes an individual meeting of contracts on the web and its walls where it will be needed.
However, if both parties do not agree to the lease, they will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not about threats, but about information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal process," the RPG points out on its pages.
"There will be no judge here," thinks one of RPG Apartments' employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her partly for the truth.
"I have 13,000 pensions and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have to judge," he says.
The workers, however, will only be destroyed.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Apartment, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rental is still not enough for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Apartment, that the fact that the tenant is just angry about the neglect of the housing fund is, according to home owners, the main reason for the increase in rentals.
While between 2005 and 2010, RPG from rentals could invest in apartments of four billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
A large screen hanging at the ceiling against the cushioned seats of the casualty waiting room so far repeats a few redly highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15% and less affects 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be more than 7.50 Kč per meter square and month," it will appear on the screen.
Only in 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will the rent rise by 38%.
"In these cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19.66 Kč per square metre," RPG notes.
The 2600 apartments will remain the same for the next year.
The RPG Apartments promise that deregulation will not cover rents in a jump, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another obligation: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, mainly to the heat savings - new windows and heating.
They should be given priority to people who sign a lease agreement.
The office also includes a school, understanding architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide a miniskirt with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, fancy furniture, a toy and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it has been visited by Arch.Design employees.
Arch.Design, from which the workshops took up a number of important Brno buildings, was built with space for its company miniskirt since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
Because he employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and cares that women designers and architects can return to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of short-term engagements, Arch.Design offers its employees the benefit of the social program.
Buildings and architects thus have the opportunity to engage in demanding employment with child care.
Arch's own employees invented the mini-school.The design and management support they managed to obtain the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs grant.
The Company Mining is financed from the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
The grant funding (a grant of CZK 2,8 million) enabled the purchase of equipment and equipment and provided qualified personnel and operations for a period of two years.
After a financial grant has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mine at its own cost for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and with a request for a grant significantly helped Economy Rating.
Caring for qualified staff, caring for the children all day long, and teaching MS, can therefore go to school without an age limit, yet most of them are older than 3 years old.
Since it's a "ministry", there can be only 5 children at the same time, but more can be achieved during the day.
School running is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programme filling in the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality training - from basic knowledge to after preparation for school lessons, they are also learning English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop stress situations with late child rearing from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working time more productively.
No wonder there is a natural relationship between the employee and the employee.
Arch.Design has thus arranged for Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house of the bone fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like a tomb of the old pond, the staircase resembles five dinosaurs, and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the home of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house thanks to its organic forms, he earned the last name of the House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaics, façade reminiscent of mushrooms and all present soft curves, all of this is typical for the session of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house features dream lines, soft colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
When you look at it in detail, you can see geometry, rhythm, and exactly the thought order.
In the night, the whole façade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is lit up so that the impression of light colors is further strengthened.
Guilt and distortion of shapes appear to the same extent in interiors.
The wood in the waves copies the juniper frames, the curtains, the decorative elements of the door, the cockpit and leaves.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the ruins shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No 43, was rebuilt in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on renovating the old building and building completely new, but soon Gaudi’s idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction was accepted.
But Antoni Gaudí didn't propose to the house of Casa Batlló.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
At his design stage, decorations were made for the representative apartment owners of the property and the use of the mosaic on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the design of Casa Batlló's house started successful collaboration with Jujol and Gaudí.
Juliol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Güell Park, where there are other Gaudi's works.
From the local house of departure, after finishing, he earned the name "House of Bones" because of his organic forms.
Others called him a "living house" because of the specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also said that on the top of the building there is the sword of St. Jir, patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motives also contain other elements of the building.
Gaudi has designed a unique central heating system with wind currents and typical fireplaces for his time.
Bizarn may seem to be their forty-five degree slope.
When Gaudí was created, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations at that time and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the building, however, the construction permit was obtained from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction was so heavy that two years later the city council was threatened and requested repair.
For example, counseling was based on the fact that the building interfered with the pillars even in the public corridor.
No correction was ever made, but only 15 days after the city's call, Joseph Batlló requested permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
On the second floor there was a social lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The land was rented to a priestly.
The whole six-storey house overlooks the staircase, which can be stepped up to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably without at the same time maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate discussions.
In addition to the new facade, Gaudi's house has also acquired an untraditional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which cover the inner courtyard, and lights, is also effective.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply to bet on the principle that the white reflects the light more than the darkness, which the sun shines rather than swallows.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and proudest apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The visit was delayed because they found it to be a very beneficial business and, in addition, extended the visit to common and subterranean spaces, including roof terraces.
The entry into memory is certainly not negligible, making 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist licences have a 20% discount.
The sum exceeds significantly the price of entering Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dragon bats, you need to quickly chat with some of the people of the canyon and visit it directly at home.
How to pick mattresses and grow: women have requirements other than men
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
However, it must be harmoniously supplemented to suit the specific user.
In choosing, he decides many things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owners.
Also important is the type of interior to which mattresses and growth are cut.
Typical example?
Maybe on weekends, where they don't melt regularly, they're not suitable latex mattresses, because they're slowing down.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn regularly.
Because if they don't have a lot of respiratory channels in the core and they're still on the solid surface, they're keeping the moisture: it could also be a wet spot.
He also decides on habits when choosing.
Anyone who has spent a longer time abroad, where high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their broken shoulders, legs and sides needed mattresses with a softening layer of linen foam."
"These are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they mistake "information" from hips and skin," explains Sylva Hadamkijk, who specializes in the well-known furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were therefore caught by a line of mattresses with a foam line years ago.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to evaluate the foam line.
This miracle works easily.
Optimizes your density and shape according to the absorbed heat or adjusts to your warm body.
Nothing's gonna make you feel any better. You won't turn around tonight like you're having a hard fight.
Just get some sleep.
The foam line also works as a protection against stretchers.
When selecting the size of the mattress at your height, add another length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in a double, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands slightly shaken in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, Czech masterpiece of chaplains and decorators, who has been spending a number of years on the problem of healthy sleeping and ergonomic furniture and is teaching it at professional schools.
For doubles, you need each of your own growth and mattresses, but here you have to be careful when buying them, so that you can smooth the mattress heights.
Otherwise there will be nothing other than mounting the lawns to different heights, but you don't have to succeed at every frame of the bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a threshold of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters shall be calculated on the forming and cirrhosis layer.
"If you touch your hand or reach the mattress, you must certainly not feel the spring," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The whole bed, when the mattresses and the floor are like grown Siamese twins, don't have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are miswinding, they can't be washed out, which is already common today.
And since we usually get 0.2 to 0.75 litres per night, it's clear that after five to seven years of maturing, one large (and nestled) net starts to be remembered.
This is why experts reject advertising slogans on life expectancy up to 25 years, or even life assurances.
It's all his own, though.
And therefore advice from practice from sellers: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm hygiene and work, do not give up a removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mating moves are usually produced today, the whole circuit is shaken, so we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when filming might remind us of the struggle of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grill?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night's visits.
However, take care of the disc (if it is no longer in use) with the ventilation openings and use the mattress with a spring rib and a height of at least 15 cm with the spring in the bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and the Cypriot layer.
Polyurethane mattresses on such a base do not belong.
On non-positional lambel vegetables 14 to 18 lambel will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (the combination of latex and coconut) but you will always be paid for more lambel, 28 and more, where lambel are in the area of beder double and can be adjusted for density.
The positioning lamel crop does not belong to the matrices with the porous bone, because they do not respond to the position.
In addition to the thickness setting, the so-called shoulder strap may be broken.
It's a special trap of lamels, which allows you to push, or even bend the lamela so that the shoulder sleeps well "forgets".
For men who have "arms all over the back", it's definitely important.
It is even remembered by the matrices producers who in the "Spanish" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they prefer soft surfaces in the hives.
For the most demanding customers, the so-called "multitoral spring" is intended to be made with the wings or flakes.
The pressure breaks down to several points and decreases tension.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grow the wrong pillow (large and "enriched"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the wrist should support the head and aim only at the shoulders in order to relax the shoulder muscles.
As an appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the shoulderrest should be adjusted (with shoulder strap roll or laminated area in the mattress) to the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have nothing to do with original strawberries filled with grass.
Its producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
Trendem was just in high school.
Oil raw materials from which polyurethane foam is produced are replaced by natural oils such as hops and soybeans.
The soybean is used by all known manufacturers.
"It was at maturing that means that the core is made of pure material of natural origin," explains Petr Vasiček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy the microcaps to relax your fresh taste of wood or lavender.
There's also a division for men and women.
While a man "shrews" a plant extract from his belly to absorb heat and cool the body, women "shrew".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it's a weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
Matrices made from cold foam (it has more pores with damaged cellular structure, is more breathable than normal polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
Combined with various densityes of cold foams and "line" foams arise multi-story mattresses that know exactly where to be head, thigh and legs.
You'll pay seven thousand crowns and higher for quality mattresses.
Those who fulfil health parameters have a lower VAT rate, are gated as health aids.
As the first to arrive in the Czech Republic for this advantage Gumotex.
Saving on mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes it may be necessary to use the actions of manufacturers or sellers offering two mattresses at the price of one.
Maybe the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with all the memory song Memory in the draw for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can be arranged free of charge.
The era of lines or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density began with the "space" tempo of Tempur material.
It was originally produced as a material for NASA because at the beginning astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat cools, the cold gets stronger.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and spreads its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the emergence of paralysis, but also to increase comfort in sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, need for special pillows under the legs that relax the legs and the digestive system.
The producers here use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and so on.
People's monitoring devices want more parents to clean up their children
The fear of their own child has led more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally created for car search can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatkov.
The device is probably a big box of cheese so far, but it can only be big as hours.
A number of people were frightened of the missing Anička case and began to beg for the means to protect their children better.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that there is no spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that some tragedy will occur," says Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of monitoring devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case there may be abuse of such devices, even if they are put into someone who doesn't know, but we haven't met with such a case."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," added Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how it is used in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologist Dan Boczová points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like this, he'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things in a way that is approved if they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations have been raised earlier with mobile parents, however, which can be turned off as well as these monitoring devices," Bockova claims.
It also argues whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to the planned kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child has no electronics that could reveal his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the monitoring devices begin to expand, they will also search for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always step forward before the police," the psychologist says.
However, they admit that similar devices can help in the event of an unexpected attack by pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and individuals, even in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The device may be set to send the position regularly after a certain time has elapsed."
"If his damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned shall be available."
"The expensive devices have built-in and tilting meters, so even if a person just hid and remained motionless, the device will immediately send a warning message with the position," the Czech says.
According to him, a similar service can also carry out smart mobile phones with navigation where you can also record special software.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is either a device similar to the trailer size of the box from sires or smaller mobile phones.
That's how their loss always threatens them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like regular digital clocks are now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that any aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or she's known for some time and it can give the police more time," he adds.
Whether the monitoring devices are already developed into straps or trailers, they will still use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
This is a combination of positioning via GPS (using normal autonavigation) and mobile phone function, which reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting wire to round up the Czech Republic, but it will last only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres of wires that fire the shops.
Last year, however, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometers of wires to the warehouses.
The Army has 225 years of stock.
The problem is that the longevity of wires is two, up to four years.
The army bought fire wires from the action STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff, on the basis of the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNA-inflammatory wires, reported that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of fires annually.
However, from the draft military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES has referred to, it appears that all generals, army commanders, secretaries or cleaning officers would then have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are not taking out.
That's the only way to justify the military's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of fire.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that were true, military supplies would last for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be paid that the basic training of each new professional is enough for a maximum of two metres of fire-fighting wires, as experts say, the army has provided with a fresh purchase - even with the increased consumption of female or special units - supplies for the 225 years mentioned.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade, however, have recently complained to Minister Vondro that they do not have almost any gun attacks, so the shootings due to the need for money are also limited.
Not talking about lack of underwear.
"So my head doesn't feel like they're buying so many fires from us all over again."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"For us, an army is a good customer, whom we as traders are trying to make up for," says commercial manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
The Defence Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek is justified by hundreds of kilometres of wires purchased and by the fact that the army will have the resources of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děký from the STV Group is only talking about four years of fire and police or army pyrotechnics even for two years.
"With perfect storage it may be the four," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish a name because of the criticism of the army.
After the passing of life, each amulet must carefully test whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers in life.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry is a quantitative discount of 445 kilometres of fire wires.
"We have become sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," explains Pejšek, an interpreter of the opinion of the Ministry of Defence's Ministry of Commerce.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of firearms by police pyrotechnics that eliminate ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet army does not exceed 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police always order only so much that this munitions can consume before life goes down.
It was proved to her for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of wires.
The Ministry of Defence is already having significant difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition since the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-six-six-six-six-slovenia-Slovene army was preparing to move to Rýn.
Here, according to the pyrotechnics MF DNA has referred to, the same problem awaits in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fires that "lacino" buys today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I have gained through the competition
The winner of the contest The Year's Lifemaker helped Lukas Pytloun to sell his French hotel.
The winner of last year's competition The Lifemaker of the year became an 18-year-old businessman named Lukas Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lucas Pytlon liked to travel.
And in a foreign country, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberia.
He bought a semi-detached house with five apartments from foreign brigades and using bank credit.
Since he was still a student of the third year of high school, he was very brave.
"The current relationship between the quality and the price of our accommodation did not allow me to try to do anything about it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment started renting to foreign workers.
All profits were invested back into the house, which gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with total capacity over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the recently four-star Pytlou design hotel.
But this year he came to him with another, equally quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Tisá Island, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties about the French hotel Pytloun report," says last year's businessman number one.
"And for this sale the license to operate the hotel was largely won in the competition for the Year of Life," Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberca and the surrounding area.
"People knew me on the streets, often congratulated me more and I have to say it was nice," she recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every sighting is good.
He says he's still drawing from contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to.
"With some of the competition I met, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success according to him has reached a little of every employee.
And he's got about 70 of them.
"I observe greater loyalty and pride in sharing in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of a good job of all of us together."
"Only my name is thrown into the front," said modestly today Lukás Pytloun.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory quickly eliminated the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner, however, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žjárský, came to Slovakia last year.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he had made to build a small tool shop in the Czech Skalic company with stamilion plants.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and increased our awareness of the competition," the winner said today.
At the beginning of Farm's history, it was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karl Žjárské's father to rent a small store as a compensation for the communists, he didn't hesitate long, refused a career in the company where he worked, and with a few friends around his father they founded a company on plastic baths.
Soon afterward, they began specializing in vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturers of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
A greater awareness among the unskilled public was achieved after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farm brand much better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they are working with the company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žjárský.
Last year, however, he wasn't only in Farmet for the euphoria of victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And it was the year 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery.
It was a crisis that has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation has not, of course, been avoided by us."
"The markets fell by 40%, we had to limit production and there was also a release," explains Karel Žjárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such non-popular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, even though I was less than before the crisis.
But what they didn't get out of in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre with grants, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won a major award at home exhibitions," Žjárský says.
It all testifies that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žjárský.
A survey to remove pointless rules
A survey of the Year's Absurdity is a quarter of the corporate payroll.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded.
An unusual winner of the next year's Absurdita survey became obliged to wear documents that are also available to officials online.
She has decided more than a third of all four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration required a paper receipt from the trade register, although the official can obtain it by two clicks.
Thanks to the survey, it'll change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a commercial registration for checks on the payer," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
To shed light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to destroy them in the sense of the absurdity competition of the year.
This year it is already the fourth part of the business payroll organised by the Economic News and among the public it is becoming increasingly popular.
If there were about three thousand voters in the polls, they were no longer worth four thousand this year.
And there's no surprise, the most diverse legal obligations that serve only to keep businesses, we still have enough.
"We must be in the number of registers for tax admission in the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of businesses has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in any way.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the business conditions, the Czech Republic has placed itself at 74th position, which is about eight places worse than last year.
The absurdity competition of the year was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can be logged in every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The website www.firmaroku.cz then selects seven candidates for "antique" and lets the public vote on it in October over the internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, precisely 105 regulations and demeaning regulations have been submitted to the survey this year.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional liaisons and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competitions, for example, there was a requirement among the nominated, for example, that road and road maintenance vehicles pay bribery or that businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of proposals this year is published on competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Václav Square in Prague, is part of an open-ended event that regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Freebod, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Economics.
"The economic prosperity cannot function where the state throws the business under foot, so my aim is to cancel every year at least three dozen paragraphs which today only make the business too complicated," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break the foolish regulation doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, the most people felt obliged to report to the company three days in advance to the company in the place where the permanent establishment is located, with the intention of taking a stand on the exhibition or tour.
This obligation was removed by a new life law.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was declared by the Office of Labour for its foreign staff to be a service trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And one third of everything good.
An absurd regulation for physiotherapists in 2009 was to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two inflatable weights in the office.
This was done in this year by the Ministry of Health's announcement - the obligation to have a refrigerator has dropped.
The new category assesses the company responsible
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects will be evaluated.
New this year already the fifth year of the competition for Economic News is called the Responsible Company 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholda, regional manager of a mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebellion of the year.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company’s main competition in 2010 has been signed up to companies for which there is no success in undertaking the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspirational and would be published on its own.
Although the subject matter of its activity varies from one to the other in diameter, their efforts can be viewed as support and consideration for the common denominator.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere need personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen full Republic finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of the company in charge from the Pardubský region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor of the funding fund for children with disabilities for seventeen years.
About his health - affected employee, the old paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 per cent of them, has thus received the title of the responsible company of the Central Czech Republic and has been placed in the country as a third in the Vodafone Company competition of the year.
On Olomouck, the accounting company MiRyz Soft won, which introduced a flexible working time, further reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a moderate reduction in pay.
The board has also given it its title because it purchases mainly from Czech producers, supports civil activities in the near environment and saves the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administrations have as little environmental impact as possible," explains actor Miloše Ryznar.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústecka Country again thinks about the health of his employees and distributes ergonomic chairs and keyboards to each notebook, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided locally protected by the company.
"In addition, we support the foundation of a man in the pressure that helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřij Suchý.
Finally, it is also worth mentioning the activities of the company Prani and cleaning from the state of Karlovarska, which contributes to their pension insurance by way of over-standard bonuses to its employees.
"We are again making contributions to food, transport, qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapác of the Bruntal construction firm Czasch, the winner of the Moravian Region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically registered with all the national finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the editor by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the author.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the contest The responsible company of the year, but were not disqualified from the "main" contest of the Vodafone Company of the year."
"It is not possible only to register in this competition because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the company year," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose publishing agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzny Police Arrested in Public Competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzni, anti-corruption police were arrested in the past few days.
The railway detectives sat down with the local businessman in the media and the businessman with the realities of Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle the claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a particular interested party.
That's what Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"I can only confirm that the police are suing one person for breach of the pleas for public procurement and public competition," said Plenary State Representative Antonio Zelena, the Law Head of the Plenary State, saying that further details cannot be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four years old, the policemen were released after 24 hours.
The way in which public competition could have been influenced is only to be speculated in the light of minimum official information.
Speaking by the Land Fund Lubomíra Montenegro on the question of the Law said that at a separate workplace in Plšno, police officers were actually arrested during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition has according to Black correct title "Call for tendering of land transfer orders under the Land Act" and will take place where more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons, within the scope of the call, offer a higher value of their claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the tenders, the order of buyers will be established and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the speaker explained to the Fund.
Luboš G. evidently had information about the applicant and because he is also a legitimate person, since he has collected a number of refund claims, he has offered interested parties the land that the competition is not taking part.
He's indicted the derogators for that.
That would explain that he had so much money in custody.
Lubosh G. had over-standard PF contacts in Plzi in the past.
He appeared in the case of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was convicted for issuing in return the land on which a decision was already taken to locate the building.
At that time Luboš G. obtained land from the fund, for example, for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the entry magistrates were to be built into the Borská field industrial area.
Later he changed them very well with the magistrate behind the house in the very historic center of the city, which had much higher value.
At that time, the mayor had to join the building because otherwise it would endanger the building by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and steam, heat supplies and some sort of growth and rent.
So families will have to withdraw from the ice cream from their wallets to hundreds of crowns monthly more than now.
The electricity saves up to 4.6 percent, the gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, while in some cities you will have to pay for supplies of water and many of them also interfere with supplies of central heat.
Contamination of electricity should be carried out annually by households in the apartments of cattle cattle before now.
Energy prices have decreased while all main suppliers have decreased, so there is a significant increase in support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaic.
However, the gas is slowly saving, but at a time when people are the most melting and so have the highest consumption.
It must also be added to the hundreds of crowns each year.
While electricity and gas supply across the Republic, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
Price increases are planned mainly by a larger municipality.
For example, the house in Pardubice or Hradci Krállová will pay from January for central heating about 50 crowns a month plus, more than 1000 crowns will pay the families in Liberca annually.
The people of Prague are again threatened by more than 9 per cent of the city’s water and water supply, in case the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Praguen 6.8% will be paid.
However, the price in Prague will continue to be lower in the overall comparison between the whole Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already amongst the highest, water and ponds have to yield 7.4 per cent.
For example, they can significantly increase the price of rent in 450 thousand rental apartments where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Apartment, which in Ústí nad Labem owns some 2,500 apartments, intends to increase rent by up to a hundred percent since January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent are going to bring the company to court.
Regular rents paid by people in about 300 thousand apartments could grow by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children drink fernet and rum. Beer is fashionable, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that end most often in the care of alcoholic doctors, who haven't even been 15 years.
They are not an exception for children who are being treated again in the hospital from the monkey.
This comes from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the children’s hospital ward.
"Non-beers or wines are totally immodest, because they take a long time to drink."
"Trendem is certainly a hard alcohol," said the law prime minister of the Children's Department of the Horovice Hospital in the Central Czech Republic.
"If they can pull a bottle out of the box, it's probably whiskey, but it's a fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage that they pour it into the juice and it's not that much of them to feel," explained the principal.
And for the truth, he's also the speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common is fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases it was a sliver brought from home," said Jurin.
According to the Pelican prime minister, 13 or 14 years of drinking on hospital income is a relatively common phenomenon.
He worked for ten years at a pediatrician in Motole, where the sanitaries are accommodating educated students from a wide area.
"A girl lay with us about four times."
"The career began in twelve years when she was brought to us with 3.5 miles of alcohol in the blood, plus in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the showhouse in Holeshovich at some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," he looked at the principal.
It is not in the interests of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drink their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the right sense, according to experts in children.
"Under the concept of alcohol, there are several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and it's not for children."
"For those who drink alcohol over and over again, there is a more peculiar unreported family-social background," explained the mayor of Pelicán.
According to spokesman Jurina’s this year at a pediatric clinic in Motole, about 40 children were hospitalized in mid-November.
However, only those with severe poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children drinkers who take their parents away after an ambulance treatment, if they're at home transporting the police, aren't counting at all.
In addition to cases where children just sit around the school and drink a bottle of chicken, there are three seasonal exercises according to Pelicán on which you can rely: witches, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"It's either they're sorry about the wrong confession or they're celebrating the beginning of the holiday."
"However, I've experienced a witch on income and seven children's drinks all at once," said Pelicán.
The alcoholic who spends the night of detoxification under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in favour of the one who suffers from unpleasant cocoon at home the next day.
Early headache caused by dehydrated and lack of glucose is due to an induction of an induction infusion with glucose and animals missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it because they have a nice evening experience and good awakening and nothing else."
"There are only confusions from where they are," Pelikán admitted, saying that sometimes it would damage patients' enjoyment of at least the cost that their treatment required.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on the emergency bed will also amount to tens of thousands of crowns.
"At the moment I applied it as a means of education, when I calculated directly to those children on the visit how much their alcohol was being consumed and that they could also spend the whole summer at the brigade to earn for that one party," Pelicán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies are not accessing regressive treatment costs for their parents in the case of child alcoholics.
Two L-159 planes are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 flights from the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced Casa C-295M by a transport plane, went to Spanish Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS.
For the first time, machines of this kind have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've been abroad for years of practice or instruction.
It's a double version of L-159T1, which has so far been operated by the Czech army and which have been able to fly.
The remaining three machines are single L-159.
They are still being booked in Aeru Vorody and the trade broker - Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When the planes physically depart from the waterfront, it is not known according to Jan Pejška from the Defence Press Committee.
"The L-159 single aircraft for the exchange were separated from the long-term saved aircraft, without any other contributions and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"Two-dimensional L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said Law of Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without two-seat aircraft, because in May 2009 the Ministry signed a 200 million crown contract with Air Waterford to convert four L-159 needed machines into two-seat machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejska, EADS has committed itself to deploying aircraft into the arms of some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 air carrier is an EADS company and will serve to train NATO pilots."
"That's why it's the recipient's stuff, how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
Before long, the Economic News reported that, for example, the Spanish army of L-159 had no interest.
The exchange of five L-159 for one flight Casa and the purchase of three more flights for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the Mirka Topolánka government last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the election procedure and addressed directly to the EADS.
The current defence management argued that the change would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and only uses 24, the rest of them would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's aircraft is likely to have a court-martial.
The European Commission therefore appealed to the European Court of Justice by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the choice of aircraft on the basis of a whole European trend and not by the designation of one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's aircraft, the last one should have arrived at Kbela's Prague airport within fourteen days.
A longer indicator than a ring means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator longer than a ring are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to the study published by the British journal of cancer on Wednesday.
It can be related to the male hormone testosterone level.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years," said a co-author of the study Ros Eeles, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other hazardous factors such as family health burden, added Eles.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and more than three thousand healthy men were monitored with colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had a right-hand indicator shorter than a ring.
They paid the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had an indicator longer than a ring, however, this risk was reduced by 33 per cent, making a reduction of up to 87 per cent for men to 60.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - made during the prenatal period - is likely to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the diaphragm.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone alone supports the growth of prostate cancer.
The former Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes told the ČTK that he knew about this study in earnest, but he does not seem to think that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer would be "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways are mostly snowed, roadmen in many places have been driving all night.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 kilometres towards the divorce is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 at Brno towards Prague.
According to the news, the dispatcher of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK) said so.
There was a truck crash at 91 kilometers, there was two trucks crashing at 93 kilometers, and there was an accident.
Several cars ended up in the backyard.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 kilometres towards Prague.
Two trucks got in there.
Drivers should ride close to Brno at 190 km or drive across Brno and then ride at 182 km on Kjvalce.
There's a couple of miles of columns.
There's also an accident at the D11 Road, which is immediately upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a few centimeters of snow, temperatures show a minus seven degrees Celsius.
The car columns form, for example, on Prosek, which is also engraved in Sterboholic.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Tramvaje rides with a delay, for example, on the track between Karl's Square and the Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team is to be re-established.
There are also problems with railways and airports.
The Czech roads had already had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
Problems, for example, have a track from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Berun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. at 5:00 p.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already starved, but only with increased caution.
On Vyškovsk there are three road roads, in Brnońsk snow-languages are formed, and in Blanensk some communications are needed in the snow chain.
Vyskovska was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
They're gonna have to put the wires on.
When they're driven, they can't be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the White Carpathians.
On roads which are maintained only by inert sissy for nature protection, it is therefore up to a five-inch layer of snow, the ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, there was an attack from two to ten centimeters of snow, most of which fell in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravskoslese region, about 15 centimeters of snow were attacked.
Snowing in the Czech Republic is getting up gradually.
American soldiers have a new "wise weapon"
The U.S. Army has installed a new "wise" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
Generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Its missiles indicate a laser with accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing a high explosive market, actually work like small grenades.
The rounds can be programmed in such a way that they will explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic course.
Therefore, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall, or a pit.
Because Shora is usually not protected, and when it is hit by a deadly rain of steel bolts, it can be removed from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for football, which uses "wise" technology.
"The soldier basically starts to find a target, sends a laser beam to him that determines the distance, then gets a precise point of intent, according to him adjusts the direction and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press the gun, the gun will be charged and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audiette said.
Moved to 400 places of employment
The Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their workplace in July next year from the former administrative building to Marienbader-mämstět in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japan Fujits Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As a giant in the field specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women move from their former administrative building to Marienbader-major in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyons Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the Fujist speaker, there should be another 100 jobs in the group that are currently divided into the region at the appropriate time.
The offer of rent was very attractive and large-area offices in Astro Park are more suited to the employee's work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just renting.
The competent contractor Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central seat with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent airport connection is just as important to global society as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important company within the region led yesterday to the joy of the winners and the disappointments of the defeated.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this succeeded in obtaining a "global player".
It's a fantastic expression of trust in this locality.
Fujitsu is probably going to town, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Mayor Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed in good time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the companies," said Korwis.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Square.
The result was decisive economic reasons.
Now it's about preventing a long stay in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house in Rathaus-măšta, which has been used so far by Fujitsu, and the neighboring "Small Verticale" were among the most controversial construction purposes of the spa town, along with other buildings in Marienbader-măštačta ten years ago.
Between the station and the councillors there was a joint project of the city and a private designer called urban entrance, which was criticised, however, for the massive building of the area that had previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, a company of investment advice and rating Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujits, who was still connected to Siemens, moved home.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 together by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Groupe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after the year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the area of Rýn and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest employees in Fujits are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, another subsidiary of Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the star base, which is twenty years old, which is also the central link of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon disables server - threats to Assangem
Wikileaks gets into tights.
The Amazon Internet service turned off on its detection platform servers.
It is possible that this was the result of political pressure after the publication of secret diplomatic statements.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly detained in the United Kingdom.
Wikileaks, the discovery platform, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now searching for a home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, which is listed by Interpol, is to be held back according to a newspaper contribution in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free", activists announced the publication of short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
The Amazon Internet company recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic posters to manage a high number of access to documents.
With the help of Twitter services, Wikileaks explained this step: "Okay - our dollars are now losing by hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators conducted the search, published CNN television stations on the basis of information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon boycott, informed the British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for a platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is one of the illegal, cruel and regardless of what our national security is about to pose a threat to life on the planet," said a statement by the non-participating senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, which is searched by the Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always identified the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Speakers Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even challenges to the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will still be hiding.
Hrafnsson must have responded to the predictions of North America.
In America, former Republican Governor Arkansas asked Mike Huckabee to be the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks for the treason of the accused and corrected.
In Canada, he said on television that one of the heads of government Stephen Harper - quite ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
In the meantime, she broke up between the White House and Assange's verbal gunfire.
US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughing and absurd" that Assange requested the resignation of the foreign minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for the recently published spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in one person's opinion on websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Commissioner was appointed as the representative of the director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary reform in the structure", which is necessary after publishing news from the mission to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the foreign ministry Philip Crowley.
"We're prepared to protect them, if it's necessary."
Ice-cream university
The "Gelato University" at Bologna prepares frozen sugars for a better annual period.
The basic course for future ice creamers, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatier, a somewhat old ice creamer in Czech, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelatio puts out a ice cream pan out of the refrigerator, puts it in the counter and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to find out more about the ice cream, he won't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he created a ice cream machine manufacturer at the University of Frozen to match the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts for three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, a number of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice are also offered in your own ice cream.
Someone wants to pursue a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, someone dares to have a thin ice of their vague complaints.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all over the world - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of Ice-Cream industry in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a freezer in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman in Julia's house came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master-Galierre Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The determining factor is not only good taste, but also softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training at the South and the Pancake at the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a noticeable dose of romance."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic premixtures of milk, whey, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything with an electronic program of 85 degrees and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine with a hook and runs out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milky ice cream.
Immediately, the teacher is asleep with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment?
Luciano warns, let the spirit of the times go to the unknown.
Who is talking about ice cream "only from natural resources", apparently also used stabilisers - most natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will hit and the customer itself will freeze.
Certain variations of the substance are permitted.
It'll be more stressful with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sugar department.
Besides, there are powders and creams.
"The suppliers will try to impress you with a lot of aromatized spices."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream from the white basic substance, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as a basis for an inhaled chocolate test.
Now he's allowed to participate in ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liscoir ice creams - either with eggs or without them in basic material, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural seasonings.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruity types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruity pyrée - given the taste it is not always better.
Liskoorice ice cream doesn't have to taste more urea when it contains more lice nuts.
The most popular ice cream from kiwi is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture lifts the proper taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a purely numerical task: If broccoli is used with a lot of sugar, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
The lemon ice cream needs extra sugar.
Luciano outputs a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (vinekeepers measure the must from the grapes).
The luck tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much body gear as it used to.
It does not only help the machine for the automatic manufacture of the basic material.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream into the cream and cools down to the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we won't avoid small accidents.
Brazil's Gustavo's going to spit himself out and his colleagues are going down the fruit pear when he's out of control by a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like that happens."
Reviewers in the Double Light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is linked to an industry that experimentes with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts from Test Biotech, who are considered to be an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a glass theory, but we've documented it well," said Christoph Then on Wednesday at the Munich Chief of Test Biotech.
The EFS expert groups for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFS experts have already had a contract with the lobbyists of Ilsi for several years.
This one is funded by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has a decisive role to play in the control of EFSA for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The EFTA rules are in line with all paragraphs of the Ilsi documents and carry a manuscript of the industry which should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's already the second thing that the Testbiotics point to a conflict of interest.
A high manager from Ephesus recently moved without additions or transitional time to the Swiss AG Syngent - and changed the parties.
The announcement for Central Germany (MDR) also revealed the recent personal connection of the EU Office for Industrial Lobby Control, which aroused interest both in the Ministry of Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efs can't recognize the meeting of interests.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. those from the industry, if they are highly skilled, is mentioned in one statement.
Experts working for Efs are not required to have contacts with industry.
But they have to be filed.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILS) in the United States.
It is only designated as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the estimation of the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at the present time genetically modified plants are allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that there is no reaction of genetic plants to the effects of the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, will do genetically modified corn in the field," says Then.
The current practice is simply to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which cannot be reliable.
"If they are not looking for a risk, how could they be found?" she asked the plaintiff Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientific workshop has been studying genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Curych.
In this area industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe as well as in the US.
That's why there are almost no scientists who wouldn't be connected to the group anymore.
Most people don't publish studies that are critical to companies.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
Stone level
Uli Gsell also made some arrangements, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September the trunks came and began to shake a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands protested against the S21, a billion-dollar decline in the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were in trouble.
Broken to 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Wheat from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a shoemaker in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
You've secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't go away."
It goes, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The foot of stones from Stuttgart leads to the woods at Tübingen on the former deposion of the French army's munitions, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the things that came up during a storm in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they broke down on the lock or disappeared on the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden stand that was a former housekeeper.
They told him that he was being handed over and threatened when in September all the papers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that is running a demo.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about it.
And when it happens, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms a heavy block, a price of between 6.50 and 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that they will return it when the reconstruction takes place.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes, the cost of 25 large trucks.
I guess half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold a long time.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all over the corner and pulled back what came into the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long turned into "walls" or as the edges of the shoots with herbs.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political allotment."
He sits in his field car and rides for his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, stopped studying, later biology, then took an interest in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of rocks stored.
He's cutting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's a mess.
There are artificially worked sand dunes in the snow.
"One of them belonged to the Marien Bridge in the Draždjanes," he says.
The sand from the labyrinth, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up through the woods.
It shows on the pile: red sand, first part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Come on.
"Nice travertine."
One day, they belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannsstatt-travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of St. Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what a move, what a move.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were smashed and transported by simple gladiatorial and wheeled vehicles before, he becomes quite respectful.
"It'd be a scandal if something like that broke."
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
But today, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, the stonemakers, one carpenter, one tailor, one glass, and one gardener settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says one who assesses the remains.
He has to go to Colin at the time.
There will also save the stones.
Fighting talent about High-potentials
There's a lot of people at the pollination.
16 students are pressed for salmon bread, tomatoes and sweets.
Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the VW developers here are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and by the way, to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to compete for the smartest heads, as well as VW, succeed and work in cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most promising graduates in the audiences, before they get to the labour market and others will be interested in them.
As universities do not publish any lists of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to get talent the second day.
One young lady from the personal department is delivering prescriptions, rubber bears and VW logo plates.
He will tell the promising young talent about practical programs, student jobs and point them on their way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would fit as a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, there was a major technical project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies can no longer choose their employees from long-term clients.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to exert a particularly highly qualified workforce.
In particular, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German VDI Engineer Association, 40,000 unoccupied engineering positions remained in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the lack of engineers is still growing.
The KPMG's audit and advisory firm is headed for Roman Dykta's talent hunt.
It organises demanding Recruiting-Events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants have to find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send this eight promising students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can visit KPMG branches and meet with the company.
He'll decide in two pick-up wheels who's gonna take part.
Only Creme de la Creme from many interested parties will fly to the United States.
In the struggle for High Potentials at universities they will pay according to the Dykta's ever harder laws.
"We want to make a difference with our race."
"The simple journey on the sidewalk was too small for us."
It looks like a Dykta talent hunter's lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants like this last year."
"Some will soon finish their studies and plan to miss work," he says.
In addition to direct reference to the campus, the small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the trade fairs."
"As in Intersolar," says Sith Stube, head of the personnel department of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company from Bonn employs some 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently 35 posts are posted on the company's website.
"At the moment it's just complicated to occupy free space."
"It's worth a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company strives to enjoy other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Great groups can't offer it often," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
They don't play a major role in finding a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good treatment options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld occupied one study of the Institute's Great Place to Work 55th place among 100 top employees in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employees.
In addition, collaborators are asked how they are satisfied with their work and the working environment and follow the framework conditions of employees.
The Head of the Personnel Department of Stübe hopes that her location will bring her points to the job seekers.
"I believe that stakeholders are especially informed of the external assessments of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through your own employees," he says.
It is called the Internal Employer Branding, i.e. the placement of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"The satisfaction of employees is the best envoys."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they'll do their own advertising to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a tie game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil gardens
During the following years, there will be no new oil gardens on the coast of the state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus annulled the previous plan with its final validity.
New gardens are banned before the Atlantic coast as well.
Minister Ken Salazar told us on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should pay for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this accident, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure on the opposition and industry of his will to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
This will reduce the dependence of the United States on the supply of oil from abroad.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the destructive oil spill in the oil tank.
The focus of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of requests.
The investigation commission commissioned by Obama should submit the results during December.
In October, the minister inside Ken Salazar cancelled the ban on rotation which he paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, different oil groups applied for new garden purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster by stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At the present time, the control authority is reforming itself in principle, which has noted many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would abolish the lucrative option of tax exemptions for oil and gas groups.
The industry is now openly warning that more stringent regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry," the current research in the area of the BDO consulting firm is the result of a ban on turning on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance still complains about uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation is going to change."
Investments in new draw-off projects are shifted to the point of withdrawal - at the rate of growth.
The area of Ogoni was burned
The water in the rivers is oily, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of unique oils have destroyed nature in Ogoni, Nigeria.
People are living with stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't fall for it," says the environmental activist journalist: "Today you'll get enough oil.
The 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy floating around the chest of water that surrounds the smurf: the scene works in the water peach with spirits almost to the beauty.
It's not visible that under the surface of the blue sands of the oil spills.
Earlier here she was collecting enough shrimp into the dishes, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti river.
In the meantime, slowly pouring water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large quantity of oil was poured into the huge wet area from the fragmented management.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must fall for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, which is in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the highest marine areas in the world.
The road along the river through the mangrove bays with many side streams is just a considerable whole range of bays.
The engine on the ship cooks instead of light water with a teddy bear, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves range from the ground to the black spots of the doctor, rarely the emerging palm leaves their leaves hanging sadly.
We are looking for a bunch of birds that usually occur in wet areas: Once the engine is shut down on the boat, it will spread into the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, scary silence.
"What is being played here is the ecological management of the war," says sadly Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first producers from Europe were included here, in the 1980s, the first resistance was formed with the later reformed author Ken Sara-Wiwa, where the Shell group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was extremely dangerous for the employees.
To date, the company must not return to Ogoni: while it weighs daily from the whole area of the delta of the three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 attractive gardens and 7,000 kilometres of management of more than two million barrels of black gold, oil fields in Ogoni lake lie in the group area, the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred meters is covered with the steel structure of the water as a bizarre soybean: "Christmas Trees", so they are called very gently the heads of garden openings.
They're 50 years old, most of them to the sea.
Every moment such a head of the garden will break, Akkobari tells, and then the constant flow of oil will flow into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres of oil have been found in the delta: every year, the amount of oil that has flowed to the sea in Alaska during the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the ongoing ecological disaster.
While Shell Group marks sabotage and organized oil theft by more than 90 per cent of pollution, environmentalists talk about the thorny heads of gardens and rough roads as the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is usual in the world, according to US scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the amount of conductal disorders is "somewhere higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance as abandoned, oil-poored workshop under the broad sky, it emerges from the mangroves of the character: they are completely nascillated and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of many of the courts, which are partly linked by management, partly freely scattered across the country, fire is burning: illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in the courthouse over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
It flows from the lead to the catch-up heap of petrol, later cape at the end of the drive of kerosene and finally of oil.
In this way Michael and his four associates produce up to four courts a day for 300 litres: "We're going to make 34,000 Naira" -- about $22.
The residents of the delta use the chronic shortage of nutrients in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be broken by illegal producers: because they have raw materials free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers", who connect to management everywhere in Ogoni: according to experts, the whole area of the Niger River delta is losing at least 16 million liters of oil a day.
But only a relatively small part of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally destroyed: the largest share will be filled by organised criminal networks, to which the policies and high status of military representatives should be added to the tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate on whether the people and their efforts or the lax way of production caused the disaster is considered purely academic by Akpobari activist.
"If the oil companies were not considered to be spies and if they did not completely destroy the vitality of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refining."
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so corrupt that it only seems to go away from the group: "Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better."
Michael's gonna get upset.
"The highest time to disappear," says the welded manufacturer.
"Sometimes soldiers can come."
If they were found by a special military unit, they would not be threatened by prison, but by a painful payment.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects down to the bottom," says Akpobari.
Investigators detected a dangerous construction failure in A380 engines
A380 clearly has a major security problem.
Investigators have found a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastropheal engine crash" when they were looking at a machine that was forced to stop.
The airline Qantas wants to complain about the engine manufacturer.
Travelers on the Qantas airbus were likely more fortunate at the beginning of November: the Australian Air Safety Agency found a major safety defect on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations, and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
Perhaps the problem would have serious consequences: on one oil connection, there could be shocks due to consumption, reported this Thursday in a public statement by the ATSB.
This fact could lead to a "disasterous engine accident".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is also the airbus of Qantas, which had to arrive urgently on November 4th in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided justification for the claim before the Australian Social Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against this company.
The chief of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the wear surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to the oil burning.
After this event, up to 40 engines will have to be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with large aircraft equipped with the engines concerned.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesperson for ATSB Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiencies were considered to be important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-foot aircraft is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Total snow is causing chaos in transport
The whole of Germany in white: almost all of the country snowed overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, train and aircraft connections are broken.
At least three people died in transport accidents.
The winter is freezing Germany: almost the whole Republic fell on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow - which leads to many places to transport chaos.
It lies in some places in the north and in the east up to 15 centimeters of snow.
There is a very limited transport on several roads and many roads.
At A7 at Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it was not able to handle the new snow.
There was still a strong storm wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea coast of Šlesvik-Holštýnsk awaits an afternoon stormy landing with a water condition of 1.2 metres above normal.
The snowflakes in Saska caused major problems on highways and highways.
According to the centre of the bad weather Meteomedia was therefore the highest degree of anxiety in the Saska Switzerland.
Part of it was about 20 inches [30 cm] of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused the waves.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left there last night.
In Saska-Anhaltsk, police authorities also reported major road problems.
A2 caused the wind and snow to slow down and torso.
In Durynsk, there were problems with snow on A4 and A9.
According to Germany, there are major difficulties in Saska, Saska-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the wheels, turned trees on the wheels or broken tops and gaps.
In Saska, a remote operation from Lipska to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Duryn Saalfeld he had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers were taken on a train from firemen and lifeguards waved decks, food and drink.
The snow wind was rolling over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been cancelled for many years.
According to speakers, the information centres for the years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled years.
In Frankfurt nacht Mohan, a 40-year-old spokesperson for Fraport has been cancelled.
The maintenance of the roads is in constant deployment.
Although there are only a few passengers left at the airport without connection, 400 full beds are prepared for them.
There's been accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died at a train crossing in East Holštynsk.
The engineer was slightly hurt.
Because of the snowy road, there was a similar accident near Norimberka: there was also a truck caught on a train ride because the vehicle was tied.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Norimberka remained closed until early hours.
And to that end, a 30-year-old woman died when she returned to Ascharchenburg with her car on a busy road.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light shower, and therefore the wind will rise even when it is light.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea will the swift winds of the vicar's strength.
But it's gonna be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for tower-double buyers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye with its signal: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
The real estate could cost up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters in the group: the tower-twinches in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now, apparently, the financial group wants the cost of renovation back - and is looking for buyers for both nightmares, as "Financial Times Deutschland" informs with a call to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still examining whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then to rent again," he said.
This is where the largest credit institution in Germany surrenders its corporate seat again in a short time.
The Bank took over towering twins only in the mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of its own fund and subsequently refurbished them in a cost-effective manner.
Energy conversion is estimated to be around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Experts from the field estimate, according to the newspaper text, the value between the named towers at the price of around €500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of pits for dead miners
More than 10,000 people buried the memory of buried miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions down there.
It has still not been possible to release the dead, because the safety situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago there was a strong explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners from 17 to 62 years old were wrapped down.
In the shaft where the accident occurred, the probe was dropped, but there was no trace of life.
Because of the high concentrations of poisonous gases and the following explosions, the rescue forces were not able to break down due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts came up with the fact that miners no longer have any chance of survival.
He still hasn't been able to free the dead.
Now the memory of dead relatives and friends has been treasured.
At Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people were gathered in the sunlight.
They've been silent for two minutes.
To honour the memory of the fallen miners, 29 tables were built, on them helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Pictures and personal things, such as clothing and surfing, have also found their place here.
At the state government buildings, flags were flying halfway through the yard.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would emerge from the "deep land" on the surface again, told the participants of the commemorative event the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown down.
The commemorative event was attended by several foreign diplomats, in addition to the ministerial president and relative victims.
During the 19th November explosion, British and South African miners were also involved.
The rescuers began by firing fire inside the coal bottom on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gas is dissolved, it starts cooling high temperatures down, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is there a horror about an art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to recapture the old border with his battle-exposure "Wallala Rising".
What kind of audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn mean when he was playing Wallhalla Rising?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) will be released from his torturers and killed almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young fans who are looking for blood action, because our hero helps with cruel methods of killing and even the inside of his belly when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, as it is actually called, during the whole film, no word and no other characters speak at least one or two sentences or let themselves fall to the painful dying screams.
Otherwise he is silent and riding in a terriblely beautiful hilly countryside in Scotland, which offers the Viking world scene about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult enthusiasm movies with interest in existentialism and very peaceful camera footage.
It's good if he has more target groups, it's only bad if they get out of each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylish trilogy about the drug dealers "Pusher", is regarded as a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, Stoicically but defending his works to get closer to either the humour of the main stream or the less brutal artistic audience.
Most artists are likely to be distracted by the squeaking brains and interiors.
The proponents of the action films will be exhausted no later than the moment when the Oneook is released for free reason with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and will remain forever in the wind and mire until they are apparently filled with humanity to America and still remain silent.
There's no wonder, then, that in Germany, Wallhalla Rising didn't get into the movies and was now only released on DVD.
It's mainly a pity for beautiful pictures, but it's also because it hides an exciting movie that deserved a little attention for a particular façade, places to collected blood.
This movie isn't about dialogues or exactly events, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a film.
And that's not for a show runaway.
Reef doesn't take him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocate him with his cold pictures and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the undescriptable hatred that comes from the heart.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Ocea leaves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the most one-eyed heroes whose motives are never explained, who become the time for enemies and transitional allies to be a warrior of hell, perhaps a messenger of the Devil.
It's causing damage, but maybe it's only for those infected.
"Wallala Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and wonder.
It's a badge.
Secret land work
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has a new focus on the Syrian secret nuclear programme.
The country, however, is preventing the expression - and it will not allow any control.
Around midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli combat aircraft F-15 I will attack a mysterious quadruple building in Syria.
It stands on the coast of Euphrates; the nearest city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Nuclear Power Agency (IAEA) shall show its name when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this area hidden in the valley turning away from the stream.
On the basis of a communication from the US Foreign Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, was well suited to the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Fifty-year-old technology doesn't match anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unsaturated satellite images.
The computer animation has explained where the components of the reactor could be before destruction is to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, there were still photographs presented showing the building near or even inside.
The reactor was just before the release, but no fuel items yet.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's not known about much more than this time, even the odds have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently published in his memory that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building in an el Kibar reactor, but basically there was no evidence that there was a "active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some of the rapporteur's secret services in Europe are even more careful and speak only of "the alleged reactor", although the CIA's presentation is considered to be "decent".
They're missing clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he has a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer, the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
Although allegedly "unused military buildings" the Syrians were quick to move away and also properly leveled the ground.
In June 2008, however, the IAEA team managed to locate former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the al-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received via the Member State satellite photos of commercial sellers from the time just after the attack, which should be more prominent than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these pictures are not on the market, because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps by Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed she never had a secret nuclear program or a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damasek said.
But it turned off the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things - as well as satellite photos.
He also prohibited auditors from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the anxiety of the bombed building.
But Israel is certainly silent, too.
"We will never comment on it," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently.
The investigation of this case has been carried out without delay since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious problem due to the confidentiality of the Office", as the High Western Diplomat at the IEA headquarters in Vienna has acknowledged - it is a serious breach of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty under IAEA supervision.
The IAEA considers the key to further progress in the area of three other devices, which are to be "in a functional connection" with the data reactor - and, unlike it, they still exist.
At the same time, the auditors have not so far indicated what the device is, what its function is, or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung news, the IAEA is designated internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandaryah, driven back to nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on satellite imaging complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely that there is a military base within or close to the military base - for this reason Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three sites.
In Vienna it was reported that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been previously sent to the United States to investigate the military bases.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility's secret service.
The IAEA has the basis and also satellite images of transporting material here and there between these three places and the quarter of the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "documents on sensitive activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
However, where the uranium comes from and where it should later be sprayed with plutonium on the bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the trolleys that could hide important traces are hidden in these three places.
As if they had disappeared from the surface of a hundred pounds of freight vehicles, no one seems to have any information where the net came from.
Only a few kilometres away from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt sink, which had Syria checked in 1998 as an appropriate radioactive waste fund, considers IAEA unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected ground work and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months making a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows the great interest of the auditors.
In the meantime, the lady refused this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why the thing is not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections for several months, which is one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear control office has.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already been talking about "the possibilities to which he is turning in the future", but he still weighs it.
This choice poses a major risk: On the one hand, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is in need, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in scaling.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens when they finally find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working in summer on still unrelenting directorial ingredients, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, about the loving story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
There's much more to know yet - but it's also causing anxiety.
It is said that during the war in Yugoslavia, the Muslim woman fell in love with the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women's teams immediately protested, so the planned film from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but in Bosnia it is still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through the UN-organization to help the refugees of UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not quite diplomatic - it offered women a week before the meeting in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where they were raped, the love stories were unknown, and Jolie's attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the script.
Its organisation therefore recommended to the UN organisation to help refugees to leave Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian informs.
What scene exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read its script, has allowed for minor events in the Sarajevo film - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author stresses that she is not following any political intention in her film that she has made a great effort to wage conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give space to all the parties involved.
Due to its content, it remains uncertain.
There's another version of the movie that sounds really different on the Internet: lovers knew each other before the war started and met each other again when she's like a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's really starting before the war is true.
Jolie suggests that it is under pressure that "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
Now they can release her from Hollywood's hackers: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they've done many times.
Nothing to go away
This evening is good for Ira again.
Not even a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy at the sound of loud music, ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork yesterday, because players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer kennels - and they hit each other.
The "Birth Pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to do so a flight to Las Vegas to the world championship in a beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this so-called beer game and durable computer, it doesn't work very well together.
Still, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to react to a heavy question that brings the future.
His plan is not a playful adventure in Las Vegas, he's going to a New Zealand interview in January.
"I have such a strange feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job."
Yet: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "now she's got her dream job as EventManager, perhaps it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of bad views at home, they've tried their luck abroad for two out of three tanner cousins.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
Boys leave: As with Tanners, it seems in many families on the island.
100 000 Irish leave the country at the time, predicts experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They count even by 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar eviction wave that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of uprising, which brought great prosperity to Iraam, discontent is growing again.
The economic crisis is particularly repulsive for young people, educated Ira, who have so far only experienced a resurrection.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years.
It took everyone, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men are out of work for 30 years.
In the Irish Times there are many letters of readers who complain: "All goes from mountain to hill in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - who can, however, go away and our land loses the whole generation."
"The last one please let it go."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees the future in black, because the government is only cheating and young people are not offering any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but have no strategy to create new jobs," says 20 years old.
He's watching her people move from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organises "WorkingObroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a general service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity, however, to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
He knows what it's like to build something else, six months ago, Sean O'Donovan.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in the building in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he continues to Hannover or to Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan will get rarely at home in the meantime, because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home the rent at home.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," he says, when the first time after a long time exceeds the dust of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm basically not."
He laughs desperately and walks in cold rooms.
A small house is located in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, a large expensive car parked in the driveway.
O'Donovan bought a house together with a sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, the simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
He's afraid it doesn't have to be good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, comes down hot tea and says, "I don't have kids that I have to live and I'm young; even though everything turns out wrong, I can start again."
A construction engineer doesn't like the calls he hears so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on this island," he says.
"When you work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England for the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life flowed back to Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep your future open and just wait for the future to develop elsewhere.
He's been in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there's another thing that worries him enough these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
They're afraid she might turn around for a farewell party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says and drinks a good beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Practices of Democracy
The support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support for private enterprises.
Criminal activity causes greater anxiety than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey that took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, changes in attitudes across the whole area can thus be monitored.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and early October, two related issues prevail.
The first is that Latin America has a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the Pacific Coast in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has risen by 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are democratic convictions, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it was the same number as last year, but compared with 2001 when it was 25%, it was a big increase (Graph 3).
The 34% survey indicated that they trust the snow in their country and 45% trust the government, again it is the same number as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis was undermining democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the world financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only indirectly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the taste changes in a wide spectrum from country to country (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luise Inácia Luly da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the violent crime situation worsened.
Just the second time since the research began, he sees more respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Count 31% says that either they or their close relatives became victims of criminal activity last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of the last year and is also the lowest since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprises and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the whole area say that private enterprises are necessary for development, this percentage grew from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables their countries to develop, this percentage has risen by 47% from last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (as opposed to 18% last year), followed by the United States (as opposed to 9% last year without change) and Venezuela (as opposed to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela is pleased with the success of Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised Selection
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than the outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections meant filling the urns and repeating the vote, voting cards scattered through the channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced for the sake of the ice earthquake, flocked around and tried to find out where they could go.
Some of them finally gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a few pre-supposed predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called after the vote was cancelled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean said carefully that "they do not believe that these inequalities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are binding on René Préval, the unpopular derogating President and his candidate Jude Célestin, shall notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is planned for ice.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former ladies, have resigned from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, it may be a problem if Mr Célestin, who has a small or negligible support between the voters, is appointed by the electoral commission for reaching a decisive fight.
Because of the regular epidemic of hell and more than 1 million people still living in the states after the earthquake, the fears that the election will be low have fueled.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to be elected, but for the sake of disorganization, they were banned.
The 250 thousand identity cards that are necessary for voting remained shortly before the elections were undistributed.
There's a lot in the bet.
Gifts see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear that the Haitians are making this on their own.
After the tips in the center
In the weeks when she was widowed suddenly, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine President, was weighed down with public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, the turning of this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in the elections next year may depend on whether the sad Mrs Fernández abandons the commitment of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has enabled the first couple to lose further income according to their will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split and was further destabilised at the death of Mr. Kirchner for a heart attack on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement of the Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (in which the government had been falsified and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for the next year, with more space for the president to lose according to the liberacy.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about the numbers that are approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who came to the office in 2003, when Argentina was under economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, made it difficult for the private sector and cleaned up the INDIC, a statistical agency that joined in the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now measure this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and the Committee's predecessors.
And her officials say they want to reduce wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy has been supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation has disrupted the growth based on large devaluations in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández has indicated that he wants to renew Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government has established an agreement with the bondholders who previously refused the restructuring of the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now, Madam President Fernández's deal with the faithful governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about 6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted that this reality should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that would remind the introduction to cleaning INDIC.
It is not clear yet whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the functional period when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class who is tired of chirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to give up many of the opinions her husband has held in politics.
Semi-incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a tight bond with the fortress.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those authorized, elected mayors and city councils on 27 November in five urban districts, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail firmly and have been strong in business relations, including agreements on partially free trade, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but just tight.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three out of the five offices of the mayor, she was unable to win most of the votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is more concerned with Taiwan's independence, has gained almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP side was together with KMT in the city councils.
The elections were played as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include loud pick-up trucks and mass assembly with flags with low-fat girls.
Part of it was even a forced secret attempt to murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, honorary President of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the pre-election evening.
A man shot young Mr. Lien out of the barn cleanly across the face, hurt her and killed a viewer.
It was certainly not determined whether the gun was intended to harm Mr. Lien or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, claims that the shooting affected the elections, the suspect falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Probably the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of solidity remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates have compromised plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
So KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also dropped the incitement of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the reality and is aware that China's trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable for most of Taiwan.
From the Government of Beijing, it can be expected that it will continue to make commercial payments, along with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the flock.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a investment protection and medical cooperation summit.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP party has discovered itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on the basis of corruption charges.
The President in 2000-08 was a storm and a stander of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-change, who was standing under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything in its power to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their proceedings can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "confidential alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprising approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this move.
In his statement of intent, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they claimed Taiwan to be a country of their own.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was bad, even at the cross-cutting pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its unfavorability seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
Speaker KMT says he reorganizes his office, as well as local branches.
Strongly advanced proposals for Taiwan's support for friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "a point from which there is no return has already escaped."
Award for Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category best new artist
The speech at the request of the President and the people must be legally noted.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer who President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of Grammy's surprises this year with the best new artist in the category.
Because Spalding's position on the jazz scene has been celebrated since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, but it's in line with Grammy's rules, when the artist should not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and thanks to its carefree vocal style and a keen hand with pop, fun and Latin effects, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent for voters in Gramma who are looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Other jurors of Grammy by law appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, exciting, refreshing album ride, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophoneist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a lovely favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO "Treme" series was rated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise attracted to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lober.
The wild group of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk got a few deserved recognitions in the category of big files, when in competition the chamber jazz Children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the bass player can have free hands as a band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the category of classical music
The classic music nominations at Grammy's 53rd annual prizes have a wide selection of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The lead position in the nomination is Michael Daughterty and his "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among those nominated with a link to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The warehouser living in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate.
The classic music nominations are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, opera, congregational and solo recordings.
The category for the classic music producer of the year is five nominated by Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classic album was nominated by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals project; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the opera category, the nominations are Berg and "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the touch of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovski, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were nominated for instrumental soloist performance with the orchestra.
The writer of L.A. stated that he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin interpretation of Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble with a seat in New York City.
"I wrote it using the Middle East tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony in recording Stravinsk's work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the drummer Paul Jacobs; the housekeeper Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measa Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, Soprano Jesse Norman won the nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mix in Temecule is approved by the planning committee
The planned mix in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of popular public witnessing.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a trade stop.
However, the jury decided Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"I'm as proud of it as an American citizen."
"That means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who oppose, only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The conversation began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly distributed, says Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the web pages of the news.
"There is no America anymore," one comment appeared.
"We are the planet monkeys with Socho Freedoms falling into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centres also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, which took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists were attacked in New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush sentenced the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families joined the Riverside County after the summer without an incident, but desired more and more space than the storage space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new mix of 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take place about 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands space for searching for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has possibilities that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamentalized.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'foreign' life," noted Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online journal Science.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and cheese.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphoration is replaced by fire.
"You are beginning to be surprised at what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this newspaper, published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, caused wide speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements that we consider to be 'standard' does not have to be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because she showed a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are very similar elements, so she thought that a microb that is exposed to both elements could be able to replace each other.
"Arzen is poisoned mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can hardly separate these elements from themselves."
"At least the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work the same as phosphorus. When it gets into the organism, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit rising arsenic concentrations that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the operation of phosphorus, but because they can also survive with substitute arsenic, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or in months where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a specialist in microbiology at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which this reality could be established.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used in earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early days of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four dog shows that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found, and he informed the sheriff of the Los Angeles area on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two sharps and the big pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were found on Wednesday afternoon and two dogs left on Wednesday afternoon, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say where exactly the dogs were found, in which location, however, did not share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught so they could express themselves.
They were very happy when their two acres found themselves in a low-down shelter in Downey in the middle of the afternoon.
The sheriff's agents found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old didi, were unharmed, reported to the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek tribe, who had planned to participate in this week's district competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their announcement late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions planned in days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on almost a month's journey couple after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered in the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the dog boxer, the Parson Russell terrier and the British eagle - who stayed with them in the motel room.
The stocks and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so that the dogs in the car have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would take them to the missing dogs, dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether prices would be awarded.
Lev is ready to yell again now that the restructuring of MGM is finally approved by the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so it could start again.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvency Judge of New York officially blessed the "before the packaged" plan of the creditors to balance about $5 billion of debt and thus clear the way for 86 years of old entertainment that focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US competition order, there are no legal obstacles to MGMs being able to relaunch the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main managers of the simplified study.
The number of employees falls to about 320 out of the initials more than 400.
MGM shall not emerge immediately from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on the planned financial resources enabling a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a connection with an investment bank that needs $75 million itself and funding is expected around half of December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009 when Moelis & Co. was hired by the investment bank to advise management on how to settle its finances, as management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
This August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Director General of Enron, and an expert on rotation known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelise and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study believers took a long time.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that they would sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auctions attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the money that believers demanded.
In the spring of this year everything was back on the drawboard and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the believers at the end of October.
When MGM officially stands out from the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multi-hamilion bonus in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper companies that charge for their services that run the company, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, i.e. "success fee" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew production in MGM, which this year only released one film and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will come out in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, which will be presented by the book "Hobit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, was looking for the possibility of connecting the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not stand out in the agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant contribution to the gift budget.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect costs as much as 10 coral whistles or about 48 plays-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toys salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholeesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technology toys have far more energy, and at the same prices, if not less, than in the past.
While relatively less new toys with associated webs appeared, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkins and Club Penguin, offer more.
Increases the number of toys with button batteries, as well as a toy with battery chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All these prices are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, since 3 years old) are an animal that sings when you push their belly.
At one compression, the animal produces a tone and the other compression begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: As soon as you start playing, you can't stop.
The best choice in song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed 14-inch animation doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also take a month's walk thanks to its innovative block footing.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, even though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child in the '80s, maybe you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a bag full of quiz cards that are designed to make the car turn into a fun with work with self-corrected, funny work jacket.
If you send a smartphone for your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective training as Leafster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first major change in the Leapster series from Leaffrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$ for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to launch games and e-books and has a slot on SD card that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years old) is a file of five cubes, which are not larger than a box of cartridges, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by putting the cubes in a row before the time runs out; it is great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webkins and Club Penguin players were represented in the casinos.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will receive enough credit in the Club Penguin store on any two items.
That might include a wheelchair or a Puffle animal.
About something a little bigger than your toothbrush card is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest of a number of microbots on a button battery.
Brook is moving fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun when you do the puzzles from the cubes and watch if he can find his way out.
He's also very strong.
This one of us was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time under the pressure of our dog.
Introduction of more subtle police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to the square, carefully checked his orders and issued orders with a military authority.
He wanted the women - the Chinese state-run city councillors, feared and ridiculed for their harsh actions and violence - to convey a certain impression on the noise of those around them.
"Stand straight!"
Hurry up!
Show them, they whisper, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive caps and pants were put on notice.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as a line.
Four head coverings perfectly sit on the hair that are perfectly bound by blue and white feathers.
"I personally think they look average," Mr. Tang said outspokenly.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new branches to have higher education.
The Guangdong province has changed the grey-green uniforms into apparently more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the negative views of the strong weaponry: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers surrounded the tankers in an impeccable manner and looked at the owners when the retailer packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his city police with 13 women who have been selected specifically from his perspective, proportionality and youth.
The aim is to show a more subtle, women's side, in addition to the hard side of the police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to promote a city statement, to punish and other administrative measures.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei killed an unaccompanied viewer after using his cell phone to film as they began in protest against the riot.
Last year there was police training in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual there was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without blood marks.
This year a underground melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered left-brain injuries.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese policemen attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan scared the government," China's national edition, called last year after another discussion about tactics.
There was "a really thorough cleaning on the paper."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After announcing the interest of eight new women police officers in October, the head of The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real obligations or were just being distracted.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The district demanded women from 18 to 22 years of age with a good attitude and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adjectives should have a height higher than the average - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
The 26-year-old staff is required.
Officials claim that work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one leading police officer on Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"Candidates must first prove the external qualities, which then determine the other, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes a series of character and inner quality.
Women are like flower vases, he said and added, "Besides being bound, they'll also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management of the temporary city, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the requirements on height are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like the demand for balanced facial features.
Which means that the issue of good judgment is the subject of discussion between China.
Health impairment or freezing is certainly not applicable.
"You can't allow us to serve a chrome or a rough man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is watching the Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and well-formed mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have sexist roots, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they say, because their career ambitions are greater than just getting traders to the streets where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, a group is standing against more than ten traders running on foot or on wheels and trying to sell as many buttons and a mix of tofu before they are removed.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you many times!" said Miss Xu, when the marketer started running, and for a time left his wheel with the car with the noodles.
Cops describe their duties as more monotonous than forced.
"Every day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in his own free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers have no authority as their male opponents to entertain goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false news about police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were returned or burned.
Xindu has avoided such violence so far.
But peace can only be guaranteed by hardship.
Only two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where policemen were watching that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Cops have played a motorcycle that's been repaired in the hallway instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes' distance from the police station, facing the liquid, with the wheels against the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned to hide his name.
Like female policemen, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and freezing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li.
"Mostly it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have cleared Senator John Ensign of the criminal charge concerning his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Norwegian Republican, faced, and which has, until the time of the scandal, been considered a potential Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair has reached national titles and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigna's office said that it was a decision that followed almost every year after the annual investigation, "for sure was pleased".
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate's ethical commission.
Mr. Ensigna's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that it is not planned to bring further charges against him on this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to speak in this case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton had been employed to lobby for them, so much documents and interviews are being cited.
Since Hampton was a former assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for one year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangements of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, have shown themselves in opposition to the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been published "it has been found that this is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on Senator Ensign, Mr Brand, and other lawyers specialising in ethics, they said that the ministry was careful with regard to political complaints, according to a large number of irregularities, including last year's decision to stop the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of a charge of State opposition.
Federal prosecutors "clearly concealed weapons", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Washington, D.C., a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensigno in this case.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer Mr. Ensign, informed him in the interview that on Monday he was called by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then on the second day, and told him that the ministry had not sought any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team is working with the plaintiff to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in the middle statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had submitted to the State representatives.
"I'm not happy to count the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation of the complaint alone, in which the ethical group alleges that the payment of Ensign Hamptons parents to the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main NGO that had been supporting the senator for a long time.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, leading Mr. Ensigna's employees - John Lopez - he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "bussing" into the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another NGO client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When the affair report was first released last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his willmen and resigned to his office as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After several months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign informed reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the Senate's third election period.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the crime of his spokesperson Jennifer Cooper said that the senator hoped that the ethics commission would follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and complete the entire investigation.
" Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his efforts on behalf of the people of Nevad," she said.
Challenge of Cheshire City to Twitter
In a number of court cases, half a dozen of them were written.
A minute later, they sent a report about the terrible testimony on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 reports on Twitter were about rape and child arresting in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, the family, and was to be officially terminated with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayese's lawyers have already filed appeals and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extended use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circular atmosphere" and this expanded, immediate disclosure of information with exorbitant details then introduced the jury when it decided to influence the opinion of the public.
This claim might cause the judge to question whether new technologies also require new rules in court.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the judiciary affects the rights of the fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ulllmann, chief defender of Mr Hayes.
The judge of the Jon C. Blue Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claim regarding the outcome of last week and the fact that the means of communication were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to show that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
Over the decades, the Court has recognised that a report on known cases may raise questions about the fairness of the proceedings.
In the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court's judgment of Cleveland's chiropract, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, "the carnival atmosphere" was the subject of the media proceedings.
Some people are convinced that this crime was an inspirational TV show and the movie "Awake."
Some lawyers said that the appeal of Hayes's half-century judgment could be surprised at the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine a way of communicating from the courts, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for fear of the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, legal professor Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done voluntarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restrictions on direct communication from the courts may make the process more fair.
The case of Twitter is only one of many alleged lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the judgment.
Defenders also claim, for example, that in the case of Mr Hayes, he could be pre-connected when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them a criminal photo of the threat when choosing the jury.
Some of the jury members claimed that they were scared of the photos of the victim that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defendants claim that they will also reject the death penalty and claim that the judge misapplied a jury that was critical of the representatives of the state and that by his decision he wrongly placed greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments about the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict raised last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly exhaling the flames of emotions in this case.
"The daily attack on the media, the cameras and the reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that has not been seen in New Haven so far, and it may also be a state-of-the-art rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some journalists claimed that the immediate reporting was more exhilarating than the later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should be in charge of other processes.
However, some lawyers have demanded the appeal of courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayese's lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in Dr. Sheppard's case, because of the wide range of action and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can courtiness overcome failure?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its aggressiveness and negativity, a small amount of courtroom appeared this week in Washington.
Is this the first real partnership of the two political parties or just an illusional moment before a quick return to the battle of the side in the capital?
The morning meeting of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any major findings on the main topics to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, there was a fair discussion on the differences of views between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of the page.
The Central Public Meeting of the President of the Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close coexistence has for several months built mutual respect, which surpasses the ideological failure that members continue to divide.
And it is quite difficult to say that the new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the trial period - examining each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the willingness to tolerate the renewed war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation of the participants were also conducted with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed in the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least fast.
"There is no question whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable by choice.
The elections stirred up the emotions of the parties and then they calmed down.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bus's tax reduction at the end of the year has faded and nobody considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, and that is permanent or temporary.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment rates only because Republicans cannot look at how they support tax reductions for the property while refusing to support unemployment for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's debate in the White House, it is already possible to see greater optimism regarding the agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112nd Congress calls for ice.
Rather, it is likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that must be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is to a large extent widespread - that courtiness will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between today and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reason is largely related to the creation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the election of tea parties that helped create it.
Republican leaders are now facing the danger of enlargement, know that they must act in accordance with their promises and reduce government spending and abolish the new health care law.
These attachment lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on deficits, which include reform of the tax law and the increase in certain taxes, increase in the pension age and decrease in expenditure.
Social Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to put pressure on the issue of the deficit to the public programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th committee in order to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close as possible to this number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the jury who propose that, in the case of financial matters, we have, at least today, small foundations or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary republicans.
The first year begins next year in the form of party conflicts, when the Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, tax and health care, when the period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's causing the move?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the pageant in the last elections, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be directed to the pat, as it was in 1995, then both sides will follow the public response very carefully.
Anyone will be threatened by a reduction in votes, will probably change the course and will seek compromise.
It could be an optimistic view of the matter.
The laterality and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-19th century, and it appears that there has been a greater ideological failure between Obama and the parliamentary republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a foreplay for the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the court that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it's going to be a lot of effort on both sides to find common bases on issues that they still divide.
An American document looks Moscow as a safe haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of "kleptocracy", and it continues to be part of the fees and charges for the protection that come to Kremlin, a US embassy in Russia took place in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service have a large number of protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - will take his own when the money starts to move up the edge.
The record that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record shall be based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accused her of much corruption.
He was revoked in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have been constantly supporting corruption charges for many years, and have won several charges of guilty charges for such charges.
In September, he said to the Russian television station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will appear on the vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details expressed in such a way, which is in the ambassadorial report, and it is also unheard of that would make diplomats from foreign countries.
"The Moscow City Government and its association with criminal animals have led some to call it 'disfunctioning,' and confirm that the government acts more as a cleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'cover' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the State Representative's office, as well as all over Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"Analytics identified and tripled structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"Federal Security Service, Ministry of the Interior and the militia are at second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "traders in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (better than organised criminal groups), as they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself may already have problems; even those who pay may sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough, their trades are closed under different locks.
The bear talked several times about fighting corruption, but he admitted that he made little progress.
The ambassador's report is about the men taking the suitcases, probably rushing cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucracy," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Inde.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class, because there are no political classes in Russia."
No politicians, no opposition, no power division, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption is worth more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by non-governmental organisations of Transparency International (the country is ranked from at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the report of the US Embassy, which appeared in Moscow in late evening hours, certainly did not provoke the Russian government's enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Moscow's shortcomings can be blamed Luzhkov, it may be the possibility for Kremlin to argue on the problem.
In a conversation with CNN with Larry King, Putin announced that the documents WikiLeaks published could be false and responded in anger to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is our mutual coexistence, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to deal with the past
In a low-lighted concrete classroom with dirty and demolished walls, the school director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who erected it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sereng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "cutter" for its harshness during the Rudish Khmer government, the commander in this remote country of Rudish Khmer remains popular in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization are still living.
But this year, 12 years after Rudi Khmer's surrender of the governments, the long-lasting loyalty is also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victim of the föru verddy a osmířenní was allowed publicly to confront the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian Court will bring together the first sentence of a former member of the Red Khmer, the judgement of a former leader, a notoriously known violent association Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, there has been a growing tension among the veterans of the Red Khmer in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to reintroduce into Cambodian society.
"Among the former Red Khmers there is fear and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Red Khmers was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Rudish Khmer government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people had been cured or died of hunger, disease or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and defeated the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started the uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running partisan wars from their base in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok was growing up in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1980s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which was capitalized by Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was taken by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangreek in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
They were no longer cared for by their men, most of the former Red Khmer warriors have fallen into the ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them are nostalgic.
Although several elite Red Khmers have held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only a minimum benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raising without any idea of what to do."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"That Mok enjoyed all."
"But life is hard now, because we have to make sure of everything."
The ruling court of the Red Khmer also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Khmer.
The court is to order the commander and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether he will continue in the four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm down the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculations focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Rudish Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was monitoring the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
The last couple of nights, Im Chaem returned from field work to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared over the dry grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she'd refuse to go.
"In Cambodia there will be peace and stability," she said.
"If there's another criminal complaint, there'll be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed away from the Red Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court would search for further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation centre.
"Relationship in Khmer means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre issued the first lecturer approved by the government of the Red Khmer, has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmers, even through the connection of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be sued."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more difficult and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forum, the textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer people here still have a strong spell.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is a path covered with lead and embossed with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a corner of black satins covered with a sharp back roof.
Paul Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the roadside said he didn't know much about the man who was burned at that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea had her birthdays and planned to visit the place of rest by Paul Pot, where she would bring a bond of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that its weapons stocks are based on uranium
In a surprising victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are surrendering their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sergey Martyn.
After the summer, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit the rock of the uranium last spring.
But the U.S. officials said that in the last two months, a few hidden operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the middle agreement to remove the residue of material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was founded.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a major, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would provide all sensitive nuclear materials all over the world for four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all its highly enriched uranium stocks.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for George W. Bush's administration.
In the days of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity...we're not gonna make dirty bombs and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarus's uranium in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily lit, officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out on a plane, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the programme, most of which on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institution, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was co-ordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, the head of the Energy Ministry working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Study this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, endeavour to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, especially due to the cruel repression of human rights by Lukashenko.
But the middle statement indicates the possibility of gradual sneezing.
"We welcome progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations, and this is necessary for the progress of the country and its inhabitants," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do with the CIA's jets
The Spanish government did not make any valuables with regard to the CIA flights to the Taliban and Al-Qaida members in Guantanam across the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said on his telegram.
This is the result of documents provided by the Wikileaks server in El País, where it is also written that then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Veg asked for information from the Spanish executive and "could show that he has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a statement by the Council of Europe in which tens of States, including Spain, were accused of participating in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Veg.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "deprived Zapatero the government of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain does not have a problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"But they only want to be informed," said Aguirre in one of the documents, so that they are not "contained unprepared."
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the US Ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but that this matter was in the hands of judges had a cabinet with limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, it was not intended to block the judge's initiative to request the disclosure of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence for CIA Flights.
"This information does not contain any criminalised file or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after consultation with the Prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed concern rather about "the clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the disclosure of CNI information or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 on the occasion of the lunch of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, this ambassador told that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they will consider appropriate", he has already instructed his collaborators "to avoid extended comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party's negotiations on this matter (PP; Czech People's Party - late).
"Even with its general proameric orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even in the event that this disclosure might have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Admitted mother-in-law complained online about mother's "old age"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after Galician."
Monica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname that she had used since recently, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know a woman’s emotional life, which the journal ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into relations with industrialist Ivan Tunes in 1998.
They've been together for a year.
Shortly after the divorce, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You recently found a new acquaintance.
Her choice was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
The little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, she stayed with her little partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, from the content of her communication it is evident that the relationship has broken up.
In March 2008, he is alone at Menorce and writes, "Alberto is kind of angry that I went to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with a little all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address I need to send you."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a little boy with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
In May, he speaks of his return to his place of residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until 19, because I have to go for 20 jobs so I don't miss the place."
She explains that if everything goes well, she'll take her son to her place.
"He will be with whom he should be with me, that is, with me, and he will never again in his life, that I should leave him with someone other than my mother," doubting intent in view of her bad relations.
There's another contribution in July.
When this report comes out, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month and was probably killed 10 is already dead.
"César's satisfied on one side, but he's not satisfied on the other."
"He's with me on the one hand, and he likes it pretty much here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He'll go to summer school, and then I'll save some money for the kid."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big mouth from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what kind of video he sent you on the e-mail, look how he wants it, he's meeting me, he needs sex."
Thirty-third next report: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Victor, the current partner, "He's giving me the money."
Monique's contributions on the blogs dedicated to animes and manes are on the Internet.
She even had her own at MySpace, now audited where she let herself be called "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Teror after motto."
The last man to live with, the guard, expresses his pity and he feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Monica entered the provincial hospital in Palma last night, where she came from the center of communication in Menorce.
Defender, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant doesn't remember how everything happened and "that she didn't mean to hurt a little."
Before that, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bath and had stored his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 chairs and PSC (Socialist Party of Catalan - late translation) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of November 28th, the PP may have the main word on the councillors in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes obtained and the number of experienced Members during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lid's Party of Catalan - late) already has a given idea of the general elections, whether or not there is an increase, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such opposite to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while in the 2006 elections, this number was only 316.222.
Last week, she received a PPC (Lid page Catalan) 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend was maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could obtain 12 MPs against the current 8th party (Convergencia and Union, Czech Choda and the Union - later translated) in the House, and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has a key role to play in PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this people's analysis, the Party of the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalan - late resolution) would have lost one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (Greens for Catalan - late resolution) would still have one mandate, if any, would have another one.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where people may also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the most expected budget administrations - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and peoples agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose its employees in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérid and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive the majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the parties ERC and ICV.
Given the debate of the Republicans, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's representation - as there is a need to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérid and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a key role in the rotation of Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP side before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also won other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, PP has a representation at 34 councillors in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided Al-Qaida with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian detained agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand that established travel passports to various Al-Qaeda groups, including "Tigri of the Liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the other group was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, sets itself the goal of ensuring, by means of "operation Campai", the weakening of Al-Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that this cell was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand during two years when it was active in Catalan, where they were then smuggled and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel freely across Europe and other Western countries.
This fragmented cell was not the only active one with a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore these investigations besides Thai services were also attended by other European police units, and it cannot therefore be excluded that in the following days there will be no similar attacks in other European countries, as in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, with Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men who were driving a cell from Bangkok living in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was abolished in 2009, has in particular stolen tourist passports that met the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, must have been valid for several years and must have been without designated visas.
The investigation documents emphasize that no fact is known so far that it would link those detained from Catalonia with the Bombay assassination, although the author of these attacks, Lashkar-e-Thaiba, should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, a transfer agency in Catalan was sent to buy tickets to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" who killed 106 people.
The police have already had a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Lid Party of Catalan) Alicia Sánchezová-Camach yesterday had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mass his conditions for which he is willing to support his introduction into the role of President of the Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and deny ventures such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists intends to propose during his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party moved to a meeting with Arthur Mass with 18 seats in the elections last week, which is more than satisfactory for gaining a degree, so the candidate CiU needs at least one of the forming oppositions to abstain from voting on his arrival at the office.
The possible agreement with the PP will depend on future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain when general elections are held, but the discussions that are taking place in these days with the remnant of political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for President PP, in order to get her support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the top and free speeches", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of Basque - which the leader of the CiU even wanted to put to the vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the overdue political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the Mas's introduction to the function will be dealt with within the framework of the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herreou (ICV) and today he meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidarita Catalana).
The director of the geriatric device shall ensure that there has been no death as a result of the lack of measures.
The performance of the Lolot Centre does not exclude that their guardian killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to determine the damage caused by the criminal behaviour institution Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while he was employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in care.
The director of this home for seniors Joan Sala came along with a lawyer, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "by wanting the home of La Caritat, it would be possible to bring charges against the culprit" to the responsible for the murder, but "the legality and liability obliges us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not discovered the criminal activities of the guardian in time, the great threat to La Caritat's home is now the claims for substantial compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the remaining families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had occurred in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients at home for seniors, with the suspicion that in many cases he did not see a dead doctor personally, but that, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything was on the phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any case be the cause of what happened".
Legal representative La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party would be allowed to make any doubt except for his own accused person".
The man now nicknamed "The Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and stated that the first crime was admitted on 29 August 2009 and killed the second elder in a month and a half later.
In this case, death resulted in too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used the combination of tranquilizers.
Director La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases of the ninth measure that this caregiver used to kill patients in an attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses that are currently being conducted in the lab should show whether Villa is not looking really for her first victim less cruel death or he killed her by using a loon, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat they do not believe in a medical claim and do not exclude that the number of people killed may be higher than the number he confessed to, and justify his conduct in the various versions that he gave to the Court of Justice, knowing that he must change his conduct when it turned out that he killed eight people.
They therefore say that they want justice to be available so that the entire scope of this matter can be clarified.
The European Central Bank is threatening
The investors responded to yesterday's threat by the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who pointed out that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The territorial differentials have been closed by force and the European Bank's shares have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the non-liquid market, which, although it is declining, recovers - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take some time before he loses his fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank was urging us to bring the liquidity back today, and tomorrow we will have to withdraw the quarter for two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan for the redemption of state debt for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all exceptional liquidity levels within the deadline and the unrestricted access for one week only.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level to predict "minimumly in March" and to comply with a three-month tender with an unlimited approach to the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue in their debt purchase programme and that they will even announce its intensifying.
If the created expectation does not meet, it will re-establish the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue blindly to decrease the level of liquidity, God is with us!
It was the same at a meeting in May, where they claimed they didn't even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and sustainable.
In May, she announced it on Monday, and on Wednesday, she announced that she had already bought a lot of them, causing further distortion of the market.
Yesterday's auction for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in the mood in the market, which Trichet said.
In Ireland, the figures represent losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, are likely to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after no stress tests have been detected in July, the amounts are acceptable within the framework of the aid plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to obtain approval by Parliament of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so there will still be uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel reduced the tone of her speech to relieve tension in the face of the next EU summit held on 14 December, which calls for a political compromise that would show that we are the Union and that we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others prefer Beethoven's Od for joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Tricheta and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Banks was rapid and convincing - we are looking forward to the effect of surprise.
Today, we have a three-year credit bid that will benefit from the effect of Trichet, so we hope that a great demand will be made for it, which will help to resolve our doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain to sacrifice itself.
They would give us cash we don't need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times as much as in March - high rates and market access would close our son die.
However, it is still necessary to use Caesar's wife's strategy - "not to be that way, but to appear so".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack Vega Sicilia's negotiations requested by his children
The storms in the open conflict in the family of the Alvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, are impenetrable.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he has deemed it "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro scheduled for 16 this month and required by five of his seven descendants, who should try to force their majority and empower themselves with the administrative authorities of the prosecution of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesús David and María José, are bringing together a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of the part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not seem to be willing to settle in his dispute about membership in the ruling authorities of the El Enebro group.
of its Administrative Committee was attended by five of its seven descendants, who named themselves the predecessors during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Register of Trade.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth month of this month, which was approved by the official of the Commercial Court of Madrid number 2, restored the caverns in the mud of the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal means that guarantees the appeal of the Commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pabla, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Alvarez of the Alvarez Mezquirizs considers David Alvarez as "a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of the judiciary and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the 18 January negotiations which were totally invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "very insignificant".
The sole protagonists who discreetly silenced themselves have tried without success to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, owns seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the group is required by family protocols to use 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when the issue of the judicial attack is being re-examined. The date of this re-trial has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new incoming team, and despite the rising trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the Ferrari Fernando Alons' triumph.
We would not want to reduce the driving skills of the champion, Germany Sebastian Vettel, or the engine of Renault, who drives his car, in Formula 1 world, was born a legend - a "secret weapon", which the multi-ethnic Siemens put into the hand of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an executive software that simulates the revenues that the German company placed on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software tool, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thereby avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most popular commercial vehicles of the Nissan brand.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software tool has enabled Red Bull team to perform "in a few hours, in almost real time" modifications and improvements that otherwise are detected during race and trial.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to carry out a maximum of three or four improvements during one period.
Today, the Red Bull team is working on 180 highly qualified young professionals equipped with executive information technology who analyze and propose any type of vehicle modification.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles except for the engine that Renault is fully responsible for.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are being modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality into reality for less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of $40 million which represents the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has created about 50 km from London a high-tech race serving the design and manufacture of its racing cars.
These are two buildings where access is limited - especially for journalists.
All that is being played here is considered a "great secret".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero Red Bull is no doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, other protagonists whose aid is invaluable are hidden behind the immeasurable means that the energy label has invested in its participation in the competition circles.
The chief of manufacturing technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the credit of drivers.
Currently this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% success while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP creates its own business in cooperation with local distributors during two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with her trading partner, Pont Reyes, opened her first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of 20 shops in the range of 80 to 100 m2, which this transnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Spanish Vice-President of HP Helena Herrer has set an example of a newly refurbished sale to the Barcelona Gran Vía, belonging to Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has come up with a plan to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, including 20 Spanish shops.
The first shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera didn't want to reveal where other shops will be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP's personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening up businesses will still be the same - with the use of local distributors who have the expertise and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with the exclusive design of equipment sold (with products that can be tested interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing business personnel.
Helena Herrer wanted this to be a franchise, and stressed that the exclusive network was being sold to "improve customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase, service, parental service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the world-wide pioneer programme, which aims to solve any problems with computer devices in guarantee.
Online service is connected to a technical centre of residents in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we'll be able to solve the problems that can otherwise last up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, given that large companies already have the contract service of technical assistance," Helen Herrer pointed out yesterday.
Sabadell bet he'll steal over three years to his competitors a million customers
More optimistic than any other chief, a delegate member of Banco Sabadell's bank council, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will try to compensate for the reduction of bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to succeed in the course of three years with a million private clients.
Sabadell found the way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, is to gain market share by attracting millions of new private customers - 700,000, respectively, if those who leave the bank, if necessary - because up to now the constitution was more flexible for small and medium-sized enterprises and large businesses than for small customers.
This year, 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies have already received the bank.
Its share in the market is 3.5% for private customers, while it is more than 10% for business customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it is also possible to say the same thing, with a view to reducing the costs that the bank will incur when presenting the results during the period.
At this time, few banking institutions are reluctant to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of global banking.
Sabadell this year will close its Optima programme, set four years ago, although originally for three years, but the situation in the markets required an extension for another period.
Customers who leave the shipyard will be their main target group.
At the meeting organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
It is believed that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be prolonged".
In addition, in two or three years 'very difficult to create employment', which is essential for the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is decreasing, the price of mortgages for the risks that banks and brokers pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the prices of loans, which compensates for the reduction of margins.
"The theme of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the rocket yet, but the differentials are very high," said the Guardian.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend in banking "now is a reduction in commissions", but here is a "competitive framework".
The Sabadell strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as a general rule the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not free of charge to ensure that in Spain "there will be a greater demand for sizes".
"There will be no stone left next year," he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "very reduced" and does not exclude certain Spanish institutions from entering red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can market together the collection of funds before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remains a serious problem as some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fusion spore
The Director-General of the CECA refused yesterday that another wave of fusion should occur in the second half of the year and continued at the speed at which the reorganisation of the sector takes place.
When he started the process of association of Spanish supporters, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not involved and waited for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening is the conventions."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this matter," the Director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of ADEA (Association of Heads and Executive Officers of Aragon - p.a.) Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the payments that have appeared in business plans with the Spanish National Bank, not now," he stressed.
"To move from 45 ratios with an average volume of assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus falling in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be in time before the end of the year".
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured Spain that it had the most stringent financial system throughout Europe and "probably" both in the world, and to those who doubt it, he attributed "the lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and the system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and continues to "highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking came very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro but laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension on the markets provoked two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from the reduction of taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokerage agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed people without a dose, until after the privatisation of 49% AENA (Spain airport and flight management - late payment), the managing director of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
With the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, Vice-President Elena Salgadová joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Be told that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future will be, which affects the idea of respecting the old traditions that most of the other members hold.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, but also Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary area.
The second is the return to March - although it can now appear as a ski, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to recast the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary constraints, fines for the guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and by extending the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and it's been defined for some time, so there's no space for the shoots now.
First, when in 2009 the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission caused deficits, the German government withdrew the constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of the dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (tax intensity and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second showed this Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of strong criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published was strongly against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again made clear its position when she called for the reform of the European Union Conventions in such a way as to enable the rescue of a Member State and, at the same time, to require private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and all others.
However, its proposal, although somewhat relaxed, has been approved and we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should enable these measures since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not want to cross.
And he tells all of us that even though we now need to take measures that are not likely to agree too much, this date will end with the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new monetary area in which countries violating the rules will be severely penalised and may be forced to declare the suspension of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany tells us that we need to make a strong path to growth by increasing the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with huge balance of payments gaps, which the governments in the years booming Spanish growth simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst part is, under these conditions, we might be wronging ourselves.
I hope these current turbulences spread more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are given to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood it and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, despite criticism of Merkelov's address, the way of thinking that things should be put in order.
But there's a red line that Germany pulled out, and it doesn't seem to want to move with her.
And from the possibilities to be considered, leaving the euro area cannot be excluded from the full range of serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and enforcement of rules
The Finns who led Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax show no intention of avoiding punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the League of Champions against Ajax on 23 November resulted in the creation of a sea of a record on whether or not this is non-sportable behaviour and whether UEFA should punish both footballers.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) nominated players one after the other deliberately lost their time when they had to play the fool to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next fight against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in its group in the lead - and will be able to continue to the next stage, the saved karet.
Finally, the disciplinary commission of UEFA coach José Mourinh punished two matches and guilty players received a fine.
The challenge of a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is most common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the Etos football, which means rules that are not written, but are followed.
A part of the discussion in this case arose due to the fact that her participant was the Real Madrid team (which boasts of dignity and honor in its gymnasium, and which has already suffered for similar acts by its players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinhem, who thus adds to his long history of the comedian and the provocative another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether or not these facts are subject to the rule of law; it is a matter of action which respects the sport rules, which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of harm such conduct will do to the sports spirit.
One of the characteristics of sports behavior is the physical inability of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, that is, did not come to violent play.
Another of these features that characterize the pure game is to avoid the fact that players have an advantage over the opponent team because of their crime - which has not come here either.
Thus, the paradoxical action of the players in Real Madrid is that what we normally characterise as a rod or a violation of the law did not come to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive punishment.
They're waiting and they're happy to get the punishment.
Another question, however, is what benefit the guilty will have from their deliberate transgression.
It is necessary to note here that the opponent is not in a disadvantaged position and that there is no benefit in the current match, as the obvious result is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another game, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first sight the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this deal, the players will be punished and will move to the second round of cards, in which only one card is sufficient to be excluded from the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it won't be clear if it's an advantage.
In short, and well, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sport, which is part of making a strategic decision that will allow maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, players were not meant to avoid the punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather to choose when to subvert it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running away from the punishment.
Although there is no clear boundary between the type of fraud and the treatment of the rules, I believe that in this case it was clearly a fraud.
It seems to me that there are two reasons for the controversy: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions were transmitted to them from management.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers to organize Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Dictate of the Calendar concentrates this year on reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a rapid event that is threatened by the employees themselves who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
As with the Turkish Med or Lottery, with the coming of December, pre-flight parties are again coming, which are still active as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis they have stopped in the struggle to get customers to lower prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, business questions and associations from this sector agree.
In order to complete the number complexity, he concentrated the calendar this year (when Christmas day fell on Friday) the application for the week from December 13th, which resulted in the reservation on days at the peak (16th and 17th), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As this has happened since 2008, when the dead years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order to avoid abandoning tradition, many employees pay for a loss at parties from their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of pregnancy, the president of the Gremi de Restaurantació de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras, the association of restaurants.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities is not reluctant to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think well before they make a reservation."
"They want to get out, but when it comes to price issues, they're careful," he says.
Trades will go well with those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", says and recalls that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
Research in various facilities shows that the biggest effort for booking applications is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group reports a real boom reservation for this Friday, with the most requirements for losses up to 30 euros, which have been set up by the menu offering total prices ranging from 25 to 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the speciality of this year’s calendar more timely reservations, which has been in effect since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible even to keep prices from last year, and our menu, which everyone should choose, moves from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after they have seen the increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
The sources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a difficult day, as there will be pre-hospital celebrations between friends.
they added to their six group menus Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noted in comparison to last year's guests' trend to lose 10% more exchange for other items such as coffee (Spanish forest wine – late).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which are calling their employees again, and the size of groups seems to be something bigger.
The Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Bar Association, Restaurant and Leisure Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "renewed", even though the clients "contract to the maximum".
This notion did not even come down during the Christmas celebration, so that the payer would point out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has brought about a major unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US embassies in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that provokes the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the explanatory and important details that offer about the content of the communications and ideas of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two States, in terms of nuclear security, is "a step away" instead of an increase, and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not dismantled, but agree on parts to make their destruction easier in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's awakening.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan in one report before visiting the then James Jones National Security Council: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged proliferation of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of nuclear transport".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and with the shooting program is no longer observed only in the United States, but also in Russia, as a growing and leading reason to be monitored.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or shooting programs," said an expert from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jurij Korolev at a meeting with their opponents from the United States.
The latest documentation published by Julian Assange's server is further lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased rate of Pakistani production of these weapons.
"Transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain unanswered or are rejected," said the deposed ambassador in May, who qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a member of the National Reporting Services for South Asia, notes that "and through economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfaq Qayaniho's army chief, that "the Pakistani army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups".
She's head of Wikileaks.
Obama appoints a high-ranking employee responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of facts.
Interpol announced yesterday an "extraordinary challenge", the so-called red note, to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
In addition, the author's legal representative, Wikileaks Mark Stephens, assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was November 20th, when the international police assembly with its seat in French Lyon issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assange "to have a temporary link on it and release it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by a red challenge, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, nevertheless consider the so-called red note to be an enabling arrest - that must be ensured by the national police component - especially where the Member States have a mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
This step has aggravated Assenge's lawyers who published the papers yesterday, declaring that the twenty-nine-year-old founder Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compared to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovic Berijou, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit," says the letter.
While the whole world is looking for it - and his mother from Australia is defending his son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, yet he is not silenced.
On Monday, he provided Skype from an unknown location interview to Time magazine chief - in this interview he demanded the demise of the U.S. foreign minister Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that it was responsible for the U.S. diplomats' order to carry out espionage in the UN and violate international conventions that the United States had signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the press spokesman of the White House Robert Gibbs, who described the demand for demise as "laughing and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should be concerned about the opinion of an individual operating the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has entrusted the high-ranking employee responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The intention of President Barack Obama to stop adding Assange to the importance contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairing the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organisations, "in order to reach and appeal to anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise to help them".
Tom Flanagan, the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisor, went further, saying that Assange should be "killed", which he then had to call back.
"Both should write a reward or use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever will be in the government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, has admitted treason and any punishment other than correction would be too mild," said Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC "drinking" on the trailer of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on its suspension.
Huguet proposes more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe for fighting an already several internal revolution in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican side of Catalan - late afternoon), a result of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture on the demise seems to be insufficient to the supporters of former leader Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovy, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot at all make such concerns as he has had with other inconvenient flows.
That's why Levice's leader is going to try to get new criticisms through a blackout that will help him turn to the general election.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the Committee of State will be able to speak in secret about his suspension in office.
By means of ballot cards, not by raising hands.
If Carod's supporters wish to pass a criminal vote on to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of legal measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid breaking up and detailing his person.
In a few discussions, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half of his votes and one more, but added, without clarifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "by Bulgarian".
The Baroness of Carod demands more from the President than to give his office available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, because Puigcercós controls the largest organ at the meetings.
But since they don't have the majority enough to force the demise, they'll try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
They therefore expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation to be put to the vote of the National Council on 18 May.
Their goal is to support Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise of moving Congress already in the fall of 2011.
Leader ERC stated that "multi-soundness" damages stability and that its goal is to have the organisation able once and for all to wash its dirty clothes behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be a remarkable article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation advisor took the final case that the leader would be confirmed "by a few goals".
And he named them five, two of which are excellent.
The first is "recomposition" executives to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces belonging to the Carod sector.
The second goal could be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC complete the meeting as a functioning mechanism.
And so he fights for state reform so that congresses can be held through the elected delegates.
Termination with the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction at two last sessions.
However, the 2008 meeting decided that the meeting should be considered at a special congress on state reforms.
This issue is still unresolved because the situation inside the party has reflected the solution to this issue.
Now, without emerging critical sectors, it might be appropriate for a moment to deal again with this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the MILENIO Journal, Mexico reported a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, as Milenio reported.
Among the murders are cases of three women and a couple of separated bodies found in Mexico City.
In Mexico, a total of 390 deaths were reported in the previous month, probably associated with organised crime.
Among the cases is the finding of dead bodies in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca period.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a further wound from kindness to the head and had hands and feet strapped with a rope.
The following day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle over the street Mixtecas, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the period Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday 4 November, the companions discovered the body carrying the torture mark and at least three deadly shots into the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the section of the Villa Guerrero period.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50 - year - old man was killed by eight shots after he left his home and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at the age of 30 in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
In Chalco, a dead man was found in a remote path in the El Naranjo colony of men shot in the front, and under the body was found a weapon of calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water canal in the Playa Golondrin colony.
Savings files have been carefully searched for other parts of it, but they have not been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported finding the body with their hands tied to the back and wrapped their heads on the spot of Pena Colorado.
A man had a gunshot wound on his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda during the period Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, there were also reports threatening to death in the victim.
The day later was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony during the period of Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box containing the human head.
in the nearby colony there was a residue of the body packed in a black plastic bag, with a report from El Incorrigible.
Seventeen dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan plant during the period of Ixtapaluca, and the second morning in Huixquilucan was found a dead man packed in a yellowish-blue cloth, which was previously reportedly killed by his body, identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life with two wounds was found in the San Francisco Aquautla settlement.
The female's skin was exposed to the tattoo of the sacred character of Santa Muert (word "Holy Death" - late transclave) and also rings with its image.
At the end of the month, a dead man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by the criminal group was found in the town of Zinacanentepec in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads covered with tape were found and a report was also found in the town of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the victim's case, the report was probably one of the criminal organizations which said, "This will happen to those who do not fit."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying stamps after torture and had tied ends, inside a cab left behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month were found the remains of two men during the periods of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was made and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was packed into black plastic bags, bound with tape and had a message in it; the second one was bored and found in a plastic package in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, they found agents and a report card.
China respects its goal to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 has ensured that its country has made an extraordinary effort to reduce its carbon footprint and has clarified that it will continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % to 45 % by 2020.
China remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he realized that China would not change its goals and would continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including the last approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various multiannual plans have already been completed, financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is said that the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years, has received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also underway, further the project of exchange of light bulbs and the project of reconciliation and adaptation, clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, it is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts with regard to energy use - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the past five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020.
Lawful Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Action Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former President of this Party is entitled to claim from the National Order Commission its right.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the exclusion of Manuel Espiny Barientose has been legalized and that the former President of this party is authorized to address the National Commission and to demand his right.
In a discussion held before the opposition of the Governor of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to address in his case by means of a complaint to the General Commission of the National Council for a decision taken by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the alliance.
Nava Vazquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (allied in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, that was the intention of the local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said that his side is 71 years of dialogue, and that is why "we are not suffering from internal competition, but we are suffering from it and strengthening us", he added.
He said that the committee would be able to choose the best president or president without debate, which the PAN deserves for another three years, so he handed over the staff to the "who the committee determines".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, any one of the five with pride will hand over the Bureau of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future clans, although "not yet time to think for 2012".
"It is now necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent a flag and will be the subject of an observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and claims are inserted into them, and I am sure that Gabina is worthy of those expectations".
When we asked her about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutionale, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, see footnote) for his statements within four years that he is ruling, César Nava called on the members of PRI to reflect on the six-year periods of former Presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If the governments of Zedilla and Salinase in PRI think they were better than the rule of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them to get out of their streets," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during a performance in the National Auditor, since there is no use of robe or censorship in that country.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and be required to approve this law," the American president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama, with a contribution to his personal social network account today, has joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalise students without documents.
"If you think that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and be required to approve this law," tweeted Obama.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet link to a more comprehensive document, which requires the public to join the senators immediately as the vote on this law is coming to an end.
"Since voting is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was published after 42 republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of taxes from the Bush era and the financing of the government is approved.
Such blocking, which was notified by a letter signed by 42 republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the President-in-Office expressed his belief that once a fiscal topic is resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach agreements on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of Senate Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "conclusion vote" concerning the Dream Act, so the proposal for legalization of students without documents could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although it is most likely next week.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalise about 800 thousand young people who had arrived in the United States before the end of 16 years, have lived in the country for the last five years and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or army.
However, graduates need to approve the 60-vote proposal, which is why a number of Republicans need to be assisted, so the organisation of its supporters is undertaking intensive agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators most negotiating with are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as retired senator from Florida George Lemieux, who has completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but told you that next time they won't support it.
Another republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the House of Representatives has agreed to a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.

The second cycle The pleasure of the language was a promenade where participants presented the literary gala presentation
"I understand sex in the language, but... finger to the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luis Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Language Pleasure, a cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a caption (at the other fair at the bulleted table, the theme of sex in the language was explained).
The finger to the wound "takes us to the narrows", a popular Argentine writer brought to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Library Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the cool table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Montera and Luise Garcia Montera.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave to Gonzalo Celori and that Schultz later named after a great story, in which Luis first appeared as a protagonist, who in search of the "earning" that comes from a doctor, from which she does not get the answer, although the trace of the same story is yes.
From an infector, he goes on to say, "Perseverance is not my strong side, maybe it'll be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the morning is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic that reveals the secret: "the morning is really torn apart and the symbolic scar is."
The protagonist excited herself and concluded that "the morning she managed to find out only so much that it is really open and that it doesn't exist", but she was convinced that the joys and fears in the tongue must go hand in hand.
The writer of Valenzuel was playing with both of them.
Nicaragec Sergio Ramírez also spoke with a lovely story that he called Praise the invention, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but at one point it will appear.
with the elements of magical realism tells of a famous wizard who played the dark, brought back people who went far away, or corrected the honesty that one lady had lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it were not missing, and here is quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the overstatement in the speech of the captors.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writers) laughed at the finged testimony that was presented in stories as real, but otherwise never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination as even lost the cold."
However, he stressed, "they're crazy and liars who have a bigger fantasy" and just where the reality flows and lies where one no longer knows what the story belongs to one group and what the other achieves the fictional literature of his summit.
It's actually called the Cervanto tradition.
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that allowed the invitation of the International Library Fair with her word Finger to be wounded.
The Cuban-Portugal writer showed her finger on the big wound of social violence that passes through her country - and shared it with Latin America - and is a result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs close a silent compromise that of course is not meant," she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and dimension of a compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded, whose performance also stressed "this finger to the wound of a writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that is in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which transcends dogmatism, he forgets that "no little is hidden at all times and no little is hidden at all."
"To be masters of our thoughts and realities we have to color: and to color means to often put a finger into the wound and trouble those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to trouble the authorities who prefer this black and white world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, in addition to the narrow two different styles identifying with their techniques, teams that have a visible difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve on three occasions on the decision-making series, but until now he left with the unresolved, and that is why this is an extraordinary opportunity for him.
Argentinian must have satisfied himself with the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner and played curiously with the same team following the finals.
The Santist strategy as a coach reached its first final in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when it had the difficulty of the Morelia Club, with which it was subject to a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the 2003 Clausura Tournament, he again entered the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
With Santos Laguna in Tournament Tournament Bicentenario 2010, once again against the "devils" from Toluca, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenars" (another name of the "Deportivo Toluca" club - later translated) after 210 minutes of the game uncertainly 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got to the advantage of three on one and had two opportunities to earn a title, but finally his three players passed from 11 steps and so suffered a turn to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against "Red Devils" from Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound, and the title would be of course for me, but the first one is the most important," said the coach, when he was asked about the number that speaks in the finals against him.
in the living memory has the previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned that until the decision-makers don't finish writing, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as players, because the past with the two penalties, we were ready to go out to celebrate, and I think we've learned in this, until the game is over, we can't celebrate".
She is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she believes her players: "You never try to come to a series of criminal graves, you try to end up in normal times, but sometimes there is no other option and we need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but unfortunately we got a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when it was titled in our hands, but we lost it, it left us something and let us hope that this time it will not come to something like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and enjoy the first glory that the titles bring.
United States changes visa-sharing rules
People will have to turn to the Visa Applicants Services Centre before consultation at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting period will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the process of visa negotiations at the United States Embassy and consulate will be changed.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicants Services Centre (as short as ASC) before consultation at the Consular Department.
Staff from ASC shall receive biometric information from the applicant and shall be evaluated by the Consular Division before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of visa handling will be lower, no longer requiring the payment of the fee for the meeting arrangement, the second for the processing of the application and the other for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant shall pay only one fee, which shall cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa application (including a visa for temporary staff) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to complete an interview with a consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the consular department will be here for a shorter period of time than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency approved a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could lead to a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce on Thursday an astrological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock by an expert on astrobiology, a science that deals with study of origin, evolution, dissemination and the future of life in space, at a NASA-based press conference in Washington.
When she invited reporters, NASA made sure that she represented "a discovery that would lead to evil in the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are creatures other than us who live in unwelcome conditions that were considered uninhabitable and who might be able to become intelligent creatures such as humans if the conditions under which they live are improved.
It is said that it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature uses fire for its life in some way, and that is precisely its ability to increase the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the view that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern bear fruit of the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the arrival of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet started when a opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the PRD (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Side of the Democratic Revolution" - late), PT (Partido del Labor, Czech "Side of Labour" - late afternoon), Convergencia (Czech "Shada" late afternoon) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to the House.
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "screaming" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as he excludes them.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Acylara, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López British by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally creating political marginality from the back of the Pri party (Partido Révolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutional institutional party") and PAN.
He clarified that during the following days they would speak with representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they would be again detailed by these two parties, which ended the opposition coalition.
"When I come here (opposite coalitions), I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, even not willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence stated that they are in agreement with PRD, PT and Patron, and therefore they will form a plurality group.
It's not possible to allow Congress to continue to be "twice" now after being monopolized.
Aspiring the reform of the law is not that there is endless bipartisanism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to gain more votes, as Philip Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that at present Congress has become "beneficial" two - in opposition to the PAN and PRI.
"Only one party has ruled it before, today it's divided by two."
Mr Montalvo asked that the honourable Member's personality be respected for being given a place at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five of us, who are likely to be nine, but right now seeing us at five, would not be left behind because of cursed agreements, each of us in another group, we have agreed to find a place at the table of action, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed to, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos are issued for "additional"
Counsellors in Mazatlán will pay another check to the company's discussed owner providing electrical material.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the councillor Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount paid in the second half of this year by the owner of the company supplying electrical material shall be spread to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the councillor's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued for an amount of 200.144.56 pesos and as its object was referred to as "the compensation of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for sales at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount still owed to her by the council, and how many cheques will still be sent in favour of Camach's Palazuelos.
"There was nothing purchased now, only what we owed her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this business has not yet been published in the Government Letter, according to the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the depositary has ensured that the services of the consultancy provider have not been used again.
In the previous period, after 25 July, the journal Noroest published a review of the cheques issued by its advisors to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period by Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, paid the city of Camachová Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
She also made a deal with Jumapam, where she was charging checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor location of Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of foreign tourism into the depths of Sánchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlan is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show such a port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in the Zone Dorad area, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the idea of destination, and the bad things that tourists here find to replace it with new activities or routes.
He pointed out that the bad state of the streets and pedestrians is affecting tourists who walk around here and see a disturbance, which has an adverse effect on close businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to shut down a day's business, and they have no idea of the markets they're avoiding, otherwise these issues wouldn't have been resolved for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the loss of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the councillor.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such repetition, will have to devote preventive maintenance, not only to repair existing disputes," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, but also because we deserve a clean dwelling as residents, the mayors should change their city's maintenance strategy."
Other places that seem neglected and poor are also noted, for example, the Mazatlán Emblem and El Venadito (monument, socha jelena - laten.).
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not just promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city that flows with the purity of its beaches and streets where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here and these facts emphasize something that is well-known, maintenance is missing.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in order in cooperation with the councillors, said that priority must be kept the city clean and right to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will need to be arranged first so that we can attract these places and introduce them to the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests after Congress results
Mr Davalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility for setting an example in seeking better Signalay in the various challenges he faces.
The parliamentary term of office and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is confused with the crisis and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three Party of New Alliance, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and the last from VAT, including a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations for new members of Congress is to enable them to exercise proper leadership, commitments to the company and to the various areas requiring responsible legislative work, and that the same sites and patronage patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Council for Enterprise (CCE), proposed that the recent election of 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and serve as an example on the way to better Sinaloa in the various challenges he faces.
"We expect Members to really exercise their rights without any agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become the carnival causes of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore said that it was necessary to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary overlap that would move the ruling forward by order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be committed to companies and sectors in particular, because they were the residents of Sinaloa, who gave them their vote in the past elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to take all the strength to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation."
As far as travel is concerned, he asked that the new legislators give him greater weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is unreasonable in view of the importance of economic activity, which brings currency and investment, which is also directly competing with agriculture."
In addition to providing funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should add State aid to the security and aid of the alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Dolls, cars and motorcycles are together with other toys on the list of children's wishes in the family of the Coronads Valenzuels.
For their parents, the coming feast of three kings will be difficult to fulfill, since their home is just 12 people and one berean.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar will give them toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest settlement in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, since the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because my husband's not lucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... and I'm going out on the street with the "snippers" this afternoon," said Cayettena Valenzuel's Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a doll named Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd like to have a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayettean would like a one-year-old suit.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son 'cause it was very expensive', recalls Cayettean's sadness.
For older children who were just in school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, 11-year-old, has a size of 12, 10-year-old Isaiah 10, where eight-year-old Miguel wears a size of 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks tennis, so he'd be a couple of sizes five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Crown of Valenzuels family, you can participate in the "Searching for Three Kings" campaign and bring a gift or money in cash at Noroeste's reception.
14 Supposed Drug Dealers Arrested
A dozen visits were carried out in Austria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for production and sale of Indian rope.
Fourteen people were arrested and facing various charges.
The visits took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stockholm, mostly in places that served to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 drives of an Indian rope, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that was used for production were played," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec-speaking police officer.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom claimed the bosses of this network, two men from Sherbrook.
Arrested persons had to be brought to the courthouse in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges from the production of an Indian rope, its holding with a view to trading with it, bribery and theft, among other things.
These visits took place after a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to join this arrest," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrook Police Administration Memphrémagog.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the Conservatives law, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome , while all three opposition parties on Wednesday announced that they cannot support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built a jule under your feet," said liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow any person from a ship identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The head of the Quebec Blok, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected criticisms that wanted her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrat agrees that we should take measures against illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the bare part of another bill, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the proposal of the Conservatives law because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenny accused the opposition parties.
"The Canadians collectively tell the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canadians take on a man and treat him like a paralysis."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Minister Kenny replied.
The government did not vote in confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its refusal.
One Conservative said to the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote to be held so that every opposer would be held accountable for his position in front of his voters.
The new unit does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to establish a permanent anti-corruption and anti-corruption unit, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation commission for the issue.
Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, strives to keep this idea in mind: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Research from New York on this issue in January next year.
Metropolis has been available as a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why yesterday's announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for the public security critic PQ Stéphane Bergeron to assess this notification as "a rabbit pulled from the hat" and "an amateur knee-blown solution".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be happy with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Réjeana Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in public reading.
"In addition, Mr. Charest argues that he does not want to create this investigative committee, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the establishment of an investigative commission is to demise Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General in order to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same authority as the commissioners who allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's records.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code so as to be better adapted for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would be based on a mandate for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the case-law of this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague Rob Nicholson was just dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
During Operation Jaro 2001, which hit a group of bikers, even though the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa then made changes to the gangster law.
Rivers under close surveillance.
Several streams of water have been closely controlled due to heavy rainfall that fell since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, in Shawigna, Mauritius, there was an earthquake.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
The evening came to another ground suction in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's out of the way.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by strong rainfall, i.e. 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 other millimetres was not expected from today until Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The sections of the north river and the valley of Outaouais were hit most.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres.
If we count these droplets with the shade of snow collected in some sectors, we can worry about the water currents.
The rescue service of Quebec announced on Wednesday the warning night against the dangers of the river Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in Chene, in Lotbinière, became subject to flood preparedness and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière they caused severe rainfall in some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a one-post bridge was hit by heavy rains.
Two residents had to be preventively evacuated.
In Outauais some lakes from the coast caused closure of some roads, especially in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue department has an emergency and oversees the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Water Forecast Centre has issued a warning centre against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batscan and Loop.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec's broadcast moderator, Stéphane Dupont, suffered a partial mishap before the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Standards Council (RRTV) for controversial decisions concerning social assistance and the Haitians and, as well as for gross expression during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the forecasts contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and the inexcusable negative exclusion of the Haitians from gross expression which does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the sending of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on broadcasts.
The Broadcasting and Television Board received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint by the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social aid in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the consignment were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to everyday life’s problems.
"Most of the Commission is of the opinion that the controversial episodes of the "Deputy Southern Reports" have affected the sensitive subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no result to him.
The last issue was the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort went into a media shooting that caused a lot of reactions.
Moderator CHOI said he didn't send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't really know that the needed money will really get.
The Commission is of the opinion that these comments were not justified, but that their cumulative effect does not adequately reflect the negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class shift on that thing."
"My file is intact for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use it in sending out harsh statements.
Any CHOI-FM broadcasts cooperated "on the basis of their responsibilities".
For the station which will have to notify, inter alia, these decisions once during the main transmission within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
Král du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The inhabitants of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, have an extremely special event.
An athlete who performs in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact") enters the kickbox and Thai box on the world's dads and rings and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Earthmal, who lives in Germany in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches so little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a protection and assistant to UPS, just gave his opponents a bad report when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won the kickbox category full contact and Thai box, I've introduced."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the San Show."
"The opponents who finished the first four in the last world championship in every category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won bronze."
"I ended up in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China, I finished the fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished the third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be the first year or so!"
"san show" or "sand" is a discipline from China, where the blows of the fists and feet, as well as the throwing on the ground, are permitted.
The matches are played traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, brought from this form of fight, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
No matter how Nazir Zemmal keeps one result in his career, he will courageously confirm his participation in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This contest is China's highest and most prestigious, explains a nice guy."
"It's a little equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Earthmal won his first match in his semi-final category (80 kg) before he suffered loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional, analyzing."
"There are four competitors in category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winner semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners win each category so that the only champion, king kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracts without public competition
Hydro-Québec has agreed with 450 million in contracts with companies providing hydroelectric engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
In the heart of this vanna, more than 100 contracts are the consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project totaling $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, named Energie Gérance, was co-authorised in 2004 with the selection of Hydro-Quebec to entrust its private sector with its responsibility for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any public competition.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against the consortium of companies before us poses a serious ethical problem that risks exclusion of competition and causes price increases.
"It's a new way to realize the collapse and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, the side agreements don't do secrets anymore, today they're already doing them openly," MP PQ Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
On something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says it's hard to bear how public interest can be sold like this.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, this afternoon proposed, variously denying that this contract would be a colloquial contract.
"I have my own way," she whispered and claimed that the PQ was "indecent" and "lost accuracy".
She said "that would be the least" to apologize to PQ.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is common practice around the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise so that they can respond to the call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the content of the work.
The construction is already in progress and must be deployed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It should also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, a consortium formula in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of government investigation.
If we fly at the speed of the commercial register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let's call CIMA+, Genoa, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau has particularly underlined the fact that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main sponsor of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), explained that we were forced to kill the head of the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and if there are few bidders in the competition, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is, you pick up the people who appear in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a deal with satisfaction and good price."
"But the main idea is that it's not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded by the Energy Management Consortium is part of the long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec side.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir entered into 109 engineering consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, from which Genivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energy Management".
All contracts have been concluded.
A total of $449,783,344, including a contract with Energie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known by the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before clarifying that one is more of its management staff.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire trust
More green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer very little trusts sustainable development actors, but also "non-participating" brands and environmental certificates, to be guided by this in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even though we buy in the media space that imposes on us and incites us to socially responsible consumption, this media space calls for a lack of reliable information, a failure to fulfil obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Even though consumption has increased in 2010 so-called social responsibility products, the people of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, still don't believe them too much
Two thirds of us actually say they don't believe in environmental promises just because green advertising companies are finding a measuring instrument that was developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to so-called just products, but also the reliability of the products and markings that are labelled as ecologically responsible, says Barometer.
Similarly, the policy debate on this issue is adopted as a serious only 14.6% of the people of Quebec.
However, the information on the responsible consumption appears to be the first to stimulate this site of consumption which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec’s consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would mitigate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barometer identified at the higher price of these products.
Finally, a third of the population of Quebec is incredibly opposed to the stated data about products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products to respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping in their neighborhoods and gave preference to buying food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is pleased to present itself as a king of recycling, which strives for the least impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental awareness remained clearly out of their way, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecers said they were using mass transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people in the interests of nature protection.
The walk and the wheel also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the redemption of the complex kin eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for a financial contribution to buy back the complex of eXcentris Societies Angus et le Parallelèle, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which made a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy back a cinematographic complex at the Bulvar of Saint-Laurent and who proved her mission as a film artist, did not get what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec proposes a lower loan, some of which would have been an initial expectation that could provide a basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with resources from the State.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million demand were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan have been sent to the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Enterprises in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the film project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December time to respond.
However, it seems that the State's gift hypothesis must really be rejected.
Note that the Association of Film Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was against the State's direct investment in order to be able to support the redemption of eXcentris, judging that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion called for basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his films during ten years of film art after he financed the building of the complex himself, which could have been the reason for a change by the State Financial Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shrill in Montreal, and eXcentris managed to get a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, is running a campaign to release financial resources into the private sector, believing that he will spend $700,000 to suppress the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and to promote the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devorine, so he ignores it, he thinks of his group's proposals for a reduction that were made to him.
Lifted tires to Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic American origins mentioned in knowledge through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadian minorities towards Americans, but thereby exposes their sense of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to accept her budget in 2009.
four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which was released to the public yesterday, also provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication with 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details where the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by the political leaders.
To the great audacity of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins is providing some explanation for this situation.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost baffled, may remind the political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he concluded, "by saying an elephant in these elections: all present, but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The Ambassador understands this "inspiring silence" less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better leader of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure that the government retains its confidence in the vote at the beginning of February, concerning the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, for a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government has had to postpone the pre-night meeting of Parliament so that it cannot be defeated by coalitions and that opposition parties recall their survival as a quality of the proposed plan of renewal.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, notes Washington further the negative picture that the United States is playing on the dramatic series broadcast to the CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned by the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too clever references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations by the CIA.
Another report suggests that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners with the Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case-by-case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "A paper about Omara Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, is outnumbered by a state secretary."
"The Secrets have accepted that he's reviewing the file."
Let's finally note that the people who are dealing with WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, an ex-advisor very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "destroyed".
That's what happened, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
In Cancún yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect limitation (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the further limitation that needs to be achieved to stabilise the planet’s climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN intends to launch in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of difficult realistic commitments to reduce industrially advanced countries.
According to the plan submitted yesterday, if the light bulbs that monopolize 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluorinated or, even better, electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED"), the main amount of GES emissions on the planet resulting from the lighting would be discarded.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% of the car park emissions on the planet.
In Kodani last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary plans to reduce GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be deducted from this balance of 5 Gt to achieve stabilization of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius in order to be excluded from control.
In light bulbs 95% of energy is dispersed in the form of heat and residues, that is, 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorinated light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED light bulbs, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluo-compass lamps will last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New lamps with DEL, such as those introduced this week to Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the light bulb, which gives us an idea of possible savings with a compensation plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new light bulbs can also work with reostates and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed exceptions to fluorinated light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers have established collections.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compass light bulb, but rather a heat coal plant that emits a lot of mercury needed for the production of electricity emitted in the refractory light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres run 25 000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report also details the benefits of this international programme for each country.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 heat plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The coasts of the elephants look forward to the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections on the Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, stressing the speaker of the United Nations."
"It requires all parties in the Côte d'Ivoire to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the worst date - Wednesday - to be missed three days after Sunday.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the President of CEI confirmed on television that the Commission "continued to work" in order to declare the results.
On Wednesday , challenges have multiplied around the world to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round , between retired Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alan Ouattara .
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for the "undersea" vote in the north, which the former New Army (FN) have fixed since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Presidential Election Campaign in the Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the manoeuvres for fear of the wills that were practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country had been dismissed by the supporters of the President of the Côte d'Ivoire from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council looked at the complaint made by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents feel that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, the very close political union of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who is demeaning any connection with the former rebels, condemned the detention in the announcement of the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that it would be illegal to complain to the Constitutional Council after he defended the election commission to send the results.
The second round of presidential elections, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations has pointed out in the political group of the Côte d'Ivoire that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round on 31 October, as a winner with 38% votes against 32% for Alan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France according to the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas) as shown by the provisional data with seasonal deviation corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has risen to 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the population active in the metropolis and 9.7% including the overseas areas.
The unemployment rate shall be increased by 0.1 points in one year.
In a wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks to work, whether they are looking for or not.
The current situation of young people in the labour market was still emerging with a new increase in unemployment to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in overseas areas.
In the third quarter there were 637,000 young people from 15 to 24 years of age without work, according to the International Labour Office.
As far as seniors are concerned, they have seen in metropolitan France a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in one year), which is 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% in overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from the stability of unemployment to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after the debate on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union,on the contrary, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% peace for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and brought into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste management companies and the PS brother of the Bouches-du-Rhône Governing Council, was accused and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly bribed.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment, receipt of charges for the purpose of influencing the office and holding the gun, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is a combatant and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that this is going to ask him, and not any overcrowding."
"It is easy to pursue it for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, to AFP before his client's inquiry.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent judges before his inquiry a brief statement to explain everything.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but ensures the operation of the equipment he was supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Acclamation Services, was accused on Wednesday of abuse of public funds and plots, and allowed, under judicial supervision, the prohibition to meet, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation of all the facts that have touched him."
"The investigating judge looks at it and leaves it at liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were accused and released on Wednesday night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being brought before the courts, the representative of the state administration Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is charged for receiving payments for the purpose of influencing the Office and for passive corruption".
Two Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are accused, one for the "distortion and abuse of the property of the company", the other for the "compulsive use of public funds".
Finally, business partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "depriving the company's property of abuse".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr. Guérin are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused of a contemporary case of fraud involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to clean up the money from a huge gangster.
The investigation is carried out within the framework of several open-ended anti-X investigations in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in closing public procurement, in particular in the case of waste.
From the sources of close investigation, search focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the plant in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysian Palace overrun Syria's mediation
Over more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, he gave Clotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spiring", united opinions in France, led diplomacy to a war emergency and stressed the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All of this was carefully monitored by U.S. diplomats.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the benefits of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases in Iran (a small group of travellers).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the U.S. court for bribery dealing with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they are illustrating to the bright light the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to believe that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilda Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything about it.
Diplomatic telegram, written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has the title "Iran:French comments on how to handle the case".
Counsellor of the Elyssey Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the American diplomat Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that the Americans do so much to bring their own state nationals back to power by violence detained in Iran.
"Make a noise," they say, "always express "in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocentness", "immediate liberation".
It's important to get into an uncomfortable Iranian regime that is sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they will ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, "no peace will be achieved", Iranians are "masters of avoiding manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier reminds us that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: defending hostages for the purposes of "political extortion".
It announces that the liberation of the Clotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August on the day the French Embassy is granted to it) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (Kauce 230,000 euros).
And he'll announce that the Elyssey Palace is anticipating cases of hostages, a phenomenon that will "fight".
Iranians would "be able to arrest some 1,800 other French people living in Iran in the future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares has been released for trafficking in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released for release in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which pursues an illegal Iranian network to obtain nuclear programme material, the disconnection of Majid Khakavanda is a bad report.
Did France enter into a contract?
Freedom of the Iranians for the liberation of young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysian palace, he says, was not only "sudden by this judge's decision", but was looking for an opportunity to take a stand against it.
"Talks have taken place between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "restricted" supervision of the French news service.
The Council of the Elyssey Palace is calling the phone number, suspending the phone call and then informing the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy."
At the time of the Klotilda Reiss prison in Iran, the Elyssey Palace of Efforts is developing, negotiating, through communication and organised "runs" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and an "important" role as "mediator".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation carries its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blossom" of French officials".
On what basis is such a "thank you" rate, expressed to Mr Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Even though their statements are full of French praisers, French officials in private admit that they have only a good idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "directs the validation of President Sarkozy's opening policy with Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to overcome the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate Syria what praisers can serve when it plays a constructive role in the area".
The goal is also to "sit the grain of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows that from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richier trusted him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion and uncertainty among the Iranians."
Clotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it in the Palace of Elysia.
In the communication he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of our country's liberation".
End of online game after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciválski", which will forbid adolescents to play online games at midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have problems learning at school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," AFP Jo Rin, the head of the ministry, announced to AFP Jo Rin, who has a draft law on care.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it requests companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it to be completed by the responsible employee.
It also provides free programs to people who ask for it, allowing you to limit the amount of time you spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "poor" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts connected with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is at the same time an unmistakable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, and it faces 58 other nations.
The World Championship in 2018-202: Fifa creates a host country.
Full of concern over the suspicion of corruption, Fifa's executive committee is setting up on Thursday, the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection that is politically motivated, where the fight against influence and lobbying risks leading to technical criteria.
The thing is certain, Fifa's royal competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , the traditional garden of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping that it will be able to acquire a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue to enter the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Negotiations in the background face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the review report, Fifa's English, Spanish and Portuguese documentation (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adama) may have destroyed the chances of their country, the miners, who so far hosted the World Championship only once in a year.
On Monday, the BBC issued the crown, sending a document that "screwed on a sponge" by three influential members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa unhappy and bring into trouble the English leader with David Cameron in the first place.
The President of the government hopes that he will be able to repeat the move that succeeded his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair , which managed to win for London the 2012 Olympics organisation in 2005.
Will this intensive activity suffice for England to add a new light to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the two Spanish-Portugals lack the trumps of the stadiums already prepared, his well-being (the World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give this ambitious cold shower.
Any legal measures against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only raise Russia's position, which was outside even through the gaps in its documentation (stations, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the championship did not move to Curich and publicly declared 'unfavourable competition in the preparation of the vote', in verbal attacks only barely advanced to charge the English press to the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in the mud, try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experience from 1994.
The highest economic performance in the world, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a big leap ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures appear to be premature for both countries, which jointly conducted a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Championship of China, which is desperately desired by Fifa, made the Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled out of the glove of a big esophagus in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in her expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries present more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for a flat-rate TV fee (due to time travel) paid by European countries, creating a mobile force for Fifa.
Second mandate: visibility (security)
De Gaulle really weighs it.
Mitterrand has raised his opinion that he weighs.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not interfere at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Palace of Elyssey calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the Presidential function.
It is therefore necessary to make sure that doubts persist.
One way or the other.
In 2006, friends of Jacques Chirac made demands that the third term not be excluded.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that "sometimes it will be decided in the fall of 2011".
As the UMP members recalled on Wednesday evening in the Elyssey Palace, the perspective of "two mandates" has become a little hot.
Was that an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from that.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year term of office to two.
It was just his findings, not his announcement.
It's not the first time she remembers the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you've got seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I'm considering another stage."
His previous judgments shall not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they shall not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the journey to the candidate for the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not an entrance to Ségolén Royal's cobbler, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to prove himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for the fighting arrangements rather early than planned.
Bad research on the other side.
First, voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidacy before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46%) against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidates and we don't discuss the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and watched people from the government's immediate vicinity.
"If he believes he can defeat, he won't run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, who is clearly balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its procurement of state securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central each year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exit from the crisis or, at least, a notice of stopping a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of the European demand is binding, and the Institute for Securities Issues will certainly not be able to allow itself to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today in the European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the crisis by European states.
She didn't mean to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program to buy top bonds.
"I welcome my consideration of my European partners (...)."
The evening before, in Brussels, in a hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more decisive as regards his intentions, and was satisfied with the fact that he stated that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will monitor its basic constant interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds from the treasury made by the Central European Bank doubled to nearly EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And because of the market misunderstandings of the contractors, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Total central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
No doubts shall be raised between market participants regarding the continuation of the purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economics expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operation has already disappeared for more than three months from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, the latter shall be admitted to the unlimited provision of liquid assets under large-scale conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," says Michael Schubert, the economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive easterly announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," says Norbert Brems, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In addition to its public debt market intervention plan, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the purchase volume of its bonds in order to revive the weak market", Norbert Brems adds.
In view of the exposure of European banks to the euro area debt markets, there is no longer any choice but to maintain their presence on the market.
"It is necessary, at any price, to replace the shortage of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the recovery of the paid performances of the states which belong to the most vulnerable," a significant bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates have been lifted, countries will be more anxious to reduce their debt rather than stabilise it.
It's a saving euro for this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is behind
After the beginning of the week, the worrying situation for Italy got a little relaxed, yesterday with the backflow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs of the President's regions, they said they heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as "unresolved" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then discussed.
In any event, in Tuesday, a deviation from the long German interest rate reached the 210 basic points record and the price of anti-fraud contracts (CDS) flew up to 263 points, causing certain disturbances in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "too busy" "by the brilliance of markets" and a possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencryptedly, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and poses a risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public finances deficit will represent another 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (as opposed to 3.9% of the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
From this point on, a new summary of the supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economies are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, nor short-term or long-term, because through its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise the required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, a leading OECD economy.
There is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal to express mistrust of the Messenger's photograph and may then begin to organize the elections that will be held at the end of March.
This would be the start of a period, which is not suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again stressed this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans have demonstrated this throughout the day and night, obviously there are very solidarity decisions, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's expansion in interest on European State bonds has brought water to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could damage the record of Portugal's debt, which focuses most on various speculations.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and a clear policy, based in particular on banking systems," says Economic Exane BNP Paribas.
More about "political time is running slower than market time".
The knowledge of this disrupted relationship and the hidden dangers are intensifying European countries' discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is due to Eurogroup meetings and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
The programme contains non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
As far as the European Fund for Finance (EFSF) is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has scheduled a trip to Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the evolution of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the aim of this route to raise funds, it is thus preparing a landfill to achieve this objective.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilised financial resources by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are linked to a strict measure of rapid action.
Lisbon and Madrid are different from Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at any price, applying for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the normalisation process of end-of-debt markets.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that there would be no EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to re-attain to the stock of securities.
Economies from Barclays Capital, which is an actor in the fully first business plan with European outstanding claims, consider that an additional €100 billion would be sufficient, "better" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The medium exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been delivered to this day by EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 countries have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing transport difficulties, especially on the roads of other classes in Britain, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods have now had an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined 20 times which already have a declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to the weather of France, significant snowfalls affect problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and snow is weak in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the Low-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The arrivals of snow are large enough to cause transport problems and disrupt some economic activities, Metéo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods prohibited the passage of heavy cargo - over 7.5 tonnes of trucks with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Britain is very difficult for police and the police recommend driving only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
No special measures to limit freight transport are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The county office "calls all drivers of cars the most careful on the roads and to adapt the vehicle's character".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends connecting with its airline to the passenger using air transport services.
In Great Britain there are until Thursday morning closed Gatwick airport in southern London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France in full flow, it has been raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular 23 billion meters of Grand Paris to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to allow this building to be launched, he announced the granting of a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, it is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual-source financing for contracts.
We're finally getting to the first additions today.
The 2010 Financial Correction Act, which examines the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms established to ensure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax from equipment and raising tax from the office on Ile-de-France.
First, let us read in the text of the bill, Article 15, "in favour of the public institution of Société du Grand Paris".
It is quoted as saying, "The yield of this interest is 117 million euros a year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office, which already exists because, "to be modernised to increase the profit from it and to affect the company Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Overcrowded.
That's not listed in the text.
We're four billion away.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion of the capital grant that will be mobilised by the State and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explanation of the reasons.
We in SGP don't seem to be shocked by this system.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2014 budget by 2013.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promised are still absent to subscribers, risks causing some disturbing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and causal investigators
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an apparent scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only faces the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it is talking about profound changes at international level, and it is precipitating the future of controlled regression.
But let's do the right thing.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every document made up of a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of print stamps.
The "Emergency Discovery" of Americans about the sexual life of Berlusconi is announced what has been happening for months every year in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi owns), and the caricature profile of Kadáfi has long been a theme for cabaret artists..
The rule that secret documents should consist only of reports already known is fundamental in the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Zednářes) exactly what has already been written in the previous parts.
And it's not just because the author of the occult texts doesn't like to look for new information (and he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what they've learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is a linear, and a linear (or limited) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the Libération newspaper) who considers the truth only what he himself admits.
Information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the US Embassy sent to the state resort, was also published by Newsweek a week earlier.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents become so common?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can call or fly a plane to a common dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have turned into a spy center.
Any viewer who's watching movies about the investigation knows very well that it's obviously ignored only out of hypocrisy.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public shames the obligation to confess and throws the wrong light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most intimately hidden information the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not unbeatable, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both victims and their "workers".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to understand all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
The Orvell’s prophecy has been proven since the possibility of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, a visited hotel, a used highway and so on, became a complete victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it works now that even "grapes" with the most classified information of the powerful cannot withstand a hacker's intervention, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
A lot controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you maintain power that no longer has the possibility of keeping your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is an immeasurable secret (and the immeasurable secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret immeasurable secret, because it is extracted from public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that the secret of Hillary Clinton was an immeasurable secret, meaning to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this scarred power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not be able to send on-line sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on a poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technology there is little hope that you can keep the message hidden on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled on a plane and connected with some of its colleagues.
How can they be kept in private and sensitive messages in the future?
I know that for this moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine the government factors that are carrying out discreetly the filling of formalities on uncontrollable tracks and carrying only those messages that they know to remember or rather hide rare information in the shoe underpants.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key closed cartridges: total take, attempt on spying in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had an opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means back.
One century after the wireless telegraph meant a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based telegraph.
Videocassettes (analogues) enabled lovers to film the movie step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now the CD (digital) allows only to jump on the chapters, meaning by the macroports.
We'll be on our way from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane and the transport that includes us, we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policies and communication techniques will return to cars drawn by horses.
Last note.
Otherwise, the press tried to understand what was found in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now they're embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
The year following the Kodan Agreement is the time to try to meet the commitments made by the developed countries to quickly unlock the funding (e.g. fast start or early start).
And great French hacks were discovered
In the Kodan Agreement, the developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (that is 420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU has drawn up a large esophagus to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report explaining the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent transaction that is invaluable and valued at its real value: mature countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to act the same as with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released 2.2 billion euros, leading it to the right path to meeting its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Kodan Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is achieved without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone picks the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been maintained and it adds 150 million more to it for three years the title of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with public development aid terms.
On the contrary, France considers that financing "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide public au development.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even be reduced), must comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional" ...
Another determining factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each one chooses his own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, believe that the loaned is equal to 1€ donated.
Obviously it is difficult to prove: effort is not equal.
If the use of loans can be presented for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present a single euro, which we receive, as an equivalent to one euro that we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give the following justification: it 'respects' its commitment of 420 million euros, making it 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the gifts (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan to such an extent.
Germany has asked for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their 100% gift commitments.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ within the framework of its promise, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
That's a nice little cupcake.
To sum up, when financing "fast start" France operates with double leverage: on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other hand, with real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36.1 million, it can convince itself that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that, although Bercy is the one who made such a decision) could have a double negative effect, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to give when it just lends?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The pre-financing chapter is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine, such as the UNICEF.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of managing the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and jurisdiction and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should be discussing long-term financing investments (other key chapters currently discussed): we will not be missing the question of "additionality" or how to charge loans.
France should change its position in order to become as progressive in these deposits as in others.
So the hopes are all being put into the new Ministry of Environment, Mrs Kosciusco-Morisets, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence necessary for further discussion.
An alarm concerning pesticides that children will see.
Ten years of child after one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published on this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Moving for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four foods and one light meal as a light meal for one child about ten years in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sugar, have been analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is striking: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are listed among the carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances, which could act as internal mixing glands (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted are not exceeded individually, in our research we well see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagious," the association said.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, they contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple imported from Brazil, studied as a small food, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunches in which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, dairy beef steaks, tuna in the box and even shells and gums were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The presence of nitrogen and chloroform were detected in water from the jaw of the analysis.
Steak from the salmon to the dinner was "richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not avoided.
The final risk to consumers of this "contaminant coke" is likely to be underestimated", according to the study.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) proposed to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the "growth of civilisation diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
