Republical Strategy for the Resistance to the Re-election of Obama
The leaders of the republics justified their policies by the need to combat counterfeiting in the elections.
At the Brennan Centre, however, they consider the latest myth, claiming that the cases of counterfeiting in the United States are less rare than those of death than those of stroke.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States have been reported by Republican lawyers in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most States Governments have adopted laws that make registration or voting more difficult since 2009.
This phenomenon was new since the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 bills were adopted in 2011 restricting the right to vote in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require the elector to produce a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the voter ' s registration on the day of the vote and deprive citizens of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had required voters to submit a photo identity certificate.
Indiana became the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been speeding up the spread of this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation requiring voters to submit photo identity certificates in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have the identity of the photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a document in 2012.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity certificate is often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people under $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters from 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identity with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students are not allowed to use the identity of the photograph issued by their educational institution in a number of states, who are considered to be voting for candidates from the Democrats.
The same states therefore allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for the Republicans, to use the certificate issued by those clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no State has required evidence of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of the people from Latin America.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators introduced in 2011 laws to abolish the voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent decrease in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the early voters were African-Americans, although the latter constituted only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was true of those from Latin America.
By representing only 11 per cent of the voters, they constituted 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, which constituted 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted early.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were pledged by democratic governors.
The most diverse laws were suspended at the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This led to a partial limitation of the negative impact.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the identification of the photograph.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the predominance of the laws adopted, with a clear focus on influencing the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electorate to win the presidential election.
It is too early to confirm with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
There is no doubt that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter ' s appearance.
In this sense, such actions have partially discredited the system of American democracy.
Screening the cancer of the front iron: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces faulty results, false and sometimes false positives that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly dispersal, have even more doubts.
Is it a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen a number of cases of infection among the study groups, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among patients who had gone through boxing and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that metastases are 30-40 per cent higher than those who have not been boxing.
Therefore, I would recommend that the test be carried out at 50 years of age, or at 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at high risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer has been detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and overwhelming.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his or her cancer by offering him or her options without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a long-term risk to life, but by choosing, in these cases, for the benefit of active surveillance of the disease.
To this day, many men with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive or life threatening.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more, we have precisely defined the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I would still recommend that the test be carried out.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not this test is to be performed.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mowember has created a tool to assess all for and against the passing of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains a better way of reducing the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and driven enough, 30% of cases of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smokes, this figure would increase to at least 50%," says Andre Bolé, the Canadian Association of Cancer Press Secretary.
However, 10 per cent of cases of cancer are estimated to be hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
"Even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers," says press secretary Andre Bola.
Encouraging fact: Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to the CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct rain, food, ingestion, and mattresses.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the bladder”, adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many cases it increases the risk of breast cancer.
Cobalt products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or insulating may lead to the formation of cancerous substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the organism and lead to cancer development," explained the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at this point, the results of these studies cannot be called unique.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The analyzer doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' bozone caused this damage -- and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that was predicted to exist within the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, "minimum imperfect" description of nature and behavior - but which had previously failed to find an experienced way.
But the physicists aren't sure until the end that it's Higgs' turn.
We know, no doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle, and that it is a strong reminder of the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet available for full assurance.
So let's just imagine what Higgs is about, because the chances of failing seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a law that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot occur in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to do this, even try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while the physics of the elementary particles is quite strange, it is said that it also has one law of the same nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paula, which insists that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantity” state, is the “state”, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-being citizens called farmers, who are wisely subject to the Paula principle.
On the other hand, the bozones, the disgusting gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything at least to this principle, which means that they may be at the same place at the same time.
According to the site (i.e., totally unusual) Patche Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bozones are, in turn, divided into two groups: mesons that we are not going to talk about here and “parts of the force” through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which in some ways belong to the Higgs boson.
These very bozones should be emphasized, not all of them as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal bozone: photon, or "parts of light", which is "currier" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into the dust.
This “fraction” produces an electromagnetic wave (the world, or an infrared emission, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon -- and therefore one of the bozones of “power carriers”.
More stable fields
The same is true of Higgs's bozone, with only the difference that in order for this bozone to appear, another field, Higgs' field, must be violated.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; in order to provoke it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen stream, whose surface could only collapse a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle acceleration, like the one that's operating in CERNE, the Great Adron Collider, which is a 27-km ring!, to achieve such enormous energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs bozone and the mass.
Actually, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not. For example, the paper will never stick to the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others do not.
So, what can all this research do for you, Mrs. Plamodon?
They are used in science to check the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also enables the physicists to see the difference between the results of observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them are passionately demanding that such a gap be found, i.e. the slightest discrepancy can open the door to “new physics” and close some of the models doors.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (o!) or dark matter, which constitutes about 80% of the universe (o!).
But until such differences were found in CERNE.
Consequences
It would be more difficult to predict the benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average man, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
Note: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's laboratories could not even imagine what revolution would cause their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who himself developed the first continuous laser (formerly pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was initially seen as a “laboratory gadget”.
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the accompanying research toolkit.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his 1969 optical research.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as an eye for all the world's digital cameras and deserves the Nobel Prize for Physics 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Greater Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission on Dignity of Death in Quebec has recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon and the bill is being prepared.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this important area.
The debt has tried to look closer.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Montereggio.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've spent five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of the Palliative Care Victor Gadbua in Belarus, where he first arrived.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an amazing weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet alone and even feed yourself.
Sitting at a table with an appetite for dinner, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He dares, even dares to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
The courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is to be humiliated," he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for this disease.
"We've been taught that a man has to pee," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's shelter.
Regress to the status of the child, for some unbearable humiliation.
"All depends on human ability" to calm down, he claims.
Because many people believe that important events are happening in the worst part of this fall.
Patients entering Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all sick with cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the doctor and nurse's team is no longer providing the so-called “treatment” assistance.
Mrs. A., 89 years of age, most afraid to die "in the consciousness of drowning".
But that's why the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says before letting her wear a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for the next few days of her son's last visit from Italy.
Victor Gadbua's shelter provides body care and nutrition assistance through a group of volunteers.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, each of the 11,700 inhabitants has one place at the palliative aid institutions.
That's very little, considering that sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, a doctor of shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or mental, it's a comfort.
We will agree to provide the dying person with oral flakes of brandy or pepsy, given that he will ask for them.
We don't have diabetes anymore to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. X. who died tonight.
His son had this beer in his legs the next morning.
"We help people as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
Victor Gadbua's shelter is not the same as the previous one.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with their family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and trying everything to survive.
"In the last half of the year, between three and five chickens have always been cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbua are from the house and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palliative Care Society at the House of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this big gap in Quebec's health system that causes many doctors to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps with suicide.
As of October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care lights, was circulated by Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Lappuant, and was showing that they did not agree with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec ' s health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, - she says - I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance office in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients by the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hope of surviving Ellen Richard was already minimal when she discontinued her exorbitant chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she would regret that I was stopping fighting, she said.
At the same time, she told me my days were considered!
There Is No All-Powerful Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who are dying are grateful to the medical staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team relieves them of their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely universal in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to disease in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of their lives, doctors often use a palliative session, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who are unable to alleviate pain will be able to access the palliative session.
The sick who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want to be euthanasia," that means, "I want it to be easier for me."
This report was made possible by a journalist grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell every day what they know about the huge “system” that leads to the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade unions and Mafia.
Industry, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's funny how this system breaks up after all the funds have been put into action, Jack Ducheno, a deputy and former Montreal police chief."
It was because of the scandal in 2011 that the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the prime minister of that time from the Liberals, Jean-Share, was very reluctant to accept.
Düšeno's report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars on contracts” if some held back their instincts.
The Sharbonno Commission “has already moved two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “open the schemes for individual persons”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011 with a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molot, which had forced Montreal ' s " eastern cartel" after 2009, to stop the overrun of contracts.
Over the past few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markett, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, he recently retired from the position of Mayor Lavala, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
It is suspected of having received repeatedly the receipts when placing public orders.
In addition, a formal indictment was made to several Montreal communication service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The last bomb was bombed by an investigation into the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
For several years, Zambito spent 3% of the value of the contracts entered into in Montreal, to some broker related to the mafia who, in turn, transferred the money from Mayor Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito poured money to the right and to the left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mainly the Liberals then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Channeling contracts where value is exceeded
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unrelentingly.
Gil Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts that he had overrun.
Other officials responsible for road construction have acknowledged that they have received over 30 to 40 per cent of the bill with false supplements.
Then, an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party boxes with dirty money.
After these disclosures, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first members of Montreal to be alarmed.
Mayor of the River-de-Preri District in the east of the island, it has been opposed to the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to the construction boom.
70 per cent of the money spent in pre-election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would eventually begin, she would “smear a thread to understand the functioning of an ant’s raining system to stop gangrene and identify the culprits”.
This process is described as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
We're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dušeno notes for his part that “the agents have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars” but is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who know about the scheme” but who do not participate in the machinations.
Considering that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes, "I was told that it was only a faint reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but it says it will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit the costs of elections, the policy will be dirty money.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We can’t go down below; with courage in essence, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legality.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dušeno invites those who laugh to look into their own court...
"PZ - not FK Barcelona!"
In this season, you've achieved an unusual range in the PSC.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be by a new measurement of the GSP.
Great games have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also made many contributions.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's simple.
It's all going on very fast in football.
But I'm not burning.
From the very beginning of the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfonten and until my arrival in St. Etien, I have always been moving forward.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotti...
The completion of this summer is not a news event for very high-level players.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a game like me wanting to be at the level and to be taught as much as possible.
Furthermore, Carlo Anchelotti supports my position.
He's been helped by substitutes like Claude McKelele, who played in the same position as me.
The officers are the owner of the situation?
Of course.
The officers are respectful of all technical personnel.
He is not equal in the First League today, and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with big games.
I think he'll bring new Paris titles.
In January, I had a encouraging conversation with him.
That's when I got out of a whole series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSC season?
In the First League, Lion took the lead in us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have effectively qualified in one eighth final.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We can give our word to the person with very good European teams.
We first want to finish our first team in front of Porto to be able to win a match at the eighth final.
Can the GSP be the first-class European club in the short term?
He's got a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win titles and position for the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, the GSP has the means to make this project real.
Not getting a title in the First League, like last season, would be a big mistake?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
Last season we were close to this.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are supposed to call the champion.
But the other team, Monpelle, played even more fantastic.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Leon and Bordo have entered the fight for title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSC?
It's normal that we're expecting a lot, given how much we've invested and what games we have.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home, and we still find something to criticise, of course, it's a little disturbing.
We ask ourselves what people expect of us first.
We'll never be able to win every exit with a 4-0 account.
We're not F.C. Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved at the Champions League that we can meet the challenges of today.
Look at Manchester United, who can't go to an eighth final no more than two seasons, even though they've spent a lot of money!
In view of the amounts invested, we have represented you at 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a distraction to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who weren't high last season, were "excited" by this new PSC.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The GSP seems to depend entirely on the actions of the Golden Ibrahimovich.
Well, what if they say there's some "golden addiction"?
This simply means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he kills a lot of heads.
He came here to prove that he was the star of the First League.
Where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star of the world.
In the group, we respect him as a man and a player.
He also respects those around him.
What he did is truly unique.
This also stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collection of France?
As a disappointment.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting some time playing.
I've seen a lot of things out there, and I've been out of there a lot.
Today, I can play good back-to-back games.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized in the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didi Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got good positions in the back team for the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to playing games, and he inspires victory.
What was Lauren Blanca like?
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us for Euro.
I hope Didie Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Good earner (1-1), broken up in Spain on 16 October, is this a basic match?
This match gave us faith.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, my career wasn't like that.
Pay and sell without bank assistance - with Bitcoin
Full opposition to the current cash exchange based on central banks listed transactions between the receiving parties and the commission fees for their processing.
In addition to the frequent occurrence of these technologies, it is evident that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into a dollar, euro ...) and a protected protocol for the exchange of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between participants at one level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites are being taken by battles to make donations or as a means of payment.
The battle course, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared with world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency published in October was interested in this system.
He describes the battle as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like ordinary currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other virtual currencies, such as “credit” used to promote video games that are earned in the game process or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchange).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But the exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central body.
In Bitcoin, all networks are simultaneously accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between the two users actually takes place between the two e-mail addresses.
Only for each new payment the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network may also check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the battles used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the mathematical task of sending to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is a phase of file hashing, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers are taking a new transaction and adding a number before they're all "tossing" together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus carried out with a nerve related to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the sake of fraud, the user wished to pay twice the same amount of money (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is divided regularly between the sexes, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of battles is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided into one million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The network's life has already been filled with flights and falls.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But the money is also lacking.
Major games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, are allowed.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book and found that almost 80 per cent of the battleheads were not in circulation.
Giant sales were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmkvist, who works at Coinabul, who is involved in converting battles into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another sponsor of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in current money) or a non-contact payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is a cost-effective way out.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's enough just to provide an address that can be photographed and identified by phone, explains Pierre Nuaza, making sure he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to review the various risks considered to be high today in the event of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Sorobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan Christians, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and wounded.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of Christians who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, the old and the archaic, so that even the jihadists, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbek, and the Tajiks join them.
They are patient, sometimes helpful to local rebels, but they will be no longer as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the trees planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Freight convoys and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no taboos on Kabul.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, and the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the blackout of these Christians, in which Al-Qaeda defeated them, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former Mojaheda, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a submissive position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become agents of State land grabbing to re-sell them under the construction of returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them are not even fighting themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that wouldn't be a thief.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have contributed to American generosity: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people have given up on war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to go back to the darkies of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed warriors, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders have already taken steps to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, as a model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the status of prime minister that had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But since the 1950s, even before, his country depended on foreign assistance.
The industry has not been put on foot, nor has any fluid worked, nor has any irrigation system been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is done except fruit and vegetables.
A private initiative was given priority.
In a country destroyed by the Thirty Years of War, State control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the sense that the Western countries were there to take possession of them.
There is no energy to process iron or copper on the ground, no means of transport to export them through the mountains, no means of mining.
The Chinese have almost left the media in Mess Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations on one beautiful day.
The conclusion of the French military units was concluded on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: girls, boys, French-language faculty at the university, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to “conquer the heart and mind” and to accomplish the impossible task of matching assistance with offensive operations, the Military Civil Service at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in ten mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intense involvement of local workers, have helped to keep up the pace: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and land expansion.
What do we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
Much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers wanted, as they told me, they needed little military support that would be well-controlled and direct to them.
The difficult nature of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risk step taken by President Muhammad Morsi.
While Egypt was divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, he decided to play the va-bank.
After all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitution would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, the President continued in his "automatic brigade", continuing "to violate this word" and "to support the law".
His followers were convinced that this was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held for fifteen days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to give up their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
For the President, this is also a way of restoring public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction prevails throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he told American weekly Time in an interview.
More than that, the call for an accelerated vote goes to the ultimate of the Egyptian people: " Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself with extraordinary powers," which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Founding Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to deliver their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the article was voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few differences of day had occurred around... the time for prayer, because some members felt that the hours of the Foundation were wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consisted of 234 articles.
The object of general attention was, in the end, article 2 of the 1971 Constitution, which stated that “the principles of the Sharia are the principal source of the law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to apply more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testimony of their goodwill and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
"Licestery" is the answer to the liberals who see only the pier in it.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Shariat laws.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sofia Memory, this is a matter of concern, i.e. “People who are intended to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe theocracy's birth."
Many Liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next Rector of this university appears to be somewhere less moderate than the present.
"There is no particular religious interference at present.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not scholars, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that “a circle of article 220 may arise as the terms used therein are borrowed from a religious lexicon.
This applies, in particular, to "fix" [Islamic case law, preambular order].
And in the future, there may be a question of how many civil judges are competent to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized because it gave the President broad authority.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were in the old regime.
Another point of dispute: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the Court of Civilian Persons be prohibited in military courts, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Liability for blasphemy has been maintained and there is now a ban on insults, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles mention the protection of women, says Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, the demonstrations were scheduled for the second afternoon.
In turn, the Heads of State will go out on the street on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop Earth and the sea from the desert
The Promised Land unites itself with the grandeur of Bible truth, modern comfort, and natural beauty.
“AIF” has given five of the most important reasons for being in Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, is to be visited.
It is believed that all who enter this “buy ” will receive God’s favor.
And Galilee is Jesus' place of miracles: turning the water into wine, walking in water, calming down the storm, and filling up the nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples, and after his resurrection.
But most of the temples in Jerusalem.
The believers here walk the Path of Scurbie or the Cross Path of Jesus (in Latin, Via Doloroz).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where there was a court, and leads to the temple of the Lord at Mount Golgoph, to the place of Dispersion, the Stone of the Anointed One, and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here, however, is a symbolic Christian Pop of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree from which Jesus was crucified grew.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews - Stan Placha, who left the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave here notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Perform vertical travel
The ruins of Massad’s fortress remained a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 B.C.E.
They are located on the rocky slopes of the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are enthralled by alpineism can walk to it.
The rest of the people on this historic summit are delivering a lift on the canal road.
And in the north of the country at 1600-2040 there is a famous Hermon mountain resort, where in the winter months there is a huge flow of tourists.
He's getting a bus shuttle from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mountain range is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, on the top of the mountain, the gods of Christendom were said to have lived.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in that country.
You don't go all the way in for one trip.
But at least five of them, most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israeli Museum, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth visiting the Tel Aviv Art Museum.
Its exhibition includes a wide range of impressive artists and expressionists, Moné, Pissarro, Renoara, Cezanna, Sisley, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
At Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Ban Museum, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with a crowd of visitors and visitors at that time.
In Caesarea, you must enter the unique Rally Museum, where you can love the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir benches.
Access is free, and donations are not categorically accepted.
The Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or the Yad-Vasham in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children ' s Memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in child shelters and gas chambers.
You're going into it, and you're going into absolute darkness.
The stars are moving.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main districts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in the winter months in the Red Sea, water temperatures are below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 ° C] and the air is heated to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it is bathed for a year.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 m below the ocean level.
It has a laurel that is easy to hold onto even those who are not able to swim.
Landscapes around are not really beautiful.
They come here to conduct a course of treatment with salt water, rape, and fecal dirt, and to treat the dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus to bring the nerves in order.
Touching the Secrets of the Ancient
They are kept by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shores of the Mediterranean.
Through him was the famous Sea Way that unites Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persis saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of walking through the tiny spots called the Zodiac signs.
They say if you hit the walls on the "your" sign's street, Fortuna's gonna be nice.
Young men from all over Israel and even other countries could meet in Jaffo.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the strength of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A tourist on the note
When moving to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
The money on the trip is better than in the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange on the chocolates (now $1 - 3.8.).
City transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram, and in Haife there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting Lower City to the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
In all types of urban transport, there are 6 chocolates that can be loaded for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is celebrated on Saturday night.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are stopped.
And on Sunday morning, we start working Sunday.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only sausage, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and cheese, where milk is mixed with meat.
It offers a wide selection of berries and beef, soups and desserts prepared in coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, walnut shells, fruit and vegetables.
There are no flying dogs on the streets of the Israeli cities.
That's why there's a lot of dehydrated basketball that's got to play on their own.
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and don't give up the bites.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will range from $37 per day (Hyundai Gettz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike's going to be about 15 bucks a day.
Tickets in the museums are on average 30 chocolates.
Language Numbers
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
The most important travel and relaxation was the arrival of U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
In the Promised Land from January to October 2012, there were 118,000 Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more than the 2010 target, until visas were cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and possible" to Moscow will lead: migrants copy money into language
As long as MPs and human rights defenders dispute that the law on compulsory language testing will be binding, frauds have already appeared in the country trading “lipe” certificates.
In Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia, 13 million people arrive annually.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support the remaining families.
As of 1 December, the law entered into force that each migrant worker would be required to submit an examination for knowledge of Russian.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and community, housing and various trade.
However, in time, promised at the IMF, tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
However, it will take not only language but also Russian history and the basics of legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for the purpose of obtaining it and for the extension of the permit to work.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a public language.
The law does not apply and the people who have successfully obtained the diplomas and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, entitlement and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute of Puškin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the IGU, the SBGU and other Russian knots.
Migratory testing will be available in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The test initiative was supported by both the Members of the House and the IMF.
And here are the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press: what is it, actually?
What will change the knowledge of the language for both the Russians and the arrivals themselves?
First of all, the migration service is responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “hard slavery”.
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian FMS Mission in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
There are problems for migrants who do not have a profession, education that does not know a language that does not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding of the language -- sure of Sebelev -- the future migrant is destined to face people who, in the form of assistance, will take a "way" to a bitter narrow bar, where he and his dozens of likes will spend months without food and documents, kneeling for 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"One is promised to their family, and they are deceived when they arrive, pick up passports, do not pay the promised salary," says Chief of Labour Migration ISS Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't move, you nerd!
However, as long as many citizens of the Middle Asian Republic who are working in Russia are recognized not only to know the language of the country they are seeking but also to write to their own people with difficulty.
Of course, it's not as bad as their fault: a few Turkmen, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford to get even such primary education.
For their families, there is something even to feed their children, not to say that they should wear, dress, and equip them for school.
As a young person, such children are sent to work for the first time.
It's hard if you don't know the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
True, the law on the language of human rights defenders is one important point.
The test will only be carried out for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastors continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or the side entrance is prevented"
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not that simple.
The reason is in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization is worth between 12 and 16,000 rubles.
And here's a fake registration that can be done fast and in half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we mostly have fake documents, no registration, no warrants, no cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," was shared with the journalists of Tajikistan's citizen Umed Huskadamov.
"Come on, don't get it, buy it."
On the first day of entry into force of the language law, it was found that there were not only migrant registration documents.
Several “lip” language test certificates have already been seized by FMF staff.
The sub paper is printed on the standard colour printer.
Of course, they did not give new owners the task: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier to carry out the tests had paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice as much as the cost of official testing as it would be for a migrant worker in three thousand.
In that the main task is to protect the system from corruption in the near future so that “shorts” cannot be simply bought, met by government representatives and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities are able to promise that they will not be able to successfully test for the first time, they will be able to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
MVD does not engage in the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Justice proposes to step up the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To launch fires at the weddings when there was no victims, and to the battle set up by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the use of trauma in public places and increase the age from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the opinion committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Jarowa and promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the House in the near future.
Not all is enough that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by turning the hooks.
There was an open letter in the network, which the authors of various public shooting organizations were required to give up “unintended aggravation”.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, according to Russian law-enforcement lawyer Vasili Lesnikov.
According to IMF statistics, 142 firearms registered in internal affairs were committed in six months in 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were reported in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil weapons legislation does not allow a criminal to enter the black market.
Now, according to them, any low - price weapons can be found in Moscow.
In the meantime, the CDM claims to control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is filled with several channels.
The five main channels are described by the Colonel in the resignation of Victor Baranec, who has worked ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and Gender.
Screenshot of a site receiving orders for weapons
The first is an “army or military trace”, which was stolen during fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons and Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," says the Baranec.
The next type of “black weapon” is stolen by criminals from force forces.
The Baranec explains that there are also police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal “stables” are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were specially made to cover the gap," said the former military.
According to Barantz, they are bringing in weapons manufacturers.
“There are now private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and are putting weapons out of the field on the black market, including Moscow,” said the expert.
Another "black" market source is smuggling.
There are particularly large numbers of guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kyrgyz.
"There's a production, sometimes a craft, and there's a mafia that's organized a stream," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The experts analysed the reports of the IMF and Russia, the criminal literature and open arms portals.
A major part of illegal weapons, researchers write, comes from the army and force agencies.
Half of all weapons in the black market have been found “to blame officials whose work is related to weapons”, says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons originate from armed conflicts, 14 per cent from arms production, and 5 per cent from black archaeology.
The consultant in one of the arms stores, who asked not to call him his name, assures us that a weapon found by black miners has long been missing - too old.
Most often, he says, for a new party, the sellers go to the military warehouse.
A man buys a unit through a flag, such as a TT gun.
They write it down, they hand it over through the locker.
"He transports her to the city and sells 900 euros here for a two-storey thing," he says.
" True, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when the crime detection plan is being burned, they conduct a check-up with illegal arms dealers," the consultant added.
"How in the bright shop"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at the sites, on the blogs until I got a friend who suggested that we come to the God platform, where there will be a person who will take me to the corner, where we'll trade.
I only knew the price of the stand there.
military observer Victor Baranec
I need a friend who's got a date to get me, a salesperson tells me.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come, provided that "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to be handed over to his daughter's tooth."
I'm even getting a couple of castles right now through the man I'm sure of.
He's also putting them on me because he knows I won't give it up.
Newsmen are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranec tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared to publish an article on it.
The schematics, he said, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where it was "everything."
"I felt like I was in a bright shop," remembers the soldier.
According to Barantz, the buyer is not offering a cat in the bag - everything can be tried.
I'm a potential customer. I'm not just buying. We're going with a salesperson in the woods.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are good, we start trading," says the expert procedure.
A sofa shop
Internet search results on sites and groups in Contact, where they offer to buy weapons “for different purposes”.
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.

Fast-food and supermarket workers build in the United States
Work on the MacDonalds Box leads to the fourth of all American teenagers
In recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universities and fast-food restaurants, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Free Chicken.
As long as no one has to predict whether the wave will turn into the ninth wave or will be resuscitated in the early stages.
The actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by several Walmart workers and fast-food systems, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations in them.
Until this sector is almost covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when a cheap sale agency in America took over millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by bribes.
On that day, some Walmart employees, with 2.2 million people worldwide working, left their jobs and picked up with trade unions and left-wing activists at the corporation store, whose goods are based on modest and medium-sized people.
Walmart sells everything in the light, from chicken, hunting roses and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only retiring at their place of work.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart could afford to sell the goods in part because he paid little to his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of autoloaders or manual scanners.
Shareholders in Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and recalled that the value of the health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
They told a typical Walmart employee who received $9.5 an hour, the cost was not in cash, they said.
Scholars at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increased its average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's going to spend on pay right now.
If Walmart fully translates wages to buyers, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents.
In a year, they're going to spend some $1.39 more than they are now.
The Walmart parties note quite well that protest actions have taken place in all nine states and have not caused any minor damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued at her shops from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and Walmart was selling about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, her cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left Huffington Post that the workplaces had left a total of “less than five” Walmart staff, and that the protest action was the most “priority pier” that organized its trade union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the University of Walmart (who are not complaining in this progressive city and therefore are not here yet) and MacDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and pay you for an honest job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the forest of New York City
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants of fast food increase over time, but slightly, and on average, their number of employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
They're less than anybody in this town earns.
As there can be money in New York, it's impossible for me.
Once through the MacDonalds, there were four American teenagers who were working on their post-school trips, living with their parents.
Few have seen or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly talking to McDonald's employees, who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes feed on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, a comment is posted that the author notes that it is irresponsible to introduce children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protest participants, who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cashiers start paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. more than double their current minimum wage.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast food.
The American Law prohibits administrations from preventing and punishing activists of the trade union movement by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the unusual flow of personnel.
Non-conformity
Noise protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The event culminated in a mid-day meeting at McDonalds near the Times Square, where several local democrats, in particular the forest member Jumein Williams, said: "Macdonalds says he sells billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York democracies, such as the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we need to make a friendly contribution to fast-food workers in order to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, this was the most important event in the history of American fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, and not all of them were workers of a rapid survey, in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It's not clear if this spark of mass movement is going to give birth.
"As long as you cheat your brain, you get a mean."
A popular theme of modern technology fans of the added reality has recently been adopted mainly through the assumption of special points.
At the beginning of the summer, the current model was displayed by Google at its annual conference, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, from a discussion with the head of an interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Sharam Izadi Laboratory, it is clear that for scientists in the company, the eye is a phase.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Please tell me in general what your research team is doing.
- We're dealing with human interaction with cars, but we're trying to break the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in mass starved at a phase of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes with a finger.
We would like to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the crucial changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox plug-in and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because it's all interesting to take care of.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect transmits interaction to the physical level, many still occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion has not yet been very far.
We're trying to change this, we're working on really three-dimensional image systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to put a computer peace into our physical, make it more connected.
To that end, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable way.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voting?
Popular stuff, but aren't they overestimating it?
- It must not be called a panacea - it is a matter of privacy, because it does not always want to inform the environment of its actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one's in line.
For example, in order to manage devices in public places, we had a project that we thought about gestures, but not masseuses, but those expensive, short ones.
The gestures were recorded, not by the device camera, but by a hand bracelet that fixed bone and muscle movements.
As long as he's big, but theoretically, he can be reduced to the size of his manual hours.
But the future of a mixed type of governance, for example, gesture+voice.
- That's how?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this gas bank?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- It's not mandatory, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will allow for more precise identification of human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they're giving a good depth clearance, it's very important.
- If you're talking about working with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Don't you have permission, depth or anything?
In principle, the present generation is what we can take back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it's not in megapixels itself, it's as a matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to the algorithm designers.
So you need to remember not only the X- and Y-axis license, but also Z-axis license.
It's also very important speed, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are purely minor, especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes from our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor with a controlled delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, I would very much like the equivalent of such a device, which does not require a second-long increase in staff.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter, and the other is a signal receiver.
And here's the third camera. It's actually a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the camera curve and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her eyes to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the day-to-day use of eye-to-eye technologies, this is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, to play all the time, having a smartphone in your hands isn't very comfortable, but that's what I think: the coolest option would be a "passing" complementary reality when you could switch from point to point to smartphone, projection display, and so on.
Eyes are a very personal device, in which their strength (private things you see only) and at the same time weakness - the added reality of the eyes will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual golographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also simply fatal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What are the responses that your group prepares for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh on the basis of human interactions and machines.
I think that the eighth could be an addendum to tactile feelings.
While one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a fitting floor for the image.
She's doing a good job.
But there are technologies that are really designed to give these "air-carts" vulnerabilities -- for example, the interference of several ultrasonic devices at a certain point, where the finger is, gives you a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you've been sucked into.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also a forward direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that has to be tackled for a long time, such as forcing a person who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is on open, virtually endless work and on the concepts of running roads (not only clubs), moving platforms, and huge planes.
As long as the brain is being cheated on average, work has been taking place for many years.
This is what works on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher - many things in an absolutely initial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Peterburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avantgarde of culture and art.
The top list has already reached the bright actors of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe through all-Russian knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kiril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all the reds that meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer now, at fashion tusks and refurbisheds.
Kiril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers where they don't show up.
Kirill Miller is one of the most serious of the Petersburg socio-philosophers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the Petersburg Avant-garde in the late '80s.
He is also the person of the city, by his appearance on the streets, causing a smile to the city, which lifts everyone’s spirits.
He had recently taken in his hand the charm and became a Petersburg charmer, for he had created for this complex role all his divine existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city all over the red, not in yellow or red, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model that deals with the type and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society that feels not serious is causing aggression and a lack of good character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you know he was supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in D.C. Nevski, where my work was shown.
I realized this was my way.
Then the concerns of the old free-of-official artists passed, and the new, free-of-the-art types were unpopular to me.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-seasonal one that led to the Puschinski-10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me into the theater, clothes, music, all genres except words.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to feel at the centre of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Puschinski-10, and there was a music and art club, a divine club, a house of the Petersburg god.
Many were born there: NOM, Tekila-Jaz, I remember how Shnura brought up the "Echo Van Goga" project.
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the banner, they were in a tight trick, among them was the modern composer Igor Vodwin.
When the group played live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes until the Hali-gali era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we took his great career, and he got basic education and education.
Gallery D 137, Griboedov Club, this is an art clinic.
That's where our workers and they've always gone.
I'm a hero yesterday when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, and the award was "People of Our City".
In the name of "The Frog of the Year," I was named, my culmination was over.
In new times, old rules are hard to work, and I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a familiar way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a strong sense of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program show, "Russian Museum in Clones."
The clones are an interim category.
I used to be social, and now being like this is painful and scary.
But the clowns are getting all blurry, the tragedy is getting worse.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace by totalitarian redeployment.
They are now in the clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner man.
Maybe you can't give him your hand and spit in the rose.
And the fraud will be taken away with the help of the refiguration.
We recently saw you as a city charmer.
Who I don't want to be.
- Well, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures.
People used to crash into a room, the god loved one, the god loved the other.
Now it's all broken into micro-society, now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stassa Mikhail's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got junkies on him, where the sex-social sphere works.
And 300 people will come and 10,000 will not come, and as a result less management, money, everything will flow.
I've got worshipers, mainly not to cheat them, not to waste what they used to do.
In my youth, I wrote pictures that one collector had on the wall next to Falc and Larion's hangings.
I started with pictures that usually end.
It's often a misconception.
They say: a culture of spiritual, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a person of yesterday's culture, growing up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused to pay for painting.
I'm such a culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an officer of culture.
But not every one of them can take care of culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in the culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are now good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're excited, because we need higher experts who will properly assess and guide these experts.
Now it's blossoming.
The same is true of Erarta, but they are distinguished by what they say honestly that not all modern art we accept are artists who need to look for themselves at other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
And on our rocks art is growing hard.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to shows, concerts.
We have this layer of tuna.
We need to make the art as fashionable as it was in the beginning of the past century.
Project implemented under the St. Petersburg Grant
Born in Space
Land is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
Coves of spaceships with landowners on board are headed for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve mankind, is the main question of how to continue our generation in conditions of singleness or on the same reserve?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, the present planet is only two that can be conquered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars" is considered to be the senior scientist of the State Astronomical Institute, named P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or at Venus orbits... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began with the flower.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of those who grew up in the mountains of the earth did not differ from their earthly varieties.
Then it's the extraction into the orbit of infectious, tiny fruit flies.
In 1979, eggs were sent to space to check the development of the embryo in conditions of pregnancy.
We get a perfectly normal bird coming out.
And that's what's going on.
“The problem of the bird’s ability to resist, to get up on its legs and start moving,” explains RAN Vladimir Sychev, head of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP).
I can't stand it, the birds are indisposed.
Ten hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of the instincts.
The birds didn't respond to the light and the sound.
And the trouble was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we've torn the birds out, then we've given up, because it's just impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sichev's experiment with the birds.
With animals last time, the biological "minoch" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, there will be only one-sided persons on the Bion biostation.
There was an experiment with crises that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural there.
"It was on biostations once, but again, it is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing at the space crisis, a seed appeared.
But to be able to reproduce directly into space is not yet achieved.
It's a simple task.
Animals, losing their normal habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
But man, unlike the beast, can in principle be.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking and are able to create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not being carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was in Tereskov.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a female organism.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether he'd stay after the flight to space.
If she can have a baby after that flight.
"No one has answered this question," says the veteran of the Wachtang Wacchadze missile industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentin Terreskov gave birth to a daughter.
The father of Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitzka, twice in orbit and even working in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have a few units of spacecraft that's all gone after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," is the result of the spacecraft, the Soviet Union hero, the Russian hero Valerie Polakov.
Yet, mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory flight preparation phase.
Here, under zero floating conditions, the cosmonauts develop open space working skills.
Water simulates impotence.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a strange environment, for breast-feeding is a birthmark.
Little jots, as it were, confirm that life on the ground had come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between having a baby for about 9 months with its mother in the surrounding fluid, making it easier for her to get used to the water.
In principle it makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the time of the first bath, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," says Marina Axen's breast-swimming instructor.
In a word, if a baby’s virginity is more natural, it is necessary for a woman to have gravity, the strength of gravity.
Very quickly, the muscles of life, the tasa, and the ability to produce fruit are shaken.
All right, let's get it down, based on birth-stimulators.
Of course, in a special room, she's gonna kick him out.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth’s pull, the organism does not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
It is not possible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need for life.
"And this experiment that we're going to take with you, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally disabled person to Earth," said IMBP Bioethics Committee leader RAN Igor Pestov.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
In time, however, it will be a reality when earth’s inhabitants on their ships go to a distant planet, which will be a home for their offspring born in space.
Head of the Audit Board: The audit of the Schwarz-System has failed on the part of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, remains in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough," said Kala's current situation.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of mispractice, Peter's approach sometimes leads to a so-called dirty system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that GDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not worry businessmen about checking - is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was it?
It means a parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
It is simply that European legislation supports how public procurement should be carried out, national legislation should be followed and applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even if it has not yet been verified, interesting differences have been found: we can simply say that we have legislation that is “exact and unmistakable”, but in practice we are applying some parameters to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to establish more and more detailed rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually, how can this project help you what it means to you?
It is such joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid wealth and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're going to do this by lowering the limit on orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "paper" so that those who want to find lasakes in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been reduced.
You are talking about domestic problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an organization like our CRO (control audit) or does it work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also the Bundesrecunungshof, which is based on our principle, that there is a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, authority to a certain extent is similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal land levels, their system differs somewhat from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal chambers of account.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is there anything more simple than what we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it cannot be said that it is better at all.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Not definitely, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that even sampling countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have benefited from our cooperation with our office, would they?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delays need to be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future verifications - we have started using our new instrument "Finding the Risk of Inefficiency", through which we have launched almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them, and of course, these changes will occur because of the changes in restrictions, changing the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law would benefit or further burden the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will be tightened up” and cannot be complied with.
In the operation of previous regulations, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - regional council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened up in such a way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who wish to seize and abuse but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how can we get out of this situation?
Let's make sure this road doesn't lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that GDP would not worry businessmen about checking the so-called Schwarz system.
The Schwarz system is banned or authorized?
The law should be in any way established and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the authorities that are required to verify and enforce obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and we can solve it," but we can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing happens.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules, as should be formally carried out, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think is not enough.
The roads are slippery, but mainly passable.
In some places the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovara County
This morning in the Karlovar region the roads were passing, but some frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it has to warm up a little during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies on the plains.
However, it is about three inches [30 cm] of snow on the hillsides of the Red Mountains.
The data from local road workers revealed that there was a lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 and the first-class road in the region are currently underway without restrictions.
However, attention needs to be paid, for example, to bridges where the surface can be frozen and collapsible.
All roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are also passable.
But in some of their areas, there are still residues of frozen snow and snow.
Particular attention should be paid to the roads at the heights.
Paradubic and Royal Towns
The Czech Republic's road and highway administration on its website informs that some of the roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, while on the mountain roads and roads situated on the highlands there may be a cloud of snow.
Local road workers warn drivers about famine, which can occur especially at the heights of the Paradubic region.
Gololed can be around Lanschkron, Usti-nad-Orlici, Polički, Svitavi or High Myto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Switzerland are treated by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Giant Mountains and Orlican Mountains.
The skied snow layer is located on the roads at the elevations in the Rihnova-nad-Kneža and Trutnova areas.
In East Czech Republic, a cloudless cloud is changing today.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pulsenian territory
Roads in the Plzeň region are passing this morning, but the places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
Morning cold, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be slick.
The driver’s seats may be exposed to fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Shosse D5 is now practically unrestricted, but road managers are recommending caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and dry surface.
In the southern part of Plzi and Tahov, the frozen areas can fall.
The paths of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in relation to the possibility of collapsing sites.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-used roads in the forest area.
Hollomukese border
The leaders of the highlands of Olomouc today must take into account the snowfall on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards Videl Krisji.
In the night of snowfall, road workers reportedly fell about three centimeters of snow in Schumperke.
In other areas, road borders are usually unrestricted.
"At the heights of the Schumperka lies the remains of the snow.
The leaders who are heading towards Esenika must have in mind the presence of a snow cat in the Red Sea," CAN (Czech News Agency) today reported to the traffic control officer of the Schupperkska.
On the night of the roads, their colleagues from Esenik went out to see that the roads on the highs after chemical treatment remained naked and wet.
Roads are unrestricted in Olomouc, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in forest areas where wet weather remains.
Oral end, Liberian end
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult locations remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several ice-cream or snow-snow locations, a mountain road was closed at the Telnica area of the Clinic in Usteca.
The temperature is also negative in the lows, so there is still snow and ice on the roads. In short, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle East, there are no problems, roads mainly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report a famine in the county.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for his education at night, rain and snow were all day long, and the sky became clear and frozen at night.
Unfavourable conditions were reported on the main road and on track I/13 on the border between the Ustic and Liberian border.
Because of the snowflakes of the trees on the road, they were forced to close the road at the Institute.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to store positive energy
What do you think is going to happen less than a month from now?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people get so easily.
Together with the The Tap Tap group, we are constantly kidding on this topic and we are saying that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the light.
Moreover, in December you're going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about it?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the May calendar, which was announced at 11:10 on 21 December.
On the day before that event, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be started in parallel at 21:00.
They will end, cruelly speaking, at a time when the May calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's got that idea in mind?
Originally, it was my idea, and we've all come up with our artist, González Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to store enough positive energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think with the public about how this world will ever be transferred to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the light. These items can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz and thus support us together.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other musicians, also filled the gym against the end of the light, which is called "The end of the light is cancelled".
Will your favorite YouTube audiences ever sound like they're doing these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if everything is going to work out and the end of the day doesn't come.
All performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gymnasiums will also sound in the direct atmosphere of Czech television.
The words of this song were written and played by Jesus in the clip Tomas Hanak, also participating in Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other people in Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charity events and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many of us like to work, they're interesting.
What's the story of the concert against the end of the light?
For the purchase of equipment for the free education centre STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the Civil Association Tap at the Institute of Edlikka.
Teachers regularly visit students of the Edlikka Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the further construction project of the Edlikka Institute, there will be a separate building in which we will move with the project.
Several music groups and performers will take part in each concert.
What were the criteria for the team?
We have tried to develop a programme that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratesphere and Dana Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi will speak in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will be at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The following year, we would be pleased to introduce ourselves to the Czech National House in New York, and I personally would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
In the face of the border, you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited capabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheels must travel in the luggage office, plus a large number of trucks and tool boxes.
However, the Czech ČSA and British Airways aircraft were always great for us, which surprised me a lot.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with people with disabilities and so on.
What have you been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that we are still at the base level in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and here there is still an independent movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the city centre.
There are also no banal things going on there, such as taking a road with a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people ' s attention to the problems of people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we keep pursuing the advanced countries?
There's a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with severe disability move on their own in the streets, can go into the toilet, into the museum, wherever they may be...
It is not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively participating in public life, in which we with The Tap Tap are a little bit out of control!
Respect for the public or freedom of expression is one thing, but at a time when well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will appear, then everything will really start to change.
As long as it's a single case, it's people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlica Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm also a saxophone player, I've organized an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leader, Lady Angelovic, says, it got a little out of hand.
Well, the popularity has only come in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
That is true, it helped us to join the famous singers and work actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate is actually as if it does not exist.
Through the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did the goal stand before you to unravel The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
The show business is full of things that reflect each other.
This is logical, all new ones are taken with caution, and it takes a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, of course...
But that grief is far too much, because people with limited opportunities are not some suffering and all those who are left behind that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not just for them, it's for the whole society.
Have you succeeded in being a strict leader, as many consider you to be?
If we want to do our work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and have certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to the rehearsals, go to the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are twenty members of the The Tap Tap Group.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
Our doors are always open to those who have the will and will.
It will be held in the day before the expected end of the day, on Thursday, 20.12.2012, at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno - at Fléda and Ostrava Club - in the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected to the telemosto at the time the band The Tap Tap “The end of the light is off”.
The aim of the project is to collect $25 million in funding for the purchase of multi-functional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlikka Institute in Prague.
The ticket to the concert costs 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age, free of charge. Tickets can be purchased in Bohematicket in advance.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to space Poland started much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts had traveled into space, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, which presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 the idea of its innovative work “Introduction into Space”.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience alone, and after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch's "Introduction into spacecraft".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky has become a world-renowned space advocate, and his contribution has been assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the moon has been named in honor of him.
By 1925 a railway station was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should be used to drive or to brake the ball.
The information on this dress is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzyck.
The remaining materials show that the research has come to a stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photo-electric missile was presented in the specialized press by Rogozinski, an engineer, and the following year the work of Léliva-Kžioblocko's "Air Torpedo and Air Bomb" was launched.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Temporary Advisory Committee of the Société Doradço-Saukowa) coordinated all the work before the war itself.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work ended because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonauts appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronauts Society.
For the first time society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which publishes four volumes of articles on astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Sobotovic suggested that a society be organized to deal with cosmonauts.
At the time, artificial satellite projects had already been developed, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and has already become a true member in the fall of POA.
In the following year, POA President Kazimez Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in that position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakeita Meteorologicalzna), which has become the first Polish rocket to conduct a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 tests were conducted in the Bledov Desert in 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do the present scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could exceed 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high winds.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type missile was Meteor-1, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and a primary weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (recorded as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum flight distance for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to extract a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee for COSPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland was involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision led to a lively discussion in society.
There is no doubt that it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, with nothing limited to the movement of private capital together with unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wage) a price tension arises.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, through the delivery of the cheap product, seeks to compete economically with the fact that the value of the competitor is distorted in order to take away most of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means, for most entrepreneurs, either transfer of production abroad or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. This increases unemployment in those countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable costs of the State for social needs are increasing.
Overall, the situation is exacerbating the unwillingness of the employers ' masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they are inflicting on them.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Unscrupulous private capital methods create economies of some States where Governments are forced to compete with one another to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population up to the expense of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to existing legislation.
The goal is to economically force its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as an economic coercion system in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to cut workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty continues to rise, while the gap between the poor and the rich is also widened.
For several years, there has been a public distribution of poor products that are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there have always been cases where employed people receive such wages that the State must pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has become public and in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people suffering from a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to migrate, as in the 19th century, or to exist on a poor payroll in the locks of society, hoping that private investment will ever come into the country.
But where will he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media predominately claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by regulatory actions.
The question is whether private capital, which is now in practice managing politics and the entire State, for its own selfish purposes, should be answered.
One simple answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have an inexhaustible situation of corruption, of mutual benefit, of legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the FRG, the situation is that, due to the lack of financial resources, government ministries are entrusted with the development of draft laws to private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills were then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole authority is not from the people, as the Western Constitution says, but from the financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now rapidly in a situation as described by Appian in the statement "Cess of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long been broken down, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Takeovers, illegal receipt of mercy through stones and swords.
Societies and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with a pre-solded voice"......the ordinary people didn't even get involved in the governor's office, at the end of the day the state once for eight months remained without the consulate....................................................................................................................................................... ......................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................ ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
As in the past, modern society is dominated by its own unreasonable interests, not taking into account public interests.
Private capital is, in fact, no longer intended for public use.
The current result is not different from the past: the excessive fall of the elite without any effort to make reforms of a deeper nature.
That is why we must seek the cause of fascist and communist regimes in the foolish liberalization of economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a certain break, followed by the next tour.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Act on Public Works is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition, both at the international and national levels and at the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social levels of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s left-wing participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in State governance, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and never can come out" is Sting, the song "Chrunky," where the main verse of the referendum is, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," is the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meera Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing that Israel ' s racism, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who was born in these recurring killings as a criminal, and who at the end of the day, the victims, including self-managed Israelis, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses to the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to take a look at the landscape, to see who has been serving above all the tension for the past 95 years (regarding the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
Human history is primarily a history of fighting for power.
In every age we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether someone has been standing behind them who has directed their actions towards the pre-destined goals.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one who could be considered the head of the spleen (I don't know if anyone is over them, but that's not off) - Rotschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first News Agency (Reuters) had bought them in the 1990s to stop hearings linking them to the criminal acts in the highest spheres in which they were located, which always led to their strengthening of power, to the multiplication of wealth or at the same time to the other.
They have large stocks in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in which they do not have their share, lead or prepare war (only 7 countries were in Afghanistan before the invasion, 5 were in Iraq, only four were in the hands of the Russian Government after the invasion of Cadafi, but at the same time the central bank of their country was in the hands of the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the Central Bank of Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war he began to issue his own (governmental) money and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to bring the Fed to trial for the outbreak of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars created by the great Mason at the 33rd level of Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial rule, especially Britain, and the third had to lead to a reduction in the world population of about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to provide their comfort and light, and they would not need many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the ultimate occupation of absolute authority.
The method used by the group of the richest families in the head with the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal for solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED's foundation, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unravel World War I through the killing of the Habsburg heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, starting with a more vengeful revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarranted in the military and economic sense of capitalization of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, broke down the Central European Power, Austria and Hungary.
In order to facilitate the release of World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military repairs on Germany, as a prerequisite for the radicalization of the lunches, and then only the Germans were left to throw a strong enough, guilty and simple solution to the leader, to continue to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and actually played the function of the fifth pillar in the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothsilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, desirable in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfura Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first encounters with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had been expelled from the chains where he was originally held by the bankers, or anything he had done, had been planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created prerequisites for the recognition of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany had been provoked by military repairs to World War II, the State of Israel had been declared to be the cornerstone of the third war.
If the international bankers were able to untie it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, would become victims of frontal hostilities, now together with the Arab or, simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the strict separation of people from Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the plague brings insults to the endless chain of violence if it all starts with the desire of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, international bankers are urging people to vote in elections exclusively of their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician who is doing everything in his power to start war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a global conflict, and taking into account Iran's control of the Ormuz River, which contains 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the sea corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the harshest of financial aristocracy, which enjoys comfort.
A world where every birth-born organism is implanted into a chip with which it becomes a substance under total control.
And he causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, to have on their right hand or on their foreheads a stick, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of his name may not sell it.
That is wisdom. Whoever has reason can calculate the number of animals.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Argo Operation" movie: When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist Protestant students occupied the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomat hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for the torn-off Shah of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration was not expected to have a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw chess on board because this could undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not possible.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Irian attitudes at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Afflek "Argo Operation" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought small victories to America.
Shortly before the embassy occupation, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult time, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagance cover legend that they went through Canadian passports as members of a so-called group that searched for a place in the country for a science-fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by an expert on "evacuation" by Tony Mendes, called for the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend reliable, the specialized journals have written about the film project, a press conference was held that the manufacturing company invented had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afleka's movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, so called a film-cinopopus, has a history of success, and the affair can be an example of a number of films about Owen's friends.
The film is constantly changing attitudes - on the one hand, documentaryly thought-out scenes from Tehran (the titles show signs of historical events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no major differences in this).
On the other hand, the Hollywood cracks are relieved of ironic and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, the men in the costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the institution's stairs, on the phone...
Ben Aflek has made a wonderful start to his career.
The funny actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Forgive, baby, forgive" (2007) and the trailer "The City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Afleka, which is not filmed in the hometown of director Boston.
The atmosphere of the site is related to qualities that have elevated earlier filmmakers over the Hollywood standard.
And Aflek shows it in Argo, where Tegeran plays Canada.
The brighter scenes in the film take place on the streets, when real events are being reconstructed, the opening scenes of the embassy fall impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of the path and the unpredictableness that arise when history suddenly changes.
The similar effect of Aflek and his colleagues is achieved on the stage of the invented (separate headquarters in the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that reproduction did not imply a large number of scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's pretty successful with this little thing, and sometimes he's thinking something -- it's not so elegant out there -- (the scene where the phone call in America prevents the raging crisis at Tegeran airport, and the chases on the field seem quite thoughtful).
The lack of Argo is a dissatisfaction with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really very promising as Hollywood colleagues, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from unique in the film.
The Afleka film is not enough dramatism, it is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing the setting and retro-style that restores the thrillers of the seventy.
But he's got a hard time.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a familiar sense of living history, as well as to demonstrate how the perceptions of the almighty and all-knowing species are exaggerated.
Airballs, bananas and circuses
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank collections, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd order or project from the Master's EU”.
"We have been moved to this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said the author of the "Law" questionnaire, Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already raised, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to pool the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had the benefits of life insurance because they are at less risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the master's EU people can compete by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place by the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU's contested orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which causes damage to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which has significantly affected the eggs this year.
Criticism has also been effectively prohibited from the use of the term "butterbrown oil" or from the sale of classical lamps.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often provides a solution under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (this is how the Czech Republic now opposes the demands of its banks even at the risk of the vote).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have been "anomaly curved".
However, the European Commission was justified in harmonizing only existing divergent national rules that made trade more difficult.
Despite the resistance of some States, the EU has nevertheless softened the standards of fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives will lead to product distribution.
The candidate for the prize in the survey may also be the last year's EU rule that salesmen must provide a warning that children under eight years of age cannot push them away without the supervision of adults.
The EU has addressed American studies that suggest that slots are the potential cause of the death of children by drowning.
Such a restriction is now applicable to children under 14 years of age who are prohibited from diving in fermoral duvets.
Fun ideas are born at home
It is absurd enough that the rule relating to the European officials themselves: everyone who has an official EU position cannot use the name of Macedonia, taking into account the delicateness of the topic for Greece, but should instead say "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com Portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, has proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the quantity of preserved mushrooms, which was threatened by a fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for having no sea and the idea of granting grants to receive grants.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
Let's ask for compensation from the European Union," said then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CHPD) in October 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain and that the so-called intervention purchases had full stocks of stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies to receive the grant were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such grants had to be made for grants from Brussels.
EU: Extraordinary provisions are an exception
While Member States' regulations are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more efficient functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe, deserve recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the withdrawal of EU grants for projects that do not even intend to have something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have succeeded in discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, as in other countries of the European Union, and not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians have retained the name "Lomoukski sirks", the "Twice Rom" whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Twicemak".
It can only be called rom products from the cane distillate rather than from the sugarcane.
The official list of EU registered products, along with the world-renowned "fat" and "gorgongzola", a marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parm Vetchen, has already proved to be, for example, carnivorous droughts, peas and peas and peas.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of the perdubic plumber and the fertilized pipes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm a lover, Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get himself into a fight at the president's office?
I don't think I'm going to be a senator or president.
If we had everything going well in the country, I wouldn't be messing around.
But I can no longer see how in the last 20 years the country has been torn apart, how the enemies are being torn apart, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I didn't have an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been 40 years old and I'm an independent person who's not a party, I have no other chance to influence things than to compete with the senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential castle.
Will you not turn your backs to the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected senator, I'd be fighting against the presidents.
My goal is not a post, it is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and powers.
But it's not only the difficulty that we're like a nation that's rocking at our bar or TV, but we're willing to dissolve anyone who's trying to change something.
In addition, the media that misrepresents people and that loses freedom of speech with freedom of lie is added.
For example, I was told that I was taking the press or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroubek.
Let's go to your views.
You have begun the fight for the presidential castle with a report on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on the backlog of property statements of over twenty million.
In order to implement this, it is necessary to amend the law.
You have no such authority as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, lobbying for the excursions to become a free enterprise was a step forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good suggestion to the left or to the right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this hinders citizens.
As an independent and impartial person, I have far greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what's best for our country, and apply it, without being party-based.
You think you're more of a man on the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm being treated rather to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not that someone is on the right, and someone on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society, whether it will be proposed by the CDC or by the GDP, and I will be against the bad idea.
You'll get angry when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
It can be called populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or are being talked about by well-known experts.
But without Parliament's support, you'll be left with nothing but slogans.
And that's not gonna last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out with people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on our side so that we can succeed.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast in which I would appeal to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to report why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that causes abuse, there will be pressure on the political scene.
Take the President's direct election, it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying that I'm a lover, not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just beginning politics, and for my programme I am trying to get the support of the majority.
I am trying to make progress on my own; if this fails, six years will come to an end and I will return to the private sector.
It's partly like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything, so I've passed a number of famous people with a proposal to fight in the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he gave up a lot of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigation by journalist Jan Lawrence, who discovered fraud with light petroleum products.
I applied because people are really unhappy, but now I feel weighed down.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the election, but most of those who went to the election of representatives of the building.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that the changes would take place with difficulty.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have the money.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account, only $20,000.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property statements, and how are your own business going with it?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection of approximately 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Skoda Superb for a million, and a few more millions per account.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up to me because it was my little dream - I always liked James Bond, who was riding the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against dishonesty and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property, and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign out of my pocket.
The costs of the campaign will actually cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be messing around.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut this?
But that doesn't depend on the amount of pay.
As I promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, the director of the tourist agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, did you get used to it every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were president, I would finish my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's "Right" issue.
The architects of MVRDV prove that these adventures are not only imagined - for example, Speikenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of the big company, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going into such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Speikenisse, a notable sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this annoying situation a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to common education and to build seven well-designed bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of illustrative railway miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance to resist statistics — to build a library here!
Wines Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, master of bold columned diagrams and author of powerful, sometimes even cynical buildings, dealt with the task of their usual impatience and appeared at a competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and facial abstinence.
And while members of the jury were looking closely at and holding their shoulders, Maas, from his original gift, put a pyramid of size and ended up defending his project with the words: "Dear citizens!"
That's what I'm suggesting: "The Book Mountain" in Spikenisse, so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain was worth 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, almost and several adjacent homes and tunnels in a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Luxe Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national competition for timber.
Thus, an impersonal award that had previously been unable to offer nothing but a postmodernist pedestrian zone and a wonderfully beautiful rattuque, whose white facades were thought to be a dairy plant, has become richer in one modern architecture.
But the most important thing is that in Spakeniss was the first public cultural building in the history of this town.
A Long Road to a Book
First impression: The book Eldorado under a cheese cup.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain mass, for the present worshippers of architecture and reading prefer to explore this location by foot.
The bright and easy-to-see room, the fields of a sacred brick and the elegant street lights are undoubtedly a feeling of public urban space.
The urban environment has been restored perfectly.
It's not easy to look for comics, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
“The bookshelfs usually stand next to the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually impenetrable and impenetrable,” says Vini Maas.
We've put a classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the reading area from the outside.
The interior space of the book mountain is well used: offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and technical facilities are located in the centre.
In particular, black bookshelfs are happy to serve as walls, parapets, and walkstones.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers are lost in speculation, which is for unknown material.
"We have sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Spikeniss community, in accordance with the standard requirements.
And once on one farm in Freeland, we met the right side product of agriculture.
For many years the artificial fibre material of millimeters of thickness has been used as a base in the warmers and fields of the Netherlands.
It's cheap and saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in such quantities, was pressed into a four - inch - thick panel.
Under the heat and pressure, the so-called landauplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, uniform, solid material with a slightly recalling new car and a little cross-section.
There's 105 degrees to the top.
Anyone who crosses the road nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in literary coffee not only with fantastic city views but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs for a New Soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an ecological model project," says Trouborst.
The ground temperature is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass lid, even in clear days the sun only falls within for a short time.
Large wooden farms, which are perpendicular to glass facades, provide shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is fully automatic.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaig was here too.
As well as Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg a "soul of Spachenisse, which has long been missing".
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each person received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books had to be filled with empty spaces on the shelves of a library that had not yet been fully completed, at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are placed on the top.
"Nothing is worse than a library," says the architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every individual now has some kind of connection to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV was able to solve the royal task, which in the professional jargon is called the creation of an identity.
Spiekenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first realized that it would vote against the Palestinians ' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wished to demonstrate its independence, while not speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in voting on the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
NATO finally made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The issue is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from a policy that has been governed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent common policy among Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again placed between the two fronts.
They were expected to play a more independent role, but they were not used to it.
I think that as long as they only play their part, they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such an external policy, carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
This is a willingness to take a position in national interest, whether independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ considerably from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give that too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, this plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as it was in the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will gain some respect.
For this signals that it should be taken seriously as a game in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly expressed.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in view of the local political situation, of course, the Government cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that substantial differences in opinion are not as important as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyah, note that Obama is not at all in the dark of Netanyah's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little simpler if there was a single, non-opposing European policy, but it is not now.
Therefore, they cannot speak within a broader approach and are forced to act instead on the basis of their own vision.
That's how they deal with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in establishing a common European position.
It is understandable that it is not easy for Germany, even if it is due to relations with Israel.
This subject has always been scrupulous.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take on a truly important role?
Or is Germany still playing a major role?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, and it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, there are the most diverse anti-German feelings.
Germans don't just deal with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It must take into account the different neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
Thus, the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you don't like it, it's not like it or it's not like it.

“Protection of trade marks” in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a fully officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a claim.
But it is still unclear whether they will be able to stand up for their rights.
"Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloh, Taylor Wessing's lawyer, who specializes in violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East.
There's a new kind of thing on my desk every week.
The simulators are sufficient to add a few letters to obtain the right to register their trade marks.
Thus, from Gucci, Lu-Gucci is obtained, and Prada can be registered as Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied in the same way.
The patch opens a folder with records of the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zigna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also used the name of the modern house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are champions of the world to copy and violate intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are numerous universities that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloha's case is not the case, and on the orders of his creditors, he advocates that Chinese companies be given the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", the passenger brand.
That word is associated with the "Ban Daquan."
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not acknowledge guilt
"It harms business, it must be fought," said Pattloh.
"The trade mark fades, the unique situation loses, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to CLSA market research company, China, with a sales volume of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, it is difficult to get rid of questionable entries in the trade mark register, and it is expensive.
The process may take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court rejected the claim, as, after a long period of time, the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff doesn't, he'll even have to pay the plagiarism because he's damaged his trade mark in China, Pattloh says.
Sometimes there's a jungle law here.
There are also well-known cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, a company that had recently acquired a concrete manufacturer of Putzmeister.
Thus far, the Chinese have the right to use the Mercedes-like symbol.
The buying Volvo Geely initially used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost copyists from Hong Kong and Singapore in China, where the famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of personnel and equipment.
But last year, there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to normal”.
Thus, the number of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still pending production in the Office.
Fighting this is worth it
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade mark protection applications were made to CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has managed the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time, the agency reports.
The same applies to the total number of actual trade marks, only 5.5 million items.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration is equal to an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth a lot more to protest, as Freudenberg’s German family business shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to achieve that their illicit production of counterfeit car details had been eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights for the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own loss, as the German surnames were not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Board in Munich.
And the registration of the trademarks of CTMO has rejected the claim of the Munichers.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing party continues to fight so far.
There's got to be a beginning.
The question is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could hardly be taken into account, the company ' s archives had to be reviewed even centuries ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg without result proposed a "large six-digit euro sum" to the opposite side for a settlement.
"It's clear how much it costs us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to shift even to Europe.
That is the case where the simulators register unprotected trade marks.
Thus, a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for leather shoes and articles.
The Group has long ceased its production in these areas, but despite this it has been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be a waiter," says Ventcler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, and it is more likely that foreigners should “all that is to be protected in any way, also to be registered in China”, says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses its trade mark drama in the last act, he will have to pay the opposite party licence fees for his own name, explains Ventcler.
Otherwise, we're being pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus is repeated, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted to do so.
The history of relations that have surpassed more than 8733 kilometres.
At first, the sinking takes place: cowboy mushrooms, basketball crusades, ladies' ice creams and men's dolls pick a tat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Two-three-four.
Only after that do the voices of the singers grow slowly — the altar, bass, tenor, and soprano — they come in, delight and follow each other.
And Pete Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, doesn't jump out of her mother's shoes when she wears them with soft and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelbergh Choir Imbongi repeats a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetics experts to courtrooms.
Om "Om "Obani" is an inconvenient thing, every voice of people has their own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme is estimated to have some 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 orphans live in AIDS.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitženi, the Voices for Africa association found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
They don't talk about running a gang in this room, so they can sing.
Almost ten years of researching songs in this foreign tongue, and from time to time, it even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
Because 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voices of German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were missing parents who died of HI virus.
In Esitgeni, the disease is reflected in the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The cutting of the extremities of males, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost unacceptable among the population.
More than forty per cent of Swaziland ' s population are infected with immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the tenth is not rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but Imbogni had seen many children on the streets not only of parental care but also of food, clothing, education.
Without school education in the poor country, there is no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants to send the child to school for several euros a year and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the Voices for Africa association was founded, which has since been professionally concerned about AIDS orphans in Esitženi.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial HICPs include syphilis, chlamydiasis and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viruses of the IPR.
Pediculosis and frequency are the parasitic IPR.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly met by men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adult patients with frequent sexually transmitted diseases have Chlamydia infections, trichomonosis, candidiasis (greypox), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koha Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms suggest a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases, genital ulcers, urinary complaints, excretions, lower pain, and blisters or dizziness may occur.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can we protect ourselves?
Preservatives are able to reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
For, in part, sexually transmitted diseases may also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular surveys, especially when sexual partners are often replaced.
Early diagnosis can cure the majority of IPRs and avoid remote consequences.
Leadership, donations and not, in the end, fees for people all over Germany allow for something to be gathered.
"We've already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitženi," said Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the very village of Germany, there is a code of Dlamina, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care of the welfare of orphans, such as one of the grandparents.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the village's base.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care of children in the form of daily lessons.
Those who do not have a family come to the home of the Hanesil, the only woman who receives a salary from the union, as well as two bribes that each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the Voices for Africa association organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, and, together with the American Health Organization, organized HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country is preferable to remain silent.
King with 14 Women
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Msvati III, is known for his love of heritage.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the lifestyle of such a State is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HI virus in recent years.
But it's also on boat workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni's chorus every two to three years travels to South Africa and sings songs, complete boobs, military spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many in the southern part of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing songs in black, not only gives a good feeling and joy, but even has caused tears in the eyes of harsh frontiers.
The trip is always also taking to Esitženi, where the singers visit the underprivileged children.
Although a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, it is more known in the Eculven Valley.
"Go to Esithen, there's the world," the people here say.
And after 8733 kilometers of flight back to Haidelberg, when the warm singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, it can be seen that this light is also hot here.
Messenger: NASA opening Mercury ice
Zond "Messenger" found evidence that planet Mercury had ice.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency of NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by the three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
Zond "Messenger" found evidence that the permanent shadow region of the planet would be covered by ice.
Its thickness shall be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres.
The water is supposed to come from comets or possibly asteroids that have encountered Mercury.
No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, says science director of Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help explain how the water and other building elements of life had moved to other locations in the solar system.
Notable to the inhabitants of the Earth are the senses, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, which explore the depth of the universe.
From time to time, they are sending pictures to the earth: tiny eyes in endless ranges.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the girl planet of Cerera.
Like Pluto, who is talking about the Sun after Neptune, Cerera, as a new definition of the international astronomical Union since 2006, is not “planned”.
This fragment of the infrared image of the telescope "Spitzer" represents the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, the most difficult to identify in the star circle the pink "born" stars.
This region of star formation -- scientists call it W5 -- is an open telescope "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This translucent dying star photographed NASA's Spitzer telescope.
It looks like a doll is made up of a material which the star has released in the process of dying.
In the gigantic darkness of Triphid, which has been removed for 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars emerge from the gas and dust.
NASA Telescope "Spitzer" took this photo of the Galactic Birth Hall.
Pleiade's constellation, also called "Seven Sisters", can be seen by an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, color telescopes do better.
As a red-eye, the Ulitch's fog in this infrared image is moving the observer.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the star of Vodolei.
Similar to the earth's continent, this fog has brought the name "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive coloring.
This new star has only been photographed with the use of the Spitzer infrared sensors.
Saturn and his ring: How they emerged is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's the statue of Saturn's moon, which disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Aquavorot galaxy
Depending on the color transfer of the photo of spiral galaxies, they are now made of art.
The photographs published by the European Southern Observatory show the distance of the darkness of Trifid in the constellation of the Shooter for a few thousand light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (triangular, triangular), since dark strips of dust are divided into three parts of the broken heart of the star.
Astrologers photographed in the constellation of the Astrologer: 400 million years away from the Earth, the cores of the two merging galaxies come together and will inevitably come together.
This was the birth of the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
A person who does not like technical reductions may call it "South Tube Wheel".
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows the fragment of Iris' darkness in the star Cephey.
The darkness, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of particles of dust, the size of which is 10 to 100 times lower than that of the usual household dust.
This image was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
More spiral galaxies are called UGC 1810.
This starry fog is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star sphere is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, which is associated with the darkness of Rosetka, is also constantly creating new stars at the distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
There's still no gas in this bright, bright galaxy with a small black hole.
Researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Great Explosion when the Universe was essentially hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have become more and more visible, and their view of space has become ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each diameter of 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The Great South African Telescope mirror is segmented in South Africa to reduce cost.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about ten feet [11 m].
Lack of low design: the telescope is firmly anchored under a vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality: high luminous capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Participating in the “External Intelligence Search” project (SETI), any owner of the computer can help by providing his computing power.
Type of European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in Chilean Andean.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" here. It's completely in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow the display of even the average infrared spectrum.
The ESO in Chile also plans to install a European "Very Large Telescope".
Its main mirror should be broken down by 42 meters and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors.
However, the photograph should be expected not earlier than 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the world's largest.
They have two mirrors of ten metres in diameter.
Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of Supera and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a mirror diameter of 30 metres is to be found in Mauna Kea.
They can love illustrations here.
However, the most important species in space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has been providing pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photos show the latest Kepler Space Telescope preparations.
The space telescope James Webba (JWST) will be launched into space not earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Great Explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the southern shelf of Mercury.
There is no reliable data, however, since "Messenger" is heading closer to the planet's north pole.
Radiation measurements over the decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the 2004 "Messenger" sentence, the first to return to Mercury, scientists are now convinced of this.
Sing the oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age.
There's even a museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Biblical age.
There's even a museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talas Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with a thunderstorm runs along a rough road beyond the dense woods of hills, storms, and simple Christian homes.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost border of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few miles away.
The Talas live here, one of the Caucasian peoples, who knows a little about it, is only what they speak beautifully in the Persian and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by their longevity.
The final item is Lerick.
The small town is built on too heavy a Soviet-time architecture, which does not entirely harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost don't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
Three miles [323 km] is eight hours away because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth the country owes to the Caspian Sea, here in the province until it has reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is nothing in Lerick to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the world's older people," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Long Ages, probably the only one in the world.
There is a biography documented about eight dozen of these places, over 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At 136 years of age, he had another child
But the museum's controversial star is the Shirali Muslim skull, which is probably 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, do not.
In view of the fact that the older person whose age has been confirmed by documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslim seems to be extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at 136 years of age, he claimed to have been born a daughter.
Did this add the Muslim skull to its age for a few decades?
For even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher at the Max Plank Institute in Rostock, heard about debtors in Central Asia.
“Many of the elderly can also meet in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “and very very old people also live in Sardinia.”
However, because of the lack of documents, it is impossible to confirm age because there were no civil records.
Each day, a bottle of hot butter
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the area of Lerick have been strikingly early in their lives.
Now 20 people live here for over 100 years.
Why here, south, so many debtors?
Farid Mugimzade, an Azerbaijani tour guide, explains this by special Talash genes.
The director of Fatulaeva's museum, on the contrary, believes it's about food.
Tales like meat, bread, and most of the milk products, many of them drink on a bottle of hot butter every day. However, this high-calorie diet can hardly be healthy from a dietary point of view.
In Chengemer, a small settlement near the town of Lerick, Rubab Mirzoev.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these ranges.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bottle of olive oil that she's never gonna be able to stay here.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one son and daughter of Mirza, who have long had their grandchildren.
And closeness will also jump two little ones.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea, which is supplied in typical pans of the Armoudo.
In Mirza's ideally smooth and strong white teeth, the main plate is to protect the long dark Russian hair that her son proudly spreads before us.
I've always had my hair in milk, so they never got out and kept a color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what was grown in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, nuts.
For the rest of my life, I never bought any products at the store.
Then she relates about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it got better when the "loved father" Geidar Aliev got in the lead.
Propaganda does not often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of a nation that rules the country as a dictator has virtually no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham was adopted by the Board of Governors.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension for 230 months (approximately the same amount of euro) and for local conditions it is the amount that can be well lived.
And perhaps the long grown-up son of Mirzaev also has the right to say, "The old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, caring, and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo show a deep disunity in the country.
The future Sharia-based constitution has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian President did not collect on the Paphos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success lies in my responsibility before the people and God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian dignitaries, liberals, educated Muslims and non - religious Egyptians.
Indeed, all those who have been left in despair to this day are filled with fear of the Last Day.
Fear of a religious State in the Nile for the mercy of powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohammed Morsi, if you don't apologize, said that he temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction to save the revolution.
However, the fact is that a 61-year-old engineer with a doctor at the University of South California in the United States does not really want to save the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be extended in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamic-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this was partly a cause of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it could be feared that Islamists would use the vague language and the resulting legal air for a more strict interpretation of the Shariah.
At least one new article suggests this: in all Sharia cases, al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of a country with greater authority in all Sunni Islam should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are monitoring the legislation, that the de facto would result in a limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, many are subject to interpretation
Another problem is that the civil liability of the military court should remain.
These courts were used during the Mubarak period to oppress the opposition.
After the dictator's arrest, there were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morality and values”.
Legally, this is so unclear that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
No article at all establishes direct equality between men and women.
There is no harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, nor is there any harm in it, except that Allah is Most Gracious.
But what such an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that there is a phrase that is prohibited from "injuring people " .
Is there enough cartoons on the president or jokes about the lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project that Morsi proposes for signature and which he said would be presented to the Egyptians “very soon”.
"The Revolution Is Back"
Opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been formed for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed El-Baradei said that the draft constitution was “a weakness of history”.
Through short news on Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead the "path against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his castle and take it off," said oppositionman Jasser Sayid.
"We have not yet stopped, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to follow the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brothers, in turn, called for a protest, but with caution, not at Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the roofs and by the Salafites, who shouted: “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They demanded Mursi to clean up the country, and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The fight for power over the symbolic area that all began sparked the situation of the practical civil war.
The Morsi followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
Muslims stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to allow the people to decide at the polling station which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered a matter of decision.
"The concept of "human rights" is not mentioned at all"
Abu Saed's Hafiz is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have been extended until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) protected the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or brought before the court at Mubaraka.
Not because he shared their view of peace, but because human rights were not shared for him.
That's why he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in a new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures constitute a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto canceled it,” says Sayeda.
For democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of the direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could be a payoff.
The protester on Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian Raffic: the stupidest fish in the world?
The five million people of Norway have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of this country's success have something to do with local passion for an extremely malicious fishing vessel?
Take a few ripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and dirty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a falsifying smell of raffia -- one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but it's an inexhaustible smell in the air.
Racfisk is a forel that is salty and boiled in water before a year, depending on what person needs to achieve.
As the summers collapse and colds, the crowds of Norwegians gather at a festival in Fagernes, which is about the same, to say so, to the captivating audience.
"She eats raw and drinks with a bucket of water, a local dark water," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fire department and a "raffic general" in charge of the festival.
People all around us eat fish with small cubes and drink it with small portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes the aquarium more than the raffick," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not as bad as it is, it's a little different from the dry portion you've been on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, before the colders appeared, the fish were wrapped in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then, in a deep winter, when the fish was well and thoroughly boiled, it was extracted and swallowed by alcohol.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13 per cent of the population is immigrant, with jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The residents of Sweden (the former rival and not so long ago and much more lively neighbor) come here to work.
Racfisk is perceived as some important symbol, unchanged, though a few malicious elements of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local sights.
On the other hand, here all the expensive little bottle of beer or sandwiches will cost you 9 pounds of sterlings ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the country ' s inhabitants seem to have done so.
People here have so far been reluctant to mention the name Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist, who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “the 22nd of July”.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace - loving country one of their citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and murder.
Norway ' s current prosperity is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventy) in one of the world ' s largest oil industries.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, who is wearing a long-lasting raffia, a woman with long bright hair and striking blue eyes, adding Nordic well-being.
We are only a people who judge according to what you call them.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like to show off, we're not proud.
Norway is very cautious about its oil, most of which is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they didn't have was wasted, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
"As long as you can walk on the ice and walk in the summer, that's enough for you to be happy," says Anna.
"And there's a raffick," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow looking for some kind of food.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat. It's exactly exotic, delicious soda meat.
But tonight we expect even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
There is a special meal at my hotel about the Raffish, during which the visitors by vote determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a straight-air TV showing the leader in the poppy bag, surrounded by a raffle.
It's like a Eurovision song competition.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what was your estimate of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and cheers.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking over the aquarium.
Or maybe just smelling like that fish.
Mexico President Enrique Penya Nieto is going to be a difficult career start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, is ready to join the post, the BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to consider the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Road traffic in Mexico now is particularly distressing.
The city was overloaded with transportation and at the best of the time, and on Monday, steel fences were built that cut several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the payroll, but to prevent protestors from getting to the Parliament building.
The new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Neeto, will give a presidential conveyance and take the beards of government by the country on Sunday.
He is faced with a challenge that is not easy to face.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance at the Felipe Kalderon administration, which is now in power, but the country has fallen into the war on drugs, which has already brought about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government is telling the people of Mexico about its willingness to fight violence," Mr. Penya Neeto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week at the White House's Oval Office.
I intend to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements by the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Penya Nieto developed in the position of governor of his country of Mexico.
In his family, in a densely populated and large state surrounding the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
Primoline person
In the idyllic town of Vale-de-Bravo, for example, it is mentioned with warmth.
The residents deserve the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto, who are clearly different from the road with the blasts and pits that had been in this place before.
The tables with its name depend on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We hope for real and serious changes with him”, said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Ernandes, Congressman of the state of the Head of Penja Neeto Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the current and decisive changes that our country needs so urgently, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay by the PRI party, Visente Foxes was expelled in 2000.
Congressman Olver acknowledged that, following his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party had high hopes for Enrique Penya Nieto.
He also rejected the allegations of incompetence that had brought opposition to the new President.
He is very direct and very committed to the fulfillment of his vision of the future country.
This is an outstanding public figure, and above all, a person capable of listening.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as Sudad-Nez, is the most striking contrast to the powerful streets of Vale-de-Bravo.
Hidden under the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in nature of this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops had been deployed to humiliate drug-trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women was particularly acute here.
A few dozen bodies of murdered women have been discovered in the desert near a large shed in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the reign of Mr. Penya Nieto - this is much more than a point in the tragic violence of the city of Ciudad Huarez, whose name has become apparent when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Penja Nieto, he was best known for his failure to deal with the issue of the murder of women during his governorship.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A concrete house, like most of the houses in this surrounded area, Irina Bundia is hard to stop crying, showing me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family felt that her roommate had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body was washed before that," recalls Mrs. Bundia.
There were signs of her being killed, and the body was already surrounded.
Mariana’s mother tells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs up with a gap on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they say the family was denied.
"The officials of the state treated me like an old police station, a disgruntled offender.
They want people just to believe everything they say and to shrink.
But it's wrong, so it's not possible, especially when there's so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
The President, Penya Neeto, will take on a difficult responsibility with her on Saturday.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by crimes of violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor," says Olver, a conventioner from Vale de Bravo from PRI.
However, this is the most feared family of victims in the city of Sudad Nes.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, attention was paid to Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that a number of Bradley Manning, accused of a major leak of classified materials in U.S. history, had not taken advantage of the many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment, which he said had to be carried away while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort-Midde, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the records of Manning's weekly visits to the prison administration within nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination of Manning ' s application for protection on the ground that the terms of his detention were cruel and that he himself had had sufficient punishment was carried out the next day after Manning said he was under arrest and intended to commit suicide.
The military intelligence expert, arrested in June 2010, is charged with kidnapping several thousand secret documents during Iraq's service.
These materials were subsequently published on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the information source was Manning.
During his Friday hearing, prosecutor Feyn and Manning reviewed reports that had been filled since his visit to Manninga by representatives of the Administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was in strict prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked questions to Manningu and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he valued the treatment of the prison administration as “superior” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manninga was directly asking about the conditions of his detention, Faine claims.
Manning replied that he had voiced concern about these problems and that his administration representatives had discussed these issues with him and said that they would, but had not fixed it in writing.
"They wrote "problems are missing" (after my complaints were discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in the discussion," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his wrongful treatment in January 2011 at a meeting of the suicide commission, which he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be able to remove the “traumatic warning” regime from him and mitigated the conditions of detention.
Military leaders explained that a restricted detention regime - at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect prisoners and for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that it was all right with me to cancel the trauma prevention regime... to improve my standard of living, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a military-marriage prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness because of a strong heat.
He explained that it is very difficult psychologically when you are not let to know how you are involved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world ran down to Camp Aryan base, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small room at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day in full loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only his mattress, clothes, sneakers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because sleeping or even lying on the ground was forbidden.
According to Manning, in his sleep, he had a constant light that penetrated the camera outside.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was back in bed at night, they said he was awake and had him turn his back.
Counsel Manning objected to the wrong treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenwart, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during the testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep in his Quantico chamber, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning said he could not hide his clothes during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a suit that he could cover, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it away.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was made naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use a trimming of rabbits or elephants to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his lower whites, his capes and his eyes were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to survive during his detention and would significantly reduce the time limit for detention if Manning was found guilty by the military court, which should begin his trial at the beginning of next year.
The Defence stated that it was planned to invite Manning to acknowledge guilt for less serious crimes and other charges to challenge them as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is planned for these departures, and it is expected that the accused party will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of prisoners with the most strict regime.
Among the charges brought against Manning, there is a subsidiary of the opponent, the illegal promotion of Internet data, the transfer of national defence information, and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be threatened with a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of self-reliance.
The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the difficult times in the country.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are fragmented between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the incoming corridor, got close to the border control area, and stopped on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicans (Mexicans), the other for Foreigners (foreigners).
I was standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like what my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican descent".
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the people who speak the language, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and I'm fine for Foreigners.
I recalled this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda contained common issues for the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nieto was willing to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which now has the same success for Mexicans to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wanted to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create some North American trading bloc like the Euro Union.
In addition, President Penya Nieto promised to continue the war against drug addicts in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders under the guise of a gun to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events all over.
Therefore, it is only for some U.S. public figure to complain at least about criticism from Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society that complaints are being made about the fact that Americans are affecting the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with warfare.
Mexico has the most difficult relationship with over 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about the insults?
Enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type, poorly educated, from poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
They see it differently in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the fulfillment of the American dream, we have been taught in good schools and built on good work, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country we consider to be.
United States of America.
We also know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not love us.
We answer the same question.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as the people of the second class as the unexplained Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Only our existence is due to their failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be on the loose, finding a lifelong life in the United States, but losing our spiritual relationship.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are some tensions between Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans have a clear understanding of their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin hate it.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that both countries belong.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we also like Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best out of two worlds, you're inevitably losing your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my visit, as if our relations were not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intelligence officials wanted to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican embassies and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too much trouble in the past.
In view of the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but understand that yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they treated Mexico half a century ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by the recent dealings with their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Please, we have more general than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Can there be a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
A major round of bloodshed underscores the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are ordinary, pointless disputes about who started; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time during the conflict, rockets from the Gaza Strip fell into the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians were hopelessly bound up in their eternal conflict, the Middle East had changed.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring surrounded many of the enduring realities in the storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis were unable to stay away from the ravages of the shaken region.
Perhaps their fight will be even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope that the death penalty will come.
War Without Winners
First of all, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, would be carried out, the clashes this week only strengthened the positions of the rapists on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said that they had forced Israel to resign despite their losses.
Although some group leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million people were trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel had not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can fully conclude that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grew, Hamas had new influential and rich friends.
The rising regional leader of Turkey, who was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The trading supporters of Hamas claim to establish an Islamic semi-monthly Israeli circle - from Lebanon to northern Lebanon, where the Hezbollah military group is headed, to Syria, where more and more pro-Islamic rebels are being defeated by Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the regional balance of forces occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened with President Muhammad Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was defeated in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas' support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization, much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic situations, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hotline in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was indicted.
The Israeli missile system, the Iron Dome, justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully for at least some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Benjamin Netanyah, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although about 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets released from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of deadly terrorists, partly through a wall that enters the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan, a large part of an unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the perspective of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, was united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigail Liberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of creating and giving Palestinians their own State?
If they were to give all power to them in the West Bank territory, wouldn't they start launching rockets from there on the side of Israel, as their fellows in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and press hard any attempt to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hotline supporters will win; however, their calculations may be rejected in the Arab spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not warmer to Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence part of Israel ' s budget is more than all of its Arab neighbours, taken together.
Disengagement of war with the regional superpowers is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
At least Israel should take into account the long-term implications of its policy.
As democratic change occurs in Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians ' right to self-determination is a bomb of delayed action which will explode early or late in the territories occupied by Israel, such as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already undermined the basis of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - is only exacerbating these problems.
The growing dissatisfaction of the international community is due to blood flow operations carried out every few years in the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement.
Both sides need an external impulse
There remains the only solution that health-care representatives from both sides and most of the rest of the world and our newspaper have repeatedly called for: the formation of two States and the accession of Israel to the territories for security.
There is still hope, which is not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective impact on the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which has long been decided to cover the arms supply in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have, as never, a positive position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than a future UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama must also play his role in establishing Israel as a negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace settlement plan.
After his return to the White House, he continued to show an unwillingness to join in addressing the problem.
It's a catastrophicly unparalleled position.
The United States has a vital interest in the stability of the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Unified Packing Act for Cigarettes has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings about the damage to smoking and the image of the affected parts of the body are contrasted in green boxes, which are the same for all marks of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force in the world, replacing the logos and colouring of different brands with the same oil-colored box with yellow images of the diseased parts of the body and images of children whose health was undermined by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning against smoking, the only difference between packages imposed on this Saturday is the name of the marks printed with the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, excluding this harmful habit of fashion.
Such a decision was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking under the age of 26 never become smokers in 99 cases out of 100.
“It is obvious that even at a young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to bring in by using packaging,” explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersec, referring to the research that has shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world ' s least-smokers countries, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of such measures is already being considered by other countries.
The tobacco industry ' s representatives strongly opposed the adoption of the Act.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences that are different from those that were designed by its initiators," says Scott McKintir, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone footwear that conceals unpleasant pictures on the packaging grew sharply (in practice from zero) since two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in Australia's High Court, where they tried to challenge this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already made about six thousand products available to opt-out companies and is expecting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential interference with the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws on illegal tobacco advertising and their support for sporting activities, as well as banning the sale of cigarettes on a prominent basis, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has forbidden local companies and websites to place advertising on the network, but it cannot limit it to foreign sites.
"If you trade tobacco and you only have this little lasagna left, the idea of moving your product online will prove very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trademark reviews written by ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this really the case of a number of citizens who so much like the Marlboro cigarettes, who don't waste their energy and time and make a video, or is the advertising company worth it?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are making claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, although trade relations with Australia are very minor.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersec, the Government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory photo placement to prevent smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of strengthening laws is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, the USA and India.
Many smokers in Australia do not respond to innovations.
These pictures don't hit me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You're just picking up a cigarette and putting a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haege, who buys a cigarette with a picture of a mouth-to-mouth smoke in the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me drop is my little daughter.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, argues that the same packaging has complicated the problem of the settlement of goods by poles.
"I used to have time to download the new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, then we would say, what to do, okay, it's over, closing the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
Running in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
On that day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical failure and replaced it with another plane we were expecting.
So I've had enough time to think about the nature of the shock.
I won't fool you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for the trip is really boring, and there are no books, magazines, iPhones, or even shops for free trade.
In recent times, however, more and more scientists and child development experts have been disillusioned.
They say that in certain situations we and our children do not miss so much.
This forces the brain to withdraw into interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world, all of us are always in front of some screen, the benefits of the joke are beyond us.
Maybe we should try to make a fuss?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We're still going back to that.
I used to think, like many, that the boredom was the invention of a recent time when people had more leisure time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Kalgari, author of the book "Intuitive History of Fever" (Bordom: A Levely History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"It's really a shame to take a very old story," he says.
Latin inscriptions of the first century dating back to the first century were found on the walls of Pompeii.
This remains an open question as to how we understand sadness.
The problem, says John D. Iswood, Assistant Professor of York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the perception and vision of the shock has often changed.
After studying the research material on this subject and asking the task force a question of 100 people, Professor Istaud and his colleagues came to the following definition: “suffering is when people “want but can’t take care of what would bring them satisfaction”.
The difference between fatigue and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm sick.
The main cause of distress, he said, is “a violation of attention and related to a deterioration in the mood and feeling that time is slowing down”.
According to the description, depression may be very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istaud claims that despite the possible linkages between these conditions, those who are missing see the causes of problems in the world and the circumstances and those who are depressed see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when we're really just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study “An Unknown Reason: Determining Deception from Attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Istud and his colleagues referred to the previous experiment, whose participants heard a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises not related to the television programme included in the next room, others heard the same low noise sounds, so that they could hardly be understood, and the third group heard only voice recordings without a remote audio track.
Those who listened to low - sound television noticed that they were bored, that others were more often difficult to focus on, but they did not know the reason for it and attributed it to the dismay.
When we are trying to focus on a difficult or attractive task, interruption of attention can cause embarrassment, says Mark J. Fenske, Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something of no interest, “for example, looking at the flow of goods on the conveyor in search of a marriage, a distracting music can help avoid jokes”.
It is believed that when people start to climb the chair or draw the caracles on the paper, they do it out of shock, but now we know that such actions are actually just helping not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to grow up and return to learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit down quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, all of us are embarrassed: when the journey is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninterested movie.
However, different people are showing a different degree of agility.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “disgusting scale”.
Questions and allegations, such as “Many of what I have to do in a uniform and monotonous way” or “I’m too interesting, so there’s no time for anything”.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external predators.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored.
In 1991, Reid Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment that he was involved with the peer with almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and at home, and 23 per cent said they were bored abroad.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson noted that he had no data on what kind of shock data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at an early age there is a peak of a tendency to be embarrassed”, mainly because children and adolescents are not fully able to decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: Is the joke useful?
Sometimes it is not because in extreme manifestations, it can, as research shows, induce people to act absurdly and dangerously, to gamble, or to abuse certain substances in an attempt to escape the shock.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it's a joke," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But that same brain doesn't always know what to do.
If you're bored and you put this energy on the guitar or culinary experience, you'll do better.
But if you start watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll happen soon.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to cope with fatigue on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment," says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulation skills are used in different situations”, he says.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think you need to carry some shit.
However, there is nothing wrong with her.
Rather, it should be learned to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Istud agrees.
"We see this in a way that we need to experience more and more boredom, while boredom is a very unpleasant, unbearable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get rid of the constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world we've become accustomed to the constant intimidating of organs of feelings," he says, "and when there's silence, we lose and we don't know what to do."
While not sure how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a public college student in south-east Colorado, was accused of committing a criminal offence that would soon be legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove to a car on the outskirts of the border with Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police had found a marijuana car, Mr. Orosco had come to the drug storage court and had arranged for small offences, each of which was charged with a fine of $100, and the date of the trial was set.
"They treat us like criminals," says Mr. Orosko.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which has continued for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases does not depend on the law as much as on the place of consideration.
Small offences involving marijuana have already been reported in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped accusing people at the age of 21 and older of holding small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in more conservative areas of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to be responsible for the storage of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, there is a vote to prevent the emergence of new state-licensed marijuana shops in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to expect," says Daniel J. Outs, police chief in the city of Avuro in the east of Denver.
The representatives of the controlling authorities in Washington, D.C., also honor their heads.
They need to establish rules for the licensing of the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, prevents most other states from solving marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“A more orderly market in Colorado, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Washington State Alcohol Control Board.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to make any suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We don't have this case that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will become a state of uncertainty for the whole year when the State licensing system is not yet in place and the right to possession of marijuana is already legal.
However, there are still complex technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and children's gardens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in the city line, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established marijuana Law Center.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent an e-mail message that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer involve persons aged 21 years and be responsible for the small number of marijuana, and that the police would cease to identify people in these violations “from now on”.
Police chief Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of persons growing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The District Attorney of Wald in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more stringent approach.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the Office of the Prosecutor would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage its users to undergo a course of treatment.
119 persons are now charged with the storage of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The duty of our institution is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal when they are committed," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was uneven even in places such as the village of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legitimize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer take responsibility for the small quantities of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautsinger supported the decision, but also decided not to file charges for open cases involving the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes - our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people in the state of Colorado who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana into the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of the residents in different states has resulted in a disparity in the attitude of local authorities towards the state experiment with marijuana.
“There is a cultural barrier in the area of district prosecutors,” explains Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of marijuana addicts, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on marijuana.
"They have been chasing people for so long that they can't really calm down now because it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states with small quantities of marijuana as well as alcohol, are to become an experimental field at the country level to examine the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalizing parties and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, which are still planning to consider the sale and development of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization partners of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will step up in this regard.
Despite the fact that a few large-scale criminal arrests and medical evidence users of marijuana have been resuscitated, the federal government has in most cases made good use of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Control Office will not be allowed to enter the house to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they will hardly be able to close their eyes to the state-regulated state-run drugstores authorized by the new law, consider Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug advisor in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not expect the action of the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which could not have been opened earlier than a year ago.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we'll issue a license to someone, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state has voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Waitett: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy to the ancient symposium, which established two foundations of civilization -- freedom and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of study at the Faculty of History of the University of Oxford University, at the end of the 1980s, I collected some cocoons and left, which was the first scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends have been beaten with so much.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I was leaving because I had to drink from a glass of glass.
Actually, it wasn't that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically harassed and scared.
Not because of my unusual name or what I was studying in private school.
I was tormented for one reason only, and in this glorious sphere of education it seemed like this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodrow Waitett, was a famous adviser to Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservators.
You'll ask, why remember that now?
According to recent data, the new generation of law-centered students is suffering from the same scourge.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week, a group of such students needed the same protection of their rights as that afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College College of Corpus Christi in Cambridge said that they were “often actively isolated, attacked by individuals and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recently released BBC 2 documentary on student policy “The Wonders: Young, Smart and Legal Side” in which conservatives presented themselves to eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservation Association, who is driving to Rolls-Royse, wearing a silver suit and a silver tie.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are doing “abscess for higher education fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years of age, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers, said that "the university environment is widening the gap towards the left.
People who don't even know us before think of us as a cruel and cruel child of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student from the Faculty of History of the College of Corpus Christi, in which he applied for protection, called the atmosphere "invulnerable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, a new president of the Conservation Association of Oxford University, said that the attitude of the students at the student club towards those who had legal centre views had deteriorated significantly.
"It is a threat to both the intellectual discussion atmosphere and simply to the normal life of the club members," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, with an eight - year - old girl dressed and groomed.
Oxford had a lot to do with hate to a conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had voted against former student Margaret Tetcher because of reduced budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week of high school, when students met each other and teachers, I felt for the first time that I was waiting.
I still did not know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the grass of conservative students, but also took part in it with satisfaction.
Political issues -- mine attack, privatization and government disagreeing to apply sanctions against the Government of apartheid in the UAR -- have penetrated through covered wooden panels of the auditorium wall.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Whitet," said the teacher, now dead Harry Pete, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very gallant man with a cake-like face.
"Are the heretics basically not learning French or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students have been harassed.
I had tears in my eyes.
"It's advisable to take a few basic French lessons in leisure time if you're not very busy going back to society," said Pete.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone at lunchtime, and then someone grabbed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-rate student from the Faculty of English, who was introduced as a member of the University Conservation Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Those who are suspicious of the conservatives will be above them.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most conservatives claim to be Labourers."
Later, at the local pub, I tried hard to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I disagree with what Margaret Tetcher says.
The trick failed.
The professor of philosophy, politics and economy, who studied in Ethan himself, said, "You are a daughter of a Fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students took his word.
I was exported, dirty.
"How do conservators have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're hugging each other, right?"
I felt as if I had felt homosexuals before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the unsubs just under the cover of the night?
Will I have to become a liborist and hide my present beliefs?
The next three years have become like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide their conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative but also for being an adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of her supporters.
He almost didn't show up in college.
He despised it for the provinciality, tenderness and commitment of Marxist-Determinist to history.
In 1997, he graduated from the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started traveling to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London to seek refuge among relatives and uninhabited friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said regretfully.
- They can't do that, just not in the city of sleepy caves...
Even my Communist friends always act in a straight way."
His wet eyes are clouded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was bored by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection of the weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not resist pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week at a seminar, when a regular teacher of history called me “the enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In my heart, with shame, I admitted that "I've washed my parents' brains" and called them "old fools."
The respiration was not long.
The last iron in the grave of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications belonging to Rupert Merdoku.
My door was closed.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I picked up a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plax and a stick.
But within eighteen years, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen prime ministers of the country, but also today is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
About the “Valentino: master of sewing”, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascoll, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentine's Day, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high-mode payments created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unrecorded Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only character of which is "or Signor" Garavani, but it could not be written without its known clients.
Valentino has always felt a wonderful rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, which was opened before 3 March, there were personal letters and photographs of the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess Greece, and Margaret, Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of her social upheaval: from the modest port from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the cobbling of the international elite.
Being in love with the royal court is all right.
"At least they don't put off their cigarettes on your beautiful cover, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fion Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a homeless host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really liked to come to his joke in Gshaade," explains former wife Hyney Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauties such as Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Máz, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Maze mentions a charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing fashion on the plains of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentino’s style was displayed in everything – in every detail of his apartment, in her clothes, in food, and in music.
“Each of Valentino’s guests felt important and loved,” recalls the top model, which started with the model in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches are real art," she concludes.
Parentheses Around
The life of Garavani is a story not of obscenity, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Sommerset House was turned into a glamorous tower of 60 meters in length, offering a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must define on the floor, the “sightseeers” of the grass, which rubbed with the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress chosen by Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume used by Monica Whitti in Nights, or the coat of silk and leather belonging to the Fara Diba Empire.
In this audience there are such names as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskal and modeler, 2006
Many of these customers say that Valentine's first is like love, "unforgettable."
I remember him beautifully.
These were pants, shirts, life jackets and winter jackets from the 1971-72 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascoll, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they're coming to his face.
Proportion is perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia D'Arenberg did not forget the first time she was dressed in Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linh.
It was a red plate, with a beauties, a corsage in the warehouse, and a cut without a scarf.
"It was a dream that appeared," says widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is like fashion, his passion is temporary,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg is keeping her holiday payouts from a model with "maximal caution... because pay is not just a payout, it's also a set of memories that accompany him."
"King" Mode
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding pay of Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Paulos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the model is called) to make it out of an elephant’s shell with an incrust, twelve types of different circles and a slip in four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzie Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the pay is a high-end trend in the late 20th century, “returning customers from the high light”.
The elitist “style of life” for many years, now Valentino herself is her best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavani collected as many honors as any of his clients' wives.
"My attention has always attracted his precision, his calmness, his precise and unmistakable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a Christmas dinner at the Museum of Orse.
He was sitting at the table with Count Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: the Kawah-Igen mines
Four Euros Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, weighing 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of a volcano on rocky cliffs
And there are those for whom their work is hell; and others who are made to work in the fire.
Among them Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who are working on the production of cheese in the Kawah-Ijgen volcano on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the ground stops in contact with the air.
Large pieces of cheese, the total weight of which can be 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up the winding stone road.
Up to the top of a volcano, with a height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the exhausted trucks need more than 40 minutes to climb the tortoise step, with a hard balance and a cautious sloping road, so that they do not retreat and fall off.
They know that one incredible step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who broke down a few years ago with the Kawah-Ijen rock.
The Kawah-Igen miners earn 5 eurocents per kilogram of cheese they get
As it turns out, they take the road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were hanging out of the circus and, with heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the weights that the mining company had heard above, at a height of 1,850 meters.
This is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, rather, not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocentres) for every kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocentres) of petroleum production, because it is distributed throughout the day-to-day life and used for the manufacture of spikes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the marking of sugar.
"As a rule, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to store 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a poor man for such inhuman efforts, it is three more than he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high on local measures, where the price of coffee is 15,000 rupees per day (1.2 euros) and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167)," explains a truck who used to work as a stoner on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the area wasn't so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for a great reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as the cheese: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, he's always coughing, and he's got his eyes down because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Igen, whose serum had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's always coughing, and he's got his eyes down because of the toxic gases that release the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The young man who was punished for his life could be a tourist guide, an officer or a porter in the hotel, but instead he was doing the job of the mill.
Part of the dirty wooden hut with other bearers, it gets up every day at two o’clock in the night, because the cheese never stops running at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, lighting his way with a little lighthouse attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
Some 400 carriers are rubbing cheese baskets on their shoulders with the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur for cost savings and did not provide any equipment to the carriers who worked on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive some of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the photo collection, which, along with an input ticket of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the order take from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"This is a work for cattle, not for humans," says Badruzin, a 42-year-old native carrier who spent three decades in Kawah-Igen, since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will have to endure “as much as he can”, because he needs money to raise his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so durable that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual problems with breathing, arthritis, knee pain and sores on their shoulders that have deformed under the weight of the cortex.
Balanced the backbone, Unainik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions bring 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, over a distance of 18 kilometres across a narrow herd of crops.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, wide-opening mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as an ass carrier.
Time passes, but poverty continues from generation to generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mullies do with Kawah-Ijen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse their career, stress and prices of housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a husband of the patriot, you're my wife of the patriot, you'll fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may be incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of fancy beads, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a tail that uses local phrases such as "Let's put bao in the oven," to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to enable people to fulfill their national debt.
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We were the worst people in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was the subject that we had to address.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot, for example, to start ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, to make a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever doesn't realize it so easily is the Government of Singapore.
It will spend $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, prolongs maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was under 2, which is known as the percentage of substitution, in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office on Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Office, says that the reason for this is “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options regarding life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family creation,” she explained.
These changes in social norms contribute to an increase in the number of children and to the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, thus reducing the fertility rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policies, which aim at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population reduction, are causing dismay among the local population.
Singapore has websites where there is hardly any hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low pay and unwilling to integrate.
The growth in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore had won the worst outcome in the elections since independence last year.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical and immigration expenditures, Singapore ' s example also has some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making every effort not to build such a small house.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the “substance box”, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold at 46 square metres.
Nevertheless, there is the view that they can contribute to a free lifestyle and leave behind incentives for those who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, director general of the EL Developers construction company, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income increases.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidelines for the designers who had previously been put in a standby if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules could be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeians working in the centre ' s financial quarter, they seemed to have no special effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and this is why many people put it off," said the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," another young man said.
Men and women refer to their career, the stress and the prices of housing and education as reasons to prevent them from bringing children.
So, however the Government was trying to encourage its citizens to have children, in terms of birth, the last word remained behind the Singaporeans.
Individuals in offline - Individuals in online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the property of a private or “personal life which they have the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his everyday life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers involved in discussing online situations that he would probably not have shared on the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine”, in a personal plane, and “password and user name” when applied to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have uploaded to the post," says 10-year-old Jorge, when he is trying to explain the importance of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game on FB.
I'm having fun with my friends, too.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish inappropriate photographs of the naked, crimes or to write insulting or angry comments.
Jorge believes he knows 35 friends he has in the FB and nine of his follovers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother in the class has a password for one of the records.
I put on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends as quickly as possible," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
It wouldn't be considered to be someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and he ultimately admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one would have let him down or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get suffocated or demanded, I just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
It's not unusual for a boy to experience what's known as cybermobbing today.
One of my friends was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't even know who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"It's only a matter of privacy."
He then explained the consistency of the steps to establish the record safely.
Unlike Jorge, the boy would upload pictures of people who were known to be uncomfortable or confused.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like people or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and teacher in education and training, believes that it is necessary to understand that social networks are intended to inform children and adolescents.
“The Internet has appeared as a means of searching for information, but the rules of the game have changed with these sites,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Preński, a professor of education at Yel University and the author of work, the Digital Aboriginal and Immigrants, invented these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who need to be taught, while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or said at an age when maturity is not sufficient”.
"So let them be selective, while it is most important for them to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this, it's useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a photo of you like what you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos with a party, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And yet, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to conduct themselves online just as they do online.
The rules are the same.
“On the Internet, a person conducts himself with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be on social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and education consultant, explained the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
On the understanding of each of the paragraphs, they have good grounds for discussing with children the requirements for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Howard, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
The UNASUR Summit ends without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which had previously been declared binding and theoretically signed by the family.
Eff has repeatedly sought access to a document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and Administration of the President have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
On the issues of the text, they indicated that the content was presented by President Peru, Oliant Umala, during brief press statements.
Journalists ' access to information on the Summit was still limited.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly in the press room was broadcast without a sound, “closed meeting, forbidden sound”.
The few information circulated among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting, but not by Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic press release to the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was a statement by Umala, not an official document that had been completed by the summit.
Last October, Peru had adopted the IIIrd South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been declared, had not been widely accepted, despite the insistent demands of the press.
The official website of ASPA can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made sure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but that information was as limited as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court of Justice, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oliant Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague to hear statements by both parties, within the framework of the indictment that Lima had filed against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently submitting to this international court," said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“If there were, there would be, and would be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals”, added Pinner, and welcomed Umalu ' s hands in the background of the flags of the two countries.
The two Presidents ' confirmation of their submission to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week of the Bogotá Pact, which recognized its submission to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chaves; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 after the implication of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The Acting President, Oliant Umala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and for closing the summit, to hear later in the afternoon about Lima.
The head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and approved for 31 projects among South American countries, amounting to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “a significant step towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence”.
He reported that efforts were being made to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ mistrust and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America, and to take into account the collective and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in the crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis but should serve to expand our production framework and provide for a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the linkage between South America's areas, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and creating new economic patterns," the Peruvian President said in a statement read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru, and were limited by the transversal axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a high level of contact with Ecuador, but he did not provide any further details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among its neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending a regional meeting, which he hoped would meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortigo, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner on the sea dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogota.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, which are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact, which will require discussions with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are expected to attend the new president of that country, Enrique Penya Nieto.
Also in the framework of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc met in advance for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must be taught in Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must be taught in Europe”.
Correa, who attended the 6th Presidential Summit of the United Nations Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told the public television of Peru that Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and in other clashes, “they are now almost one home.”
He protected, in this context, a project to establish South American citizenship, which was approved by UNASUR countries.
"It is necessary to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reaction sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also proved himself to be a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon States is reduced and that those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights are taken into account.
Those who read lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“We cannot explain that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to a political asylum provided by Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not lay down his principles with it but respected its “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his time “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be observed”.
He also criticised Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory to investigate the alleged crime on a sexual basis, while “only Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be held by the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assang ' s physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a little legit problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is true is the danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating because of being trapped in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the asylum issue provided by Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of integrity, which would enable him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the establishment of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
And he said, "If Britain provides the guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as her legislation and as she has already done in other cases, will question Ms. Assang at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or question him about Skype, the problem will be solved tomorrow.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that it was not to tolerate “directness, mistrust and lies that undermine freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not exportable politicians, but bad journalists who support food, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, “neither the bankers nor the bourgeois nations, do not dominate Ecuador”, and added that, being re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least the following elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for revolutions under the rule of masquerade” because in reality “it has destroyed the rule of Paraguayan democracy”.
The Ecuadorian President also felt that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' wish to hold negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was “perfectly justified”.
This decision is not being complied with at the present time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be processed to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the dispute on the maritime borders, which are held in the same trial by Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to address international institutions if the two countries commit themselves to making a decision whatever it may be difficult”.
With regard to the possibility of being a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to compete for the third term, he pointed out that he considered this opportunity “with greater optimism and joy, although it was sometimes quite difficult”.
Correa assured that if he lost in February 2013, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so that this responsibility had to be acknowledged," he said.
In the event of victory, this would be my last term in the President's office, and then we'll get out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"That's the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that was already planned, routinely, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean aggravating President Chavez's health," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is a result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that its analysis of AIDS had produced a positive result.
"I seem to have been silenced," he recalls, "in spite of the doctor's all manners, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already marked his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the “older” HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994, with many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of “human immunodeficiency virus” (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatment options, too few knowledge of the disease, too little thought of the patient.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection clinic did not want to say goodbye to him, “because he had a tax.”
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do it, not a bad quality of life.
However, not knowing of their disease, so far many people have come when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at this point is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population in an exact same manner”, said HCG, Heime Andrade Villanueva, head of HIV department, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have found that AIDS is not a conviction, but life expectancy is dependent on the level of immunosuppression of patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years of age when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that whoever receives a 25-year-old HIV-positive diagnosis, according to these terms, "holding control will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Halisco died in 2011 and 187 deaths were already registered by May of this year; however, it is alleged that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there flight results so far?
Personally, I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, so there's a case in our hospital.
At least we haven't had a lack of medication for the past 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He reported a breakdown: “9 out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it can be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a mass basis for all people who ask for it.”
Their proposal is based on the opinion of specialists and officials of the Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as on patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who sought to check a private laboratory, motivated only by what a friend did and, despite his youth, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered from a sarcotic Capos, a cancer disorder, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'll die anyway, I'll get three times a week," they say, "but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I ask well, I do exercises, I take medication.
To this day, his parents just know he's got cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of practice, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with a sense of responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to bring forward his statement to those who are now experiencing fear in the context of the World AIDS Day.
Let's check if there was a risk of infection, let's find out as soon as possible whether they're HIV positive, so much better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let's let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Can not open message
Major gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are believed by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who dealt with HIV-related problems.
And the biggest is prevention.
In the places about this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, and now we're given hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but there are those who still don't have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they to you?" was the popular question, with neglect and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who did not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist said.
I suggest that this ineffective distribution be amended; that condoms not only be caught and that hundreds of them be in public toilets in places where young people often visit.
This is not the promotion of divorce.
It was not about the payment of beer and motel, Governor Emilio Gonzales replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already engaging in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisco
A total of 13,435 cases have been reported (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State has 4th place in a national rating on new and summary cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of infections are related to the sex drive, 6 per cent through the blood, and 2 per cent to the perilateral driveway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision cancelling the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes a deadline precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
The procedures in support of the survival of companies permitted by Mexican laws do not appear to be valid in the country as opposed to international agreements.
In practical terms, the decision of Judge Harlin Hail on 15 June in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas leaves unprotected Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arrest of their property on the side of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading glass producer in Mexico to be brought before the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As a starting point, while the judge notes that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern the competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph entails the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of incapacity for undertakings of a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Standardization of International Trade Law was established to that end, identifying the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote, recognized in the critical mass of the debt production that had been held before the parent company of the Vitro branch, no majority would be reached to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this opportunity.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debt was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that the voting of the branches, either by the Vitro creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely the funds of the "stewards" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of a difficult situation that she has faced since 2008 as a result of the serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
As long as the González Sada family firm appealed to the Court of Appeal itself to have the vote taken, that is, five judges, in view of the vote of only three.
In the event of a failure, an application for a certificate will be submitted, which will require a review of the trial by the Supreme Court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse than that, the court rejected the document addressed by the Government of Mexico as a friend of the curiae (“second court”), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it was exempt from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Caramboles on two sides: they fight in Vitro and they fight in the country.
Total balance
In view of the complaints put on the table by Mexicana de Aviación trade unions for several months against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the trade union association of pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Dias Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Prosecutor-General on the operation carried out by the operator to withdraw from the F/589 bank IXE 198 million pesos trust fund, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to purchase shares from the Professional Manager of the Host Company.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas father network.
Environment Dragon Mart
Assembled at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the establishment of a broad front against the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of the isolated country, with a residential area not far from the staff of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had been able to unite the governors of the south-east zone to resist monumental forces, which had compared parts of the protected territories with the land and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA death
With regard to the Government ' s refusal to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Counter-Traffic Trade Agreement, known as the English ACTA Abbreviation, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, had already gone into the archive.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has been disqualified from viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.

Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector Hettin Reyes, a busy basketball traveller, has been involved in this sport for more than 60 years and has traveled around the world, thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember basketball stories like Hector Hettin Reyes.
And before his brain bleeds into a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been involved in sports for over 60 years, as a game of small categories, as a game of the Upper basketball league, as an authority and leader of BSN with Cobboy Baymon and the President of the Federation of basketball.
“I played a lot of roles in basketball for the rest of my life, including several times when I was President of BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to Primer Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and monuments gathered along his long road, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotions, he will keep those who remember his way through Kowboev, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year speech was made as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had been able to be a part of the eight Kowboev champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or leader.
It was many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jeroma Minsi in BSN.
From that point on, Kuco Ortis, who was the great administrator, was still the leader," said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartov, who went here and was at Alabama University, Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong game for you, a 6'7".
"Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended a sniper named Raymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember what you said if Mincy brought the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Kovboev Championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I had already been the head of the Federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Championship team is the best collection you've ever seen?
She was one of the best, as was what she won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopes and Piculina (Ortis), but also the young (Howier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, Leon's (France and Edgar) brothers and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 90s due to knee trauma.
The team, which may not have been the best in personal terms but which brought us the gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With the role-playing games such as Canito Nieves, Pablo Alise and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for the players temporarily removed for trouble at the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we have won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pickulin Ortis.
Its indicators on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level like Pickulin did.
And that doesn't take his career into account in the different leagues he was playing in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flor Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of the national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had been up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalize smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the boys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the results of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, I watch music videos of my era on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I rarely go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
As told by Larry Hegman
Larry Hegman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Warte, Texas, became world famous for his leading role as John Ross Yuing, known as J.R., in the Dallas television series, in which he was engaged by a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil thief J.R. Yung in the Dallas TV series was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a production studio called Dallas.
"Larry came back to his favorite hometown of Dallas, playing again the flagship role that he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair for Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and series, was next to Hegman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was the original person and lived a full life," said Gray in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and was transferred to a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hegman became acquainted with television as a result of the role of a serial type in the light I Dream of Jeannie channel broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He was playing Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive giant girl Barbara Eden playing, and he starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the atmosphere, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles well accepted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the amazingly repulsive J.R. that led Hegman to the top of the glory.
The CBS series on the Yuingov clan and other characters in its surroundings ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot in J.R.?" designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's character is not being killed, has generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million television viewers looked at it and turned Dallas into the second number of reviews of the entertainment programme in history, after the 1983 MASH final, attracting 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (in imitation of Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey) to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R.'s grave," Hegman said in 1988.
It must be said, "There will be an honest citizen J.R. Yuing here."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the hero of the original series, mentioned on Friday Hegman as someone "great both on and off the screen".
He does not forget and do not replace for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us who is happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with a great deal of success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season were completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement that it will be with the series after Hegman's departure.
Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 at the time of his marriage to lawyer Ben Hegman.
He tried to be happy at the New York theaters in the early 1950 ’ s and then served at the English TV show from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he called his memoir "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything there that would seem able to cause pain to anyone or affect them in any way," he said at the time.
After the liver was transplanted, he began to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course begins to study the end of the light
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this fall, when professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to read the course about the end of the light, he knew that he had an unmistakable trap: the end of the "former feedback" of the May calendar, December 21, for which many people were caught as evidence of the end of the light.
But Charme had no idea what he was expecting in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "long-Armageddon", and the growing conflict where Israel is being oppressed, where Christian theories eventually believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I did not realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, it's bad for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of "the end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Walker is reading the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war can erupt.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic films and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students that it's likely that it's likely that it's impossible," Walker said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, assistant professor of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called the End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the light doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite “necessary destruction”, students should learn, prepare projects and submit final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Apocalypse canon, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night on which the light is supposed to come to an end”, Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"Places are over in two hours," Restall said about his course for high school students with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, make sure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, 23-year-old student of the religion and sociology department in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, worldly or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student at the Psychology and the Sisters' Office, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach this," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- not the professor anymore -- said he believed in the end of the day of light on December 21.
"Our first project affected May's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the light; it's just a key moment in the calendar," said Restall.
But he noted that there was apocalyptic concern in the Western culture, which included several centuries of people reacting to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the light.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dodgerti, professor of La Sal University, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly asked if he knew about any course on the end of the light there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, pointing out to the Supreme Court.
We have forgiveness from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time there had been talk of many days in the final court, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately think about the next date” or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period on which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe on that date.
Some say they're gonna go to the end of the light party.
"Maybe I'll call a friend to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the communications college.
