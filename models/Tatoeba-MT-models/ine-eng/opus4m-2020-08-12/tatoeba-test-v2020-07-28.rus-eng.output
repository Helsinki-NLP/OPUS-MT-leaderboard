I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
There were lots of girls at the party.

How did you make an impression on Tom?
What does he hate me for?
Enough to piss him off.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident didn't cost him his life.
He took off the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't take me too seriously.
Why are you so secretive?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Find the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat, it's getting hotter.
So we had to spend three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told you to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you were coming, either.
Last week, I ran into Boston on Tom.
Tom is beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary was ready.
I said because you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to a bike school.
I'll pay now!
Would you like to take a seat?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're peers.
Under the table, the coin went down.
It's empty.

I won't try to convince you.
I knew Tom would never lose.
Tom told Mary that he wanted to drink.
Why are you smiling?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you that I'm allergic to peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone again.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to make Tom bitter.
I'll teach you.
I've got food.
He's stuck with her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to drown Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win anymore.
The cosmonauts have shells.

Tell me 'cause what happened?
There's nothing I can give you.
Why would Tom have to apologize?
The results were shocking.
This room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe this?
We were under the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Shouldn't it have been October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
The charge is one of five feelings.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Something's hiding from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you invented a name for a newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.

I got infected with him cold.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.

You're helpless!
Tom plays very well on the violin.
No one's accusing you.
Next year, Krolik.
Tom almost always takes the bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I'm going to say.

I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Dennis is the only kind of sport Tom has.
Come to the castle.
Let me help you.
I was very awake, so I fell asleep right now.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
As they claim, he's a killer.
Mary didn't want to trust Halloween in an open suit, so she decided to dress like a woman.
Tom put his hat down.
Tom was waiting three hours.

I won't be like that anymore.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even slow down.

He's a newlywed father.
Men were men then.
The Swiss banks are very secret.
Once you complete your mission, you can drink as much as you can.

You want us to do this together?
All our attempts have been wasted.
He poured himself another glass.
Now I'm going to start listening to the patient, make sure they've followed the procedure correctly, and you're going to have to use it tomorrow.

You're late for school again.
What's your favorite moviemaker?
So I didn't have to ask twice.
You need to get to Boston.
I was so excited.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan.
This is the house I live in.

I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The officer was lying on the table with a white shot.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told them that my car was stolen.
We can discuss it later.
It's a little helpful.
The cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak in public?

I don't really like Tom.
So you have to change your plans.
Someone bit him.
Anything else you want to know?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new dress, Mary?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Shall we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
That's what everybody said they adopted him.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Get her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Enjoy it.
Tom wakes up from a deep sleep.
You're big.

I'm very unhappy.

We won't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law that prohibits violating the law.

Weird hearings are coming.
I know you're rich.

Who taught you how to dance?

I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I don't believe it.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not gonna waltz.
He went to the car and left.
So tell me about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do a homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this medicine yet.
Tom's been having teeth for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope is dying last.
That's the girl who came here yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.

Don't make me do this.
Why did you smile?
Tom usually goes to work on a bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.

Do I think so?
Everyone's got hats except Tom.
She gives him everything he wants.
Is that sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have such a big one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
It's just exacerbating the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of the washbasin in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I get your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.

Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't move in any other way.
Who's in the blue football?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
The shark's good for the eye.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself married.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.

His house behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you in a good shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 arrests.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave so much encouragement, she poured a bottle of wine through him and walked out of the restaurant, and the dead silence broke out.
You're two-year-old Tom.
We met them.
Tom's beautifying the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, who's in prison, never writes Som.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
That's very easy to get out of.

That's what it's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to sneak out.
How many airmen in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Get back together, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?

Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in winter hills.
I own French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it is probably not true.
Leave this where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
She kissed Mary last night.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.

I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of company.
This area has changed completely.

That's how you feel.

Red better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a few words?
Don't sound like it.
When was Tom arrested?
We'll go at 6:00.
The ostrich was the victim of a lion.
Tom didn't want to go.

It may lie in water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom looked like he didn't understand Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw how it happened.
I don't think there can be any other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.

There's nothing more to say about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Get back home early, Bill.
She sat on the chair and read the magazine.
From this point on, it's forbidden to cry.

You didn't tell me Tom was speaking French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.

I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy this.
I've never seen you in my hat.
Put it on the counter.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It's pointless to pretend you're making me believe that I believe in what you don't!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was forgiven.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
Eventually, he got sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, it's better for me.

It's just sovereignty.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
Account, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You're about to have your birthday.
Take care of it.
I don't like those boots.
She's been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's why it's under thirty.
Have you had a drink?
He certainly is the best fit for this work.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm in love.
It doesn't seem like you're very busy.

I know what's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live close enough to you.
Tom's following horses.
Why wouldn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they're killed.
They turned Tom off the life-saving device.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom can both of you.
Tom closed the roof.

When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are talking.

So you helped wash the window?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm out here.
Don't tell 'cause it really happened.

Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.

Your kids know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives you fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to make time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, spoke in a dreadful, Jewish way, the Galileo dialect of Aramaic rather than the Hebrew, thus showing the inability of claims of the existence of a sacred language, which is used in prayers particularly close to God.
Tom finally changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid $30.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast didn't make a mistake.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.

And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Is this my book?
It's a routine job.
Who else do you have on your list?
So don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Is that what you saved me?
He horribly hopped in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?

Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to reach the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You've got a voice that's upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell him to be here by half the third.
It's not God's message of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you don't have to tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where'd you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of hunger.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some corrections.

Tom at the kitchen, my cup.
The temperature dropped to three degrees.

Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overloaded.
Where do you want to go on the next exit?
How great is that?
I'm going to be hungry.
Tom wasn't hanging out with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is sold well.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do this to us.
His words upset me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to do it.
Hand her over to me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response was a shock.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in answer?
I'm about to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I've got a big dream.
So no one has to do anything but themselves.
I'm from Sydzuoka.
Tom slept in his backyard all the trees.
Saturday is the day when he is free.
I wonder what happened to her.

He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I understand.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy for what it is.

Tom's yelling at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
That's what Mary said from Australia.
She knows you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Again and again in our lives there are obstacles, some calling them problems, others talking about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him to the fish.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to get out of the company.

Shall we go?
I knew it could be on you!

What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't let her go.

If I had the money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom's smiling?
She went to Paris.
That's right now at school?
Let us know, please.
Tom slammed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in my room.
Do you have any pain?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!

He'll definitely come.
Is there a message?
Last night, Tom called me unexpectedly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the bottles.
I decided to give up.

I have an assignment for Tom.
"How was the accident?" "No one knows."

If you want to be alone, I'll go.

My eyes are hurting.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foresaw the reconciliation in Jesus Christ of royal authority and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went home.
It's not thin, but it's strong and it's not breaking.
It's all a little stupid.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's amazing.
I don't think you sent me that order.
Six to five for television viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.

I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
That'll help you if you ask him.
I hope no one's seen you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I was pretty.
Do you cry often?
We did not expect such results.
I've already read it.

Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made it clear.
We've been waiting three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time may change, but human nature is the same.
It looks like something really upset.
I brought the liver.
Next year Tom will teach French.
I've listened to her before.
So I advised you to rest.
Why is it bothering you?
The worst part of the trip is back.
We're not going to miss you both.
Don't be so stubborn!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do this!
This knife was very good for me.
How do you know what I had?
You're gonna have this for a minute.
I would very much like to change that situation.
We've taken care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They won't come back.
You don't have to trust any of them.

I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry he did this without you.
You've got blood coming out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore that.
Where'd you meet Tom?
Where's the neighborhood of the supermarket?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you are a liar, join in.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He never was.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry up, and then you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they get you?
Where are you going to live?
Usually I'm a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is in danger.

He said he'd do it.
So we didn't have to leave.
Mary was healed after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy his life.
I want you to say a word for me.
Nobody likes me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom in the course." - "Yes, you told him?" - "No, he knew everything."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand more French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something.

What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.

We've got a lot to buy.
Yesterday, I read an interesting book.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.

I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.

When are you leaving?
Don't look.

I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to lying down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious dish I've ever eaten.

Why are you so direct?
Go to your father and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a short comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take seriously.
Members of this tribe moved along the river.
I'll do it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one's got a thing to do before she thinks.
I don't think it's weird.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When are you gonna get the wheat?
Tom told Mary that he was ready to do this.
Does that make sense?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.

That's what I understand.
Tom's not tall, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Come on, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clear.
What would you have done?
He disappeared in the crowd.
What, don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom broke up with Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is unending!
This box hangs a ton.
He gets it because he's a jockey.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

He said he was going to kiss me.
Don't look at me.
You're having fun?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I was free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's got a hard-pressed paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.

I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they drove to a mountain resort.
You won't tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.

Can you get closer?
She's light-headed.
What actions do you expect from Tom?
She seemed quite calm.

Everything's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree out there.
You usually wear a bike helmet?
Tom will do it.

Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom might say.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It'll bring the misfortune of your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.

She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?

I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's got to talk to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.

It's all over time.

What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.

I said 'cause Mary has to do it.
You two idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long have you been there?

I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the leader of Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone shouted.
Which one better?
We thank you for your help.

Did you tell Som?
Me!

Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.

Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must be bored.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
How much time now in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what they told us.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll be a father, you'll get it.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where'd you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
What do you think this year will be a Christmas snow?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I owe it to one of my friends at the tent.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me the same.
I'd like to have a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You don't have a second chance.

All accounts have to pay me.

This time, I'll forgive him.
I like Chinese food very much.
It's easier than you think.

Get out of here now.
May I take a look at your rights?

How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom's burning the shit.
He wrote a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much is that?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A glass of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note.
Are you a Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since the third half.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.

Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll ever thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Get out of here! Get out of here!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I just fell asleep after two hours of night.
Mary had no desire.
So it wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say it's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
I think she's healthy.
Tom was in a broken skull.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't waiting for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you eaten yet?
I love a bad peach.
How much do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain won the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincible ones.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
I know Tom can draw.
They're stuck.
I didn't know what it would be impossible to do.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you kill her?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are about one year old.
I was impressed.
I don't advise you.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How is faith different from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather permits, tomorrow we'll climb to the top of the mountain.
We both know her.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated she seemed.
His gray eyes glistened, and his pale face was usually brought back to life and covered with a Roman.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands have been lifted from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Be careful.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon has destroyed many homes.
This man was destined to die.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
It's in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than to learn.
He was taken to be his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do this until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, all of a sudden, they're in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're bitter.
Last night our granddaughter was born.
Tom's suit is a pirate.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the doll.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't exactly remember what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she's not supposed to do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll give you a hand.
We are proud of our achievements.
So we had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you honest?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not the girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I eat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one for whom he betrays himself?
King Harald Hormsson, known as Harald Sinezubius, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
That's where Tom could stay longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been so hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to plant flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Do you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gess.
Actually, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought before a court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve persons in the jury.
What exactly did Tom do in the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started meeting each other.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very busy.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea what Tom was going to do.
That's one more day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombones.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is known worldwide for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Enjoy the oven, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Leave it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as an officer.
Tonight's gonna be cold.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Alice faced, waiting for the answer, was a sudden war; it was a loud noise, so sharp to break her drums, and so loud to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary bring things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published each year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she had asked for.
What do you hate her for?
My car broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was just trying to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why didn't Tom sleep?
The way he wakes up, the way he responds.
We took the canoe.
Have you ever tasted banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look up to the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his sonnet.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
She's stuck in a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your kid can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President is four years old.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Can't you solve this question?
Tom and Mary are here.
So, what would you do that for?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have Tom's picture.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to push the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Do you feel okay?
He's just sitting there.
I think it's up to you.
She knew it wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom was talking last night in his sleep.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell you 'cause you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got a little bit of stuff.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of crazy.
Not bad for her.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe that it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and neat.
I suspect that's why we have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face is beautiful.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The room needs a new stove.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the crisis?
How long do you want to leave?
She had a leg pain.
It's a risk that we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
Why is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you envy.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom did it a lot.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped So do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious things are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there'll be an opening time.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the lighthouse and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Foma left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was impressed.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait till you hear it.
What'd you split up for?
Milk can be made of butter, cheese, and so on.
You don't have the authority.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself properly.
Do you like jazz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like a stranger.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked in response.
Tom said Mary was enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll do it if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
Nobody starved except me.
That's very exciting.
No snowflake in the snowflake finds itself guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.

Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been tricked.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who's the one to play with?
I need a light coat.

That's a very bad idea.
It's above you.

Tell them we're going.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't close it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Shall we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so harsh with me.
Now I'm in charge of the council!

He's not.
You're very smart.

She thought I'd cheat on her.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom took his secret with him to the grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?

We're teachers.
I'm sure you like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do that again.
Are there any immigrants?

Tom's got questions left.
Are you looking for anyone?

So we didn't have to hide.

That's a good sign.
Some believe that they are protected by the guardian angel.
Tom has destroyed his bank account.
She's in the hotel now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he gave it his attention.

When does this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The last Friday still left a trail on the bedside.
Is anybody seeing anyone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
By the time you came back, I was gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped meeting him.

Is that sarcasm?
And do not do what you will regret.
You envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

Why did you say that?

There's no exception in the waiter.
If you need help, say it.
Can I go home earlier today?
You wouldn't survive for anything.

There's a shopping area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your doll.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom's a bad drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom came up with a couple of suggestions and checked them out at Mary before he went to Tatoebu.
I know where you're keeping your money.
Finally, the school's finished.
It's a long ride.

I had no idea you could do that.
Tom took off the car.
Tom knew something about Mary that John didn't know.
The answer is no.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I've raised my head negatively.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
You ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Come see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he was coming back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
Open box.
Did you talk to Tom about this?
Is this a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me I still need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
Yellow leaves.
I woke up and she wasn't.
We have a lot of food today.

Although I felt something strange, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went into the army.
Why can't you take me the way I am?
The bear is black.
Tom doesn't even know what Mary did.
I don't know who'll be at the meeting.
It's hard for the president.
If I'm hungry, you'll eat.
I was terrified.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six is equal to eighteen.
‘Scala’ means an anagram of ‘laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in the anti-racism rally.
You did it fast.
I need to spend hours two minutes ahead.

I'm not afraid of that at all.

They have a large amount of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hat.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to sleep.

There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in corruption among our country's officials.

The train will be at this station for about two minutes.
Get up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.

In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking rather than driving.
As it turned out here, it's impossible to find out now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
The majority of the votes were manufactured.
You lied to us, didn't you?

I probably know that.
Be an adult, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?

Tom had the sex board removed by a stripper.
Don't get away with it.

She's above the sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
In the most beautiful colors, the sharpest rods.

That's what I'm saying.
That's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels so much better.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know how different Iraq is from Iran.
That's why they told them not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom -- he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw the helicopter myself and started to shake my hands.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?

Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no air conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They've blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom hoped Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do this again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they'll do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary does.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom's gonna be working on these exits.
Give her the phone, please.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President ' s attempts to introduce stricter arms control have been thwarted by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You've got enough time.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father's a good shot.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Famma tried to explain the situation of Masha.

No one paid attention to me.
So there were thirteen at that time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Look for yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he came to celebrate.
Why did he need it?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bad.
It didn't take time.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read it.
Thank you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks have made it possible to find a lot of information about the person before they meet.
What really happened in the last exits in Boston?
What does it mean to learn?
These Persians are not very sweet.
I don't think these black Fridays can be taken out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay her.
I can't forgive his lazy.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.

They offered us their help.
Tom was determined to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are Zaccad friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
It's something of a celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of darkness.
So I made dinner.
Russia has become the second superpower.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Separate this powder into a glass of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's get one of those ready lunches sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did it happen that you knew each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You speak like my grandmother.
I don't have any cousins.
Let's see something else.
Do you think it's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted it.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You're very helpful.
Don't stand in the door.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he's coming back now?
If you're up, you're asleep!
I'm afraid I don't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
Friday we're going to dinner.
What's your dad's name?
You don't turn the radio off?
I just don't remember what Tom said.
Tom's an experienced player.
I wasn't ready.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a live imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?

I explained that to her.
Tom is unresolved.
Nuclear baton!
I'll delay my departure if it rains.
Everything must be clear.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The mixture of three main colors produces black.
Get in there.
When do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want the neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
How long is Tom gonna be in the hospital?
I want you to stay with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray earnestly.
What will you do if the war starts again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold disaster is the California gold disaster, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your picture.
I'll meet new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You've brought Tom up.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss you so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, did you eat?
Who did you give it to?
I held him as a doorman.
Nobody's asking you to do this.
I forgot today's April 1st.
Please stop singing this song!
Tom tasted the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The eastern and western parts of the city are divided by the river.
Why are you sweating?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
So it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms up, it grows.
We could have done it.
Doctor said that's why surgery is needed.
I've changed my toothpaste recently.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I came to visit you.
I feel amphibian.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you sleep?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do this!
It's all quiet.
Let the dust fall.
Why are you so stubborn?
He's stuck in his Chinese-language teacher, but with all this hormonal stuff, he's stuck in almost every meeting room.
I'm glad to inform you that I've completely recovered.
I've written a lot of proposals for an expert.
I like the aquarium more than the pastel.
I can't make an exception.
He's picturing fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up the book.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes a fisherman like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan proved to be a supporter of the white race.
I'll try to pull them off.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better prepared than I am.
He's floating like a gun.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to buy.
She brought the ball.
"Tom, hurry." "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've already faced this problem.
I'm trying to say that in French.
I'm not like anything else.
I was able to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunscreen.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus is going to be plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're classic.
I had a date with my friends.
Jane's forgiveness has made us very sorry.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What should I tell him?
You look stunning.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold a smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "girl"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is the realization that you didn't even know what you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's gone blind.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in the city?
Question completed.
Please turn off the radio.
It was said that he was not sure of his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take your jacket off if you're warm.
So many of them.
He couldn't act on the principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You're probably gonna be out of here at 3:00.
It was an easy solution.
Mary said she'd come early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a wealth of imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom supports cleanliness in his room.
These three books belong to Som.
He jumped from one theme to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly put Tom's shirt on.
The bank's robbery seems to have been planned even before the small ones.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Wake up a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
Bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her why?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" racism.
It's a meatball, isn't it?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like more?
They don't respect him.
There is no selection.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You may not answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell you 'cause you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his word.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running away.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Yes, everyone, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Forgive me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In view of remaining ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom barely breathes.
Dogs don't know the color.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a notable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
You have to tell him not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he does.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why Mary has to tell the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call that?
There's something to do.
She made him a gift.
Mary's in the room.
Attention!
In that very second, I fell in love with this language.
It's safe, isn't it?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's a close friend of mine.
Don't do two times at the same time.
You didn't have to go into the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
Tom's never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I haven't forgotten the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We appealed to the noise manager in the neighborhood.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the righteous.
You're gonna meet him every new year, and you're gonna spend it.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any togetherness is dangerous, especially so.
You could've stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this to the surgeon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Go back to your age, then.
You know how to juggle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I don't bear animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's slowing down today.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of trouble.
The conference room is busy now.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's leaking here.
You see the star?
Ask Tom.
Get the rope!
You've spoken so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure it's sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
That's why I feel so much.
Nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I don't work today.
That's what you said last time.
I know better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like this.
You're hiding something, aren't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom was very young.
The account shall be paid for the first number of the following month.
My French terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an extortion attempt.
I can't speak for a colleague.
Tom lives a long way from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight's over with the dragon.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave a message.
You chose not that man.
They risked a lot.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, she was driving with the mules.
Tom talks to his grandparents in French and his parents in English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was not easy to find.
They're all dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the 20th century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing this.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn't be.
He got out of bed.
Trains are scheduled.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it's impossible not to be confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What motivates you?
I gave Leila my computer.
Put your hand on it.
I was hoping you'd come back.
You think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say that anyone in America can be president, but it probably isn't.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long does the train arrive?
How long does this train go to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John had met each other.
When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I made him some flour.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Please translate it into French.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was growing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me what happened.
Cut the hair and kill it.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
In Tom's weak heart.
That's why she'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his upper boat.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do this on your own.
No one's seen you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I have to wait.
Yesterday was Thursday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here familiar with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary wears a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad perspectives in this town.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't said that yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't get the people to do this.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't bear this color.
They sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors begged us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot in the bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust it.
She's got some flaws.
It's interesting why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you don't like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you or the enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
The titles and awards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting's late.
I'll find out.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom drinks beer.
You don't want to do it. Don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to eat on these exits?
Come on!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're going to get lost.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy was fleeing to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a cab driver when he lived in Boston.
It looks like an optimist.
He's not buying a camera.
I did everything I could to help Som.
I'll connect you with her.
She received the highest scores.
Tom can explode.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I was leaving in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of a cell phone.
I'd like to go.
You owe me notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
I'm dead.
Now only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my thumb yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said it was a pleasure for you to come back.
My car's covered in dove shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make that mistake anymore.
I don't care whether we stay or not.
I arranged for her to marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life for that day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into a hole.
It wasn't him.
Do you have friends on the census in Indonesia?
You might need to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your Zones?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said Tom.
Where are you?
I didn't die yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: they'll ever transfer it.
You won't find a job here.
Can you hear me for a minute?
They all loved you.
We're family souls with him.
I have your granddaughter.
I'm sorry I wasted your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How'd you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started taking care of her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning on doing this yesterday.
It's been a while, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of getting dressed.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hunting and hard.
Because, worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I get you a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
He hasn't been lying all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
The show has to start watching when all the seasons are down!
Road accidents happen every day.
Where'd you go to go to the sledgehammer?
Were you in a parking lot?
It's a bulletproof perspective.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a scarf pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brake go.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
Blow up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged her.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children yet?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like it.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a confident idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all rabbits.
Tom thinks it's a sin to waste products.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is heading right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English got much better.
Let's go to church.
Tom shakes whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief steals the cow.
Isn't that a good swim?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of the past.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go to Boston with us next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything's going on.
What day is it today?
Let's give it another chance.
I just want you to take me the way I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in her mouth?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I should stick together.
I've only heard good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's gonna be mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstein.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Chemodan Tom's empty.
Oh, my God, it's hot.
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank me for your son.
Looks like her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell him because I'm going to go to his house today.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer brought courage to his people.
Tom will never find her.
In any case, I'm now thinking of trying things like this.
I don't understand much about hunting.
For the first time, I'm cooking meat at home on the grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many Zones do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
All of this was known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay.
Mom, look what I found.
Interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I cut every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking home work?
According to mythology, Prometheus took the holy fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before it burned.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our town, but Tom doesn't care about them.
You have six unread messages.
Get your best game.
We take the checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
“Eh, here you are so boring.” — “My boy, all of you are striving for this world” — “Here I am! Your Majesty, hannon and his servants have seized the island of Corridor.” — “Hm. What can we...” — “How can we...” — “So can Link resist hannon” — “So can we?” — “Healthy! I take my sword!” — “No sword.” — “Ah?” — “No sword!” — “There is no sword!” — “No” — “No” — “No” — “No” — “How does the “aah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah” a copy? — “No” — “How does the smoke bombs” — “No.” — “Now take this gun?” — “Yes!”
Do you know who's playing this song?
Is your time right?
I'll see you tomorrow at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing great.
I met her on the way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.

Do I hear you now?
I didn't order that.
Tom's complaining?
That's why they believed in it.

They've gone astray in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
I have a heart attack.
My father won't let me into a movie.
I saw the boat sink.
Instead of going to work, I asked for a whole day at home.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbors?
My father usually watch TV after dinner.
He drinks wine.
Please cut yourself a apple pie.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it in time if you leave now.
There was no special problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure finding a place will be easy.
I took two aspirin pills from the main pain.
You're in my heart.
He picked me up for the last time.
Don't laugh!
Love does not obey anyone.
If you come to that now, you'll probably stop watching it.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfi without a shirt.
Whose kingdom was this church built?
Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater flows through this tube.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who makes friends with boys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one suggests that you do that.
He works in this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut down the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
That's where John and I were sitting in one camera.
I didn't want to swim.
He had a beer.
In our day, it's hard for a man to be... alone.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom wake up!
I'm making my nose plates.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She went out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning resin?
It didn't happen here.
When does your father come home?
I understand.
Tom's got Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my mind.
Tom's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You must be tired.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair's wet from the pot.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom lived on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it takes?
The boat manager is a complimentary master.
That's Mary's wedding, isn't it?
All the chimneys in the park were busy.
Someone has to tell her that.
I've got it all working.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in a room with his brother.
I'm not an idiot.
You're gonna do it, aren't you?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go down if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromic acid?
We've got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the haystack.
I asked Tom.
That's why we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Key!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a yard.
I respect his views, although I do not agree with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call cheap?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the sex.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You've been planning on staying for a long time?
We had an early meal, and we left at the same time.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're straight.
Careful, don't rub anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He was sitting right across from me.
The cell was open.
It's my fault.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
May I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Big apples.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's drinking?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered how his lips would taste.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was detained because of strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What did you take that I don't want to go from?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in the hat room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask Tom to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out on the street.
I've been walking down the street. I've seen my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's your life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her native language is French.
It's a silly coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naïveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Tom's kid lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can tell you, don't believe him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcoming, and she has a lovely smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, the babies sleep under the cobblestones.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry to bother you.
He who has never left his country is a slave to prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was opposed to me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you that way.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust the machine.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're her peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Couldn't you leave the door open?
It'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's two older than me.
Tom knows what they made was a mistake.
In Japan, the climate is mild.
Check again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized game.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France once, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
It's just getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, and we can open the window again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna go out when I called.
I don't have to bear that.
Always walk away from the road to the right.
We are asked to be presented in order.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can drop you if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have this problem?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice as a melodic song is cheese to me.
What is it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left on a glass of print.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French isn't getting any better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you can help Som.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
I haven't been paying attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell a house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Find some more light.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but she'll be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had the time to do this, I would.
Do you see the boat, Tom?
Big name?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I'm in pain.
You know how I was busy?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I'll trust someone.
She's a "Sex in a Big City" fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christa's working, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What's wrong?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's move over here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She's speeding up the giraffe when she sees the dog.
He's not much more than me.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
This peache is beautiful.
You see that?
Tom's not in the mood for that.
You didn't have to go to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
That's what you used to say.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that such a level of science would have made such a fundamental mistake.
He doesn't have any evidence.
You look bad.
He was very good at swimming when he was young.
I'm writing to a friend.
He's very good at playing tennis.
She misled the students.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I've filled the buckets up.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What are we living for?
Will it rain today?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I often drive a car.
That's why he doesn't like the movie.
Just get in there.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I've got two of you tosseds.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you enough?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting to the next day.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would you?
That's why Mary and I need to get some rest.
He was asleep.
It could've been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little.
You'll be there sometime.
Tom's fine with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom earns three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
Tomorrow's gonna be snow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to preparing, no one will compare with Mary.
You're not your own lately.
Tom lost his leg while attacking the shark.
I burned it for you.
We'll do it as time goes on.
Next year, I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your brand collection.
It'll take forever.
That's a little bit higher, Mary.
He doesn't seem to know.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This fabric comes to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a couple of times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder, said Tom.
We want to take off the apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't drink anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom for a couple of inches above Mary.
I'm glad you suggested it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why Does It Need Milk?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a car in custody instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's splitting up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give it to him.
Run, they're arresting you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom usually meditated every morning.
Did you check your bills?
He tried to make a short story.
Room without books, like a body without souls.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
Nobody understands me.
There's so many stars in the sky, I can't read them.
Everyone came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom shouldn't have asked me to do something a few times.
Let's wash the dishes today, whoever loses the stone on the paper!
I'm so sick of you.
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's running away speaking Russian — at least he told me so.
Tom's a third grader.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overloaded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston well, do you?
The orchestra started to play.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
This isn't my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a hit man.
He was born at seven o'clock in the morning of 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom's just white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We have only three rules.
She bought one of her own.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has noticed a lot.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifty-five is equal to seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he'll say yet.
My hands are up.
I've been driving my wife away.
Finally, she did it.
It's disgusting that they weren't insured from the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was split into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, here you are so boring!
Let's compare reading the book to traveling.
Tom saw Mary go into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't have enough Boston.
She writes letters all the time.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do this.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I don't have disobedient children.
It's Tom who bought me.
What you said made everybody angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She demonstrated her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do this.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Bob's next school festival will be the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been snoring all day.
I found out from the accent that he was American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Have mercy!
Tom's been obedient.
Everyone in my generation thinks about it the same way.
I live for it.
Do you know how to puke?
Duke reigns in many lands.
Well, they're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel like you're home.
That's not going to end well!
He looked like he hadn't eaten for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling the goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know the girls?
Tom improved his coin.
Why didn't you get out of your room?
If not for God's sake, it's all allowed.
Both of us are Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please hang your belts during the flight and landing.
That's why and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
You built all of this yourself?
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
Can we put that in a different way?
From here he looks great.
Wooden houses are easily burned.
Let's make it a party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
It's very comfortable to cover.
I'll report this tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's in the back.
I want to listen to your side.
I'll wait here for his arrival.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need this anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a tough guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have any fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the ring.
What kind of bird can't fly?
It's got to be over.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died in his 70s.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexie?
You look like a girl.
Here's some photos.
What's going on on the tenth channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's ready for lunch.
Tom's a palate.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give up his emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they leave?
I didn't see you.
You're just noticing what's obvious.
He had cancer.
You're responsible for what happened.
He's exactly like hours.
I know where you're going.
You get it on the flight.
Let's double it.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
On the writing table, the cat.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're out of your way.
Tom was a drunk smoker.
Tom put on his gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to the weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snowflake?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son's inherited disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
Better protection is an attack.
This fall she's getting married.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easy.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't?
We drove back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe this?
Thank you for the correction.
You've lost your mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted evidence.
Tom's running his gang.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking to the calf at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
Yeah, wherever you put it.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seven and thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
Dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually go up one by one.
Tom's been out for another year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All hunters can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
I've only learned to drive in my 30s.
I'm glad he didn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not hard enough to cut the meat, so I took advantage of my piercing knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll be able to adapt to village life soon.
Keep the water nearby.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We've all been fine.
The river is deep down here.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
I guess you should tell him.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately when they are to be written is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the residue of the prepared rice?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book should be read.
Tom and Mary took classes before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
The woman's not a frog, you're not gonna get off her feet.
I'll follow you at 6:00.
So I teach French.
I like to learn other languages.
Mary's eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom is planning to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give it a chance.
I like fruits.
Tom's a fool.
He's trading cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"You think he'll come?" "I hope he won't."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate a game.
They shot at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave the rose to Mary.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They took the first bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
Here, there must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.

Have you ever spoken to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the deal.
Tom was sitting on his feet.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes a mole beats twice in one place.
I don't care.
Leave it on.

I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonolu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last one.
Tom signed an application.
You tried to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.

We don't know so much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom's nowhere to be seen.
That's why I told you to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Couldn't you close the window?

I'll give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom started suspecting something was wrong.

I don't think that's why I'm gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.
He's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Everyone's having fun?
Tom's watching a show on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep on the street today.
That's what Tom showed Mary, how's it going?
Amazing, isn't it?
I cut the rose.
School's only five minutes away.

Tom swallowed a beer.
I'll tell you what to do.
A man born in France is a Frenchman.
I'm not used to it.
It's a gift from her.

Don't feed the river.
Hey, it's me.
Now tell me something about you.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom's teaching my children French.
Tom says he didn't eat for three days.
Doesn't look like Tom's having fun.
There's some stuff here.
I had to tell him to get up there.
We're done.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me a picture.
You said you could help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't look at her face.
It could be.
Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, isn't it?

Tom told me he was staying home.
I lived in a three-room apartment when I was in Boston.
Don't look at that.

That's why it's over thirty.
Tom, we got a little hug.

After I got on the train, I noticed that I forgot the paperwork at home.
How long after Tom died?
Are you playing the guitar?
We hope we don't have to do that.
The situation is under our control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
It's obviously inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.
